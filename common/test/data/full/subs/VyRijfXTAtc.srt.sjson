    "So in order to write the node\nequation for that node, I&#39;m", 
    "going to sum the currents\nexiting the node.", 
    "And so let me do that.", 
    "So the current going up\nis simply V 0 minus", 
    "VS divided by RL.", 
    "That&#39;s the current going up.", 
    "And then the current going\ndown is simply ID.", 
    "And that is 0.", 
    "I can multiply out.", 
    "Notice that I have not replaced\nthe actual equation", 
    "for the current yet.", 
    "I&#39;ll do that in a moment.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to multiply\nout by RL.", 
    "So I multiply out by\nRL, I get IDRL.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to move VS\nto the right-hand side,", 
    "leaving V 0 on the\nleft-hand side.", 
    "So I&#39;ll leave V 0 on\nthe left-hand side.", 
    "I move VS to the right-hand\nside, and move IDRL also to", 
    "the right-hand side.", 
    "So there is my V 0\nin terms of ID.", 
    "So now let me go ahead and\nsubstitute for ID.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to substitute this\nexpression for ID into", 
    "the expression here.", 
    "And that will give me, V 0\nequals VS minus K divided by", 
    "2, VN minus 1, all\nsquared times RL.", 
    "And this is for VN greater\nthan equal to 1 volt.", 
    "Now, what happens when\nVN less than 1 volt?", 
    "So what&#39;s the value of V 0 when\nVN is less than 1 volt?", 
    "Well, when VN is less than\n1 volt, ID is 0.", 
    "So when ID is 0, then V 0 is\nsimply equal to VS. This is", 
    "for VN less than 1 volt.", 
    "So let me mark this down into\na box, because I am going to", 
    "be using it.", 
    "And just so we don&#39;t lose sight\nof it, let me go ahead", 
    "and put this into a nice little\nbox and put a little", 
    "star around it.", 
    "So we&#39;ve done the quick analysis\nof this dependent", 
    "source circuit.", 
    "And I&#39;ve obtained a V 0\nversus V [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "that I set out to do.", 
    "So when I said solve it, I was\nlooking to have you do a V 0", 
    "versus VI [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "for me.", 
    "So really, there&#39;s not\nmuch else to this.", 
    "So you&#39;ll just keep this\npicture in mind.", 
    "And let&#39;s go ahead and plug\nsome numbers into this", 
    "equation to see what it\nreally looks like.", 
    "So on the right-hand side here,\nI&#39;ve just summarized", 
    "what you&#39;ve seen so far.", 
    "This is the expression that\nI had marked with a star.", 
    "This is not a great-looking\nstar, but", 
    "pretend it is a star.", 
    "And so this was the circuit\nI showed you earlier.", 
    "And V 0 equals VS minus the\ncurrent times RL, for VI", 
    "greater than 1 volt, and\nV 0 equals VS for", 
    "VI less than 1 volt.", 
    "Let&#39;s plug in some numbers.", 
    "So for example, let me choose\nVS equals 10 volts.", 
    "Let me pick K to be 2 milliamps\nper volts squared.", 
    "And let me pick RL\nequals 5 kilohms.", 
    "So let me go and solve this\nfor these values of the", 
    "various devices.", 
    "I have two cases here.", 
    "So there&#39;s two cases,\none and two.", 
    "So the case one, for VI greater\nthan or equal to 1", 
    "volt, here&#39;s what I get.", 
    "I get V 0 equals.", 
    "So VS here is 10 volts, so\nlet me write that down.", 
    "Oh, let me just go write\nthis down [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "VS minus K/2.", 
    "Notice that VI equals VN so I\ncan just use VI here, minus 1,", 
    "the whole squared, RL.", 
    "And so VS is 10, minus.", 
    "So K is 10 to the minus\n3 milliamps.", 
    "That&#39;s 10 to the minus\n3 amps divided by 2.", 
    "And then I have VI minus\n1, all squared.", 
    "And RL is 5 times 10 to the 3\nohms. So I can simplify this", 
    "whole thing a little further.", 
    "And so what do I get?", 
    "So in this case, I&#39;m going to\nget the following expression.", 
    "Oh, I forgot to substitute for\nthe 2 for K, so it&#39;s a little", 
    "bit of a blunder here.", 
    "There we go, I put at 2 there.", 
    "That works.", 
    "So let me simplify this\nout a little bit.", 
    "So 2 and 2 cancel out.", 
    "10 cubed and 10 raised to\nminus 3 cancel out.", 
    "So I&#39;m left with 10 minus 5,\nVI minus 1, all squared.", 
    "And this is for VI greater\nthan 1 volt.", 
    "And then for VI is less than\n1 volt, what do I get?", 
    "I get V 0 from 2.", 
    "So here, I get V 0 equals VS,\nwhere VS equals 10 volts.", 
    "So I could plug these\nexpressions, so there&#39;s V 0", 
    "here, for VI greater than or\nequal to 1 volt, and then V 0", 
    "equals 10 volts for VI\nless than 1 volt.", 
    "Let me just go and plot\nthis for you.", 
    "It&#39;s not too hard to plot.", 
    "So this is my VI-axis.", 
    "And this is my VO.", 
    "And this is 0.", 
    "There are a couple\nof interesting", 
    "points on this curve.", 
    "Certainly, one of them\nis the 1-volt point.", 
    "So let&#39;s see what we have. So\nwe start where VI had 0.", 
    "So when VI is 0--", 
    "in fact, when VI is\nless than 1 volt--", 
    "V 0 is 10 volts.", 
    "So let me write down\n10 volts here.", 
    "And so what this says is that,\nuntil VI is 1 volt, V 0 is", 
    "going to be 10 volts.", 
    "What happens next?", 
    "So when VI is greater than\n1 volt, then this", 
    "equation takes hold.", 
    "Notice that if I substitute VI\nto be 1 here, I get 10 volts,", 
    "as expected.", 
    "And now, as VI increases, I\nsubtract the square of VI", 
    "times 5 from 10.", 
    "So starting from 10, I&#39;m going\nto subtract the value.", 
    "And that value is going\nto be related to the", 
    "square of VI times 5.", 
    "So this is going to\nbe increasing as", 
    "the square of VI.", 
    "And so, therefore, as I subtract\nthat from 10, I&#39;m", 
    "going to get a curve that\nis steeply falling", 
    "and looks like this.", 
    "So this curve is given\nby 10 minus 5, VI", 
    "minus 1 volt squared.", 
    "So that&#39;s the plot of this curve\nfor the dependent source", 
    "circuit that I&#39;ve\njust shown you.", 
    "So this is the VO versus\nVI plot that we", 
    "had set out to discover.",
