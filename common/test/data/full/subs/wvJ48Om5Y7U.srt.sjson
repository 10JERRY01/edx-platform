    "SPEAKER: OK, let's get right down to business.", 
    "So let's start with the amplifier pattern that we", 
    "built using our dependent source.", 
    "And notice here this is my abstract dependent source.", 
    "And I've connected that into my little pattern shown here", 
    "with the resistor RL and going through to supply.", 
    "And my input voltage VI connected to the control port", 
    "of the VCCS.", 
    "OK, so it looks like I need a key device", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "And abstractly, this is the VCCS.", 
    "I need something that looks like this.", 
    "OK, so I need the device to have a control port.", 
    "Let me call it A and D with some voltage v applied to it.", 
    "Then this abstract dependent source would have some current", 
    "going through it.", 
    "And let we call this the B and C terminals", 
    "of the current source.", 
    "And the current would be given by some function of the input", 
    "voltage v. So this is my control port and this is my", 
    "output port.", 
    "So AD is my control port and BC is my output port.", 
    "So I need a device that looks exactly like this.", 
    "And this was a voltage control current source.", 
    "So I need a device that looks like this.", 
    "So far we've dealt with this abstraction.", 
    "So what do I do?", 
    "So this is the device that I need, the VCCS.", 
    "It actually turns out that our old friend the MOSFET, under", 
    "certain conditions, is going to do what we need it to do.", 
    "So let me first look at the MOSFET structurally.", 
    "And let's confirm that it satisfies", 
    "our two-port pattern.", 
    "So this was our MOSFET.", 
    "This was our basic MOSFET here with the gate terminal, the", 
    "drain terminal, and the source terminal.", 
    "Well, this a a three-terminal device.", 
    "It doesn't quite look like this, the VCCS", 
    "four-terminal device.", 
    "So what am I talking about?", 
    "Well, what we are going to do is play a little trick here.", 
    "What I'm going to do is, well, these are going to be my B and", 
    "C ports corresponding to the B and C on the VCCS.", 
    "And then what I'm going to do is play a little trick.", 
    "I'm going to say that I'm going to share my S terminal", 
    "with both the input and the output port.", 
    "And I'm going to call this A and I'm going to call this D.", 
    "So I'm going to say that here's my MOSFET.", 
    "And structurally, I'm going to use it in a way that I'm going", 
    "to share the S terminal with the input, and", 
    "also with the output.", 
    "So I'm going to apply some voltage v between the gate and", 
    "source terminals, and treat that as a port.", 
    "And then I'm going to observe the current that goes through", 
    "from the drain to source terminals of the MOSFET.", 
    "And recall for the MOSFET that the current going into the", 
    "gate, G, is always 0.", 
    "In 6.002x, we always take that as 0.", 
    "In more advanced courses, we'll see the behavior is", 
    "somewhat different.", 
    "But for our purposes, we take that to be 0 for now.", 
    "Let's move on.", 
    "So structurally, the MOSFET satisfies the kind of two-port", 
    "structure that we need.", 
    "But then, let's stare at it some more.", 
    "And what we're going to find is something very funny.", 
    "So first of all, we kind of lied.", 
    "We held back the truth.", 
    "We showed you just a piece of the puzzle.", 
    "So we just showed you a piece of the puzzle and in that", 
    "piece of the puzzle, the MOSFET behaved like a switch.", 
    "So let me draw the MOSFET again.", 
    "So here's my MOSFET, the gate, drain, and source terminals.", 
    "And what I've said is that I want to view the MOSFET as a", 
    "two-port device.", 
    "And I'm going to treat the source terminal, along with", 
    "the gate terminal as a control port.", 
    "And I'm going to treat the drain and the source as an", 
    "output port as well.", 
    "So what you're going to notice here in a few minutes is that", 
    "the on-state behavior of the MOSFET is quite a bit more", 
    "complex than we've seen so far.", 
    "In the past, we looked at a very simple model.", 
    "Oftentimes in physics we say, hey, look, let's assume, make", 
    "the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] approximation to this object.", 
    "Well, similarly, if we took a complex device like the MOSFET", 
    "and say, hey, when it's on, let's pretend it behaves like", 
    "a very simple resistor.", 
    "Then it kind of satisfied our needs for digital circuits.", 
    "It turns out that on-state behavior of the MOSFET is", 
    "quite a bit more complex than I had you believe earlier.", 
    "Let's look at how it really, really looks like and", 
    "reconcile this with what you've seen so far.", 
    "So in its off-state, things are exactly", 
    "as I told you before.", 
    "So here are my ports.", 
    "So this is my D port and my DS port.", 
    "And there it does behave like an open circuit.", 
    "And this is my gate and this is S. So the", 
    "voltage here is VGS.", 
    "And when VGS is less than some threshold voltage VT, then", 
    "this is an open source.", 
    "So this is the case when VGS less than VT.", 
    "The MOSFET is in its off-state.", 
    "The MOSFET is off.", 
    "It behaves like a switch in its off-state and you get an", 
    "open circuit.", 
    "This is my D terminal here.", 
    "So when the switch is in its on-state,", 
    "something different happens.", 
    "So let's take a look at that.", 
    "So when the situation is such that VGS greater than or equal", 
    "to VT, something very, very interesting happens.", 
    "And it's quite a bit different under certain conditions than", 
    "what we saw before.", 
    "Let's go take a look at it.", 
    "So let's look at the behavior of the MOSFET graphically.", 
    "And in order to plot out the curves, let me build up a", 
    "little circuit and look at how it behaves.", 
    "So let me apply a source at the input VGS.", 
    "And let me apply that here to the", 
    "control port of the MOSFET.", 
    "And then, let me apply another voltage source, VDS across the", 
    "control port like so.", 
    "So let me apply VDS and measure iDS.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is apply a VGS at the control", 
    "port between the G and S terminals of the MOSFET.", 
    "So if you want me to draw it that way, I'm happy to do so.", 
    "Plus here, minus here, VGS.", 
    "So I'm going to apply a VGS between the", 
    "gate and the source.", 
    "And I'm going to measure the current iDS that flows between", 
    "the drain and source terminals of the MOSFET when a voltage", 
    "VDS is applied between the drain and source terminals.", 
    "So first, I'm going to start by showing you what you've", 
    "seen so far.", 
    "And really, the MOSFET isn't going to", 
    "change its parts here.", 
    "It's going to behave pretty much like you expected it to", 
    "do in the regimes of operation that I showed you before.", 
    "And so this is the circuit that I'm going to use.", 
    "As I showed you before, VGS between gate and source and", 
    "VDS between drain and source.", 
    "So let's start with the simplest model.", 
    "We saw the S model for the MOSFET.", 
    "And in this S model, when the gate voltage VGS was less than", 
    "VT, the threshold voltage, then the MOSFET behaved like", 
    "an open circuit.", 
    "Was a switch in its off-state, and so this shows it's off.", 
    "However, when VGS was greater than or equal to VT, then the", 
    "MOSFET behaved like a short circuit.", 
    "And so we had a vertical line.", 
    "You'll recall the demonstrations I showed you", 
    "where this line would be true.", 
    "This would be the current through the MOSFET.", 
    "Essentially, the short circuit can hold any", 
    "current at 0 voltage.", 
    "And similarly, when the MOSFET was in its off-state, I could", 
    "apply any voltage, but the current would be 0.", 
    "So we saw this before.", 
    "So this hasn't changed.", 
    "Then we said, well, the MOSFET really doesn't have an ideal", 
    "short circuit here.", 
    "It does have some resistance.", 
    "So in the case where VGS was less than VT, that was still", 
    "the case, it was still an open circuit.", 
    "But we said when VGS was greater than or equal to VT,", 
    "it is not exactly a short circuit.", 
    "Rather, it displayed some small amount of resistance.", 
    "So for the case where VGS was greater than VT, the iDS", 
    "versus VDS curve for the MOSFET--", 
    "in other words, VDS versus iDS for the MOSFET looked like a", 
    "straight line, and had a resistive behavior.", 
    "No surprises here.", 
    "So what we're going to do next is I'm going to show you a", 
    "little demo.", 
    "So far, so good.", 
    "Everything is as we thought.", 
    "What we're going to find out now is the following.", 
    "That in this situation where I had the SR model, I was using", 
    "very small values of VDS.", 
    "So VDS was very small.", 
    "It actually turns out-- we'll see this in a demonstration in", 
    "a few seconds.", 
    "It actually turns out that when I increase VDS, when I", 
    "increase my DS voltage, if I increase this voltage here,", 
    "then you would expect that if this was a true resistor with", 
    "resistance RON, if it has true resistance RON, then this", 
    "would keep going like this.", 
    "It would be a resistor.", 
    "However, what we are going to see is as I increase my VDS,", 
    "my resistance starts to increase.", 
    "And then, amazingly enough, it will saturate out.", 
    "It will begin to look like this.", 
    "So in other words, it does look like a", 
    "resistor when VDS is small.", 
    "But when I increase VDS beyond a point, the current through", 
    "iDS is the current-- the current through the DS", 
    "terminals begins to saturate out and it no longer behaves", 
    "like a resistor.", 
    "In fact, notice that as it saturates out-- you tell me.", 
    "What does this look like?", 
    "For large values of VDS, as VDS becomes large,", 
    "so this is VDS large.", 
    "Notice that the current has saturated out.", 
    "So what does that look like to you?", 
    "Remember, a horizontal line.", 
    "That looks like current source behavior.", 
    "So it is resistive for small values of VDS.", 
    "But for larger values of VDS, it begins to look like a", 
    "current source.", 
    "So let's look at a quick demo and convince ourselves of what", 
    "this looks like in real life.", 
    "And the way I was able to get away with this little trick", 
    "was in the past I was using very small values of VDS.", 
    "And by doing so, I was able to exercise the MOSFET in this", 
    "small regime here where it had resistive behavior.", 
    "However, as I increase VDS, you will notice that it will", 
    "flatten out like this."
