    "SPEAKER 1: So far to this video, particularly towards", 
    "the latter videos in the sequence, I hope I was able to", 
    "convince you that despite all the theory involved in", 
    "differential equations, you should be able to develop the", 
    "facility to look at circuits and very quickly sketch out", 
    "wave forms and so on completely by intuition and", 
    "use the characteristic equation to calculate", 
    "variables like alpha, omega 0, omega d and Q, which", 
    "completely describe the behavior and the dynamics of", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "I have a couple of more videos to go.", 
    "And in this penultimate video I would like to tie up a", 
    "couple of loose ends.", 
    "So far in our series circuit, let me draw it out here for", 
    "you, this is VI.", 
    "So the series circuit, this is L, this is R,", 
    "and this is the capacitor.", 
    "Let me write down C, R, and L. Notice that we computed the", 
    "value of the voltage, the v as a function of time where the", 
    "voltage was the voltage across the capacitor and this was i.", 
    "Now what about other variables?", 
    "What about the voltage across the resistor vR?", 
    "What about the voltage across the inductor vL?", 
    "Of course, I know that this is vI.", 
    "We also have calculated the current I in the past, so you", 
    "know how to do that.", 
    "So how do you go about finding out vR, and vL, and so on?", 
    "These are all pretty straightforward.", 
    "So the voltage across the capacitor is v. We know that i", 
    "is simply C dv/dt.", 
    "What about vR, the voltage across the capacitor?", 
    "Well that is pretty straightforward too because I", 
    "know that i, since this is a series circuit, i must flow", 
    "through each of these elements.", 
    "And so therefore vR is given by simply iR,", 
    "where i is C dv/dt.", 
    "So vR simply becomes RC dv/dt.", 
    "That's the voltage across the resistor, pretty", 
    "straightforward.", 
    "What about the voltage across the inductor?", 
    "Well the voltage across inductor, vL, is simply given", 
    "by L di/dt.", 
    "And I know i is C dv/dt.", 
    "So that is given by C, stick it in there, so", 
    "d by dt of C dv/dt.", 
    "So this is simply LC d squared v by dt squared.", 
    "That is vL.", 
    "I can pretty much find out the other values pretty quickly.", 
    "Notice that I can also find vL.", 
    "If I know vR, v, and vI, I can very quickly find out vL using", 
    "KVL as well.", 
    "So since the sum of the voltages around a loop is 0,", 
    "then I can sum the voltages around the loop and express vL", 
    "in terms of vR, v, and vI.", 
    "So there's many, many different ways of doing it.", 
    "And once you know how to find v, for instance, you can find", 
    "all the other values, the other", 
    "variables, pretty quickly."
