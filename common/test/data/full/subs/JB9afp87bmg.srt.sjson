    "SPEAKER 1: All right, we are now almost ready to make the", 
    "big connection between the sneaky path that we've taken", 
    "and the solution to the problem that", 
    "we set out to find.", 
    "So let's first write down some basic facts.", 
    "So fact one, we found that finding the response to the", 
    "sneaky input was easy.", 
    "In fact, the response to the sneaky input was exactly this.", 
    "So it was vpe raised to j omega t.", 
    "You'll recall I take s as my shorthand", 
    "notation for j omega.", 
    "So the response to vie raised to j omega t was", 
    "really easy to find.", 
    "What is the second fact?", 
    "The second fact was the following that the input that", 
    "I cared about, vi, this is vi cosine omega t.", 
    "How does that relate to the sneaky input?", 
    "Hey, notice the following.", 
    "From the earlier relationship, so from earlier relation, we", 
    "know that e raised to j omega t equals cosine omega t plus j", 
    "sine omega t.", 
    "Given that the earlier relation says that e raised to", 
    "j omega t is cosine omega t plus j sine omega t, then vi", 
    "cosine omega t can be written as the real part of vie raised", 
    "to j omega t.", 
    "This is not a surprise.", 
    "So if e raised to j omega t is cosine plus j sine, the real", 
    "part of that will simply be vi cosine, again, which is", 
    "exactly what we have here.", 
    "So the real part of vie raised to j omega t is vi", 
    "cosine omega t.", 
    "And so this is the real part of the sneaky input, the real", 
    "part of the sneaky input.", 
    "Let me just write that down as my sneaky input.", 
    "So first fact, finding the response to the", 
    "sneaky input was easy.", 
    "Second fact was that the real input, the actual input vi, is", 
    "the real part of the sneaky input, two facts.", 
    "So let's see how we can use these facts to", 
    "get to what we want.", 
    "So let's write this down in a little table.", 
    "So here's my vi.", 
    "And the response to vi is my particular input vp.", 
    "vis was my sneaky input.", 
    "And the response to the sneaky input was my vps.", 
    "Now, based on the first fact, vi is the real part of vis.", 
    "So do you see a pattern here?", 
    "So vp was the response to vi.", 
    "And really, really what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to", 
    "figure out what this is.", 
    "That's what I want to find out.", 
    "But what I managed to find out was I apply the sneaky input", 
    "and I found out vps.", 
    "So I know vps.", 
    "I found out vps very easily from my sneaky input vis.", 
    "I also know that vi is the real part of my sneaky input.", 
    "So if you want to hit the pause button here and think", 
    "for yourself as to how you can get vp from what we have so", 
    "far, go ahead and do so.", 
    "And then unpause me and I'll give you the answer.", 
    "So let's take a look.", 
    "So any light bulbs going there?", 
    "Let me draw one and see if, here's a light bulb.", 
    "So any brilliant ideas?", 
    "Well, let me go ahead and give you the idea.", 
    "So I am going to use an inverse", 
    "superposition argument.", 
    "Of course, I'm going to assume that the system", 
    "is linear and real.", 
    "So if I have a real input, I'm going to get a real output.", 
    "The j terms are not going to appear", 
    "magically from a real system.", 
    "And I'm also going to assume that the system is linear.", 
    "So the system is linear.", 
    "And the system is real.", 
    "So a real input produces a real output.", 
    "And it's a linear system.", 
    "So here is my inverse superposition argument.", 
    "So what I'm going to say is, if in this linear real system,", 
    "if I can obtain the real input that I care about by taking", 
    "the real part of the sneaky input, then it must be the", 
    "case that, if I take the output of the sneaky input,", 
    "then I can obtain the output that I care about by taking", 
    "the corresponding real part.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "That is the idea.", 
    "In summary, what have I done here?", 
    "What I've said is that in this inverse superposition", 
    "argument, I'm saying in this real linear system, if I apply", 
    "an input vis and obtain an output vps, then, if what I", 
    "really cared about was the real input vi, which was the", 
    "real part of vis, then what I could do was find the output", 
    "to my sneaky input and then obtain the output I really", 
    "cared about by simply taking the real part.", 
    "In other words, take the real part of the input to get the", 
    "real input.", 
    "Similarly, take the real part of the sneaky output to get", 
    "the real output.", 
    "So this was sneaky.", 
    "This was the sneaky part.", 
    "This was a sneaky part.", 
    "So I apply real to both the input and to the output.", 
    "And therefore, I would get the real part of the output", 
    "corresponding to my real input.", 
    "So there you have it.", 
    "So that's the basic idea.", 
    "So I take a input, in this case, vie raised to j omega t,", 
    "and then finding vps was easy.", 
    "And then I said I'll take the real part of that", 
    "easy to find output.", 
    "And then I'm going to get vp.", 
    "That was pretty easy to do.", 
    "Let me go ahead and complete this thing for you.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "I've summarized a few things for you, which is notice that", 
    "the real part of the sneaky input, the real part of the", 
    "sneaky input, is my real input.", 
    "And so therefore, I should be able to get the real output by", 
    "taking the real part of the sneaky output in this inverse", 
    "superposition argument.", 
    "So let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So vp, which is what I cared about, it's the real", 
    "particular response that I care about.", 
    "So this is going to be the real part of my sneaky output.", 
    "So notice that this was complex.", 
    "This was a complex number.", 
    "So I take the real part of that.", 
    "And that should give me what I need.", 
    "And the vps was given by vpe raised to j omega t.", 
    "And from this part here, vp was given by, so real part of", 
    "vp was given by vi divide by 1 plus j omega RC times e", 
    "to the j omega t.", 
    "So this piece here is vp.", 
    "So this piece here is vp.", 
    "And let me draw that nice little trapezoid here just to", 
    "clearly mark that vp again.", 
    "So this is the same vp as shown here.", 
    "So what I'm going to do next is give you a little exercise.", 
    "So I want to pause here and hit the next button so you can", 
    "go to the next exercise.", 
    "And in the next exercise, I would like you to work with", 
    "this expression here.", 
    "I would like you to work with this entire expression inside", 
    "the brackets here.", 
    "And I want you to find out the magnitude and phase of the", 
    "expressions in the bracket and get some practice with the", 
    "complex numbers.", 
    "Then we will come back here.", 
    "And I will find out vp for you.", 
    "So why don't you go ahead and try it out in the exercise?", 
    "And then I'll see you back in a few minutes."
