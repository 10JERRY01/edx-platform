    "SPEAKER: So notice that this is the VDS--", 
    "I'm sorry, VDS axis.", 
    "This is the iDs axis.", 
    "And I'm plotting iDS versus VDS.", 
    "And when VGS, the gate voltage is more than a threshold.", 
    "Notice that I see what looks like something, more or less", 
    "like a straight line.", 
    "And this is a straight line with some slope.", 
    "More or less a straight line, implying resistive behavior.", 
    "And then we also had some fun and games here.", 
    "We said, hey, what if I turn VGS off.", 
    "Boom.", 
    "OK, that would be my iDS of 0, implying that the MOSFET", 
    "behaved like an open circuit between the", 
    "drain and the source.", 
    "I applied a positive VGS, more than VT and then begin to look", 
    "like a resistor.", 
    "Open circuit resistor.", 
    "Open circuit resistor.", 
    "OK, after now, nothing new.", 
    "So you shouldn't have learned anything at all that's new", 
    "until now, in today's lecture.", 
    "OK, now watch.", 
    "What I'm going to do is, as I said, I kind of", 
    "lied all this time.", 
    "And I just showed you this behavior.", 
    "And what I've been doing all along is very carefully using", 
    "a very small value of VDS.", 
    "Notice it's small values of VDS.", 
    "I haven't told you what it looks like as VDS increases.", 
    "Well, let's go try it out.", 
    "We have a scope here.", 
    "We have the MOSFET here.", 
    "Now, I'm not sure what's going to happen now.", 
    "You may see smoke.", 
    "We have an explosion.", 
    "Who knows what?", 
    "Just look up there for a second.", 
    "So I increase VDS.", 
    "Whoa, what a lie.", 
    "Agarwal's a liar.", 
    "So I've been kind of tricking you.", 
    "I've been covering up all the part here and showing you just", 
    "this region of the curve for small values of VDS.", 
    "But as I increase VDS, this is nothing that looks even close", 
    "to that of resistive behavior.", 
    "OK, so what's happening here?"
