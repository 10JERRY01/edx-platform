    "SPEAKER 1: You've just had your final lecture before we", 
    "hit capacitors and inductors, which are about to come up.", 
    "There are rather exciting elements which we've been sort", 
    "of preparing you for the past few lectures.", 
    "And this is the first time you're going to see", 
    "differential equations.", 
    "And differential equations are a really interesting object", 
    "and they're a way of understanding dynamic systems.", 
    "JERRY: Yes, indeed.", 
    "They were invented by Sir Isaac Newton about 370 years", 
    "ago for the purpose of describing how things move,", 
    "given that you know where they are.", 
    "We ought to be able to predict the future, given the present.", 
    "And so I'll explain that.", 
    "In the case of a very simple circuit here, we'll do an R", 
    "and a C and set it up like this.", 
    "And we're going to give this a drive, so there's going", 
    "to be a VI of t.", 
    "And we're going to measure the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor V of t.", 
    "And I want to know what that is, given that I know the", 
    "value of v at some time--", 
    "let's call it 0.", 
    "Suppose we have the value at some initial time, and we have", 
    "some circuit like this.", 
    "Well, one of the things I can do--", 
    "I'm not going to do the algebra, it's easy, except for", 
    "the fact that we know that the current through the capacitor", 
    "i equals C times dv dt.", 
    "And so from that, I get a differential equation here,", 
    "which is RC dv of t dt plus v of t equals the VI of t.", 
    "So what this says is, it's relating the slope of V at any", 
    "moment to the value of the voltage across the capacitor", 
    "at that moment, and the drive at that moment.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So the place Jerry got this equation was just by", 
    "doing nodal analysis on this, but that nodal analysis had", 
    "this formula i equals C dv dt, so he had to", 
    "pug that in in there.", 
    "So this is just nodal analysis.", 
    "JERRY: Right.", 
    "And so now from this, I can isolate dv dt.", 
    "I can write dv of t dt is VI of t minus V of", 
    "t divided by RC.", 
    "And the reason I'm doing that is because I want to show you", 
    "how this predicts the future.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Just to quickly point out, you can't do this", 
    "for all differential equations.", 
    "In many cases, you're going to have, for example, dv of t dt,", 
    "plus, for example, d squared v dt squared, and so on and so", 
    "forth, and it gets messy.", 
    "JERRY: Except that actually, it's all the cases where it", 
    "makes sense, you can do something like this, which", 
    "I'll explain in some other, later time.", 
    "So look.", 
    "Supposing I have a graph in time.", 
    "Here is time, and here is the v that we're looking for.", 
    "And also, on the same time axis, I have the", 
    "drive capital VI.", 
    "And let's have a function that does something.", 
    "I don't care what it does right now.", 
    "Now I know v of 0, so I know some point.", 
    "Given that I know this value, I can compute from this little", 
    "formula here the slope, dv I of t, dv of t at 0.", 
    "But given that I have that slope, that means I can", 
    "predict the future.", 
    "I can say, well, that's the next possible time.", 
    "I can look at that, oh, now I have to", 
    "exactly the same situation.", 
    "At the next time, I can say, well, now I know the input,", 
    "the drive, and I know the value of v, and therefore I", 
    "can plug it in here, I compute the slope, and", 
    "go to the next place.", 
    "And so I can essentially walk the future from the present.", 
    "Now, I'd have to do this arbitrarily tightly to get a", 
    "really accurate answer, but that's what the differential", 
    "equation means.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And over the next lecture, you'll see a way to", 
    "apply this to simple RL/C circuits and how to solve", 
    "these equations, and after that, later, you'll see", 
    "slightly more complex ones, and nice tricks for solving", 
    "them in fairly easy ways."
