    "SPEAKER 1: Well, the theory of the small signal method and", 
    "amplifiers is great.", 
    "The question that keeps popping up is, how do you go", 
    "about choosing the bias point or the operating point?", 
    "So we know that once you choose an operating point, you", 
    "can find out the small signal output based on a", 
    "small signal input.", 
    "But the question we ask ourselves is, how do you", 
    "choose the bias point?", 
    "So given your transfer function here, where do I", 
    "actually go and pick my DC offsets?", 
    "What are the various factors that affect my choice of", 
    "operating point?", 
    "So in this little figure here, notice that this is where I", 
    "had the old operating point.", 
    "A few minutes ago, I talked about a given operating point,", 
    "and this was my previous operating point.", 
    "In this little diagram, I want to pick a new operating point.", 
    "I'm going to pick this one.", 
    "And I'm going to call this my new operating point, just for", 
    "fun and to show you how things look different.", 
    "Again, it's completely under my control as to where I pick", 
    "my operating point.", 
    "I can pick it anywhere between these two points, which is the", 
    "saturation region of my amplifier curve.", 
    "That's a region where the MOSFET will be in saturation.", 
    "And this is vI here.", 
    "Let me just make a quick note there.", 
    "OK, so this time around, I've picked this", 
    "point as my bias point.", 
    "Now given that I've picked that as my bias point, I can", 
    "apply an input voltage, a small voltage vi about that", 
    "bias point.", 
    "And then, I get a corresponding output voltage,", 
    "v0, that corresponds to this new bias point.", 
    "The question to ask ourselves is, how do we go about", 
    "choosing a bias point?", 
    "Is this a better bias point?", 
    "Or Is this a better bias point?", 
    "But more fundamentally, what are the constraints, what are", 
    "the factors I should consider in choosing a bias point?", 
    "One factor is pretty obvious right away.", 
    "If you look at this figure here, if I choose this as my", 
    "vi offset, as my vi input bias point, then notice that the", 
    "maximum value that vi can go to--", 
    "the maximum excursion in the positive Vi direction--", 
    "is this.", 
    "So this is the maximum range of operation", 
    "for vi on the upside.", 
    "However, given this operating point, notice that for", 
    "negative excursions of vi, I can go all the way to here.", 
    "So notice that if I were to redraw this here, on the", 
    "positive side for vi, I can have excursions", 
    "that look like this.", 
    "And on the negative side, notice that I can have much", 
    "larger excursions for vi.", 
    "So right there, this fact should begin to give you a", 
    "clue as to at least one factor that can help you choose an", 
    "appropriate bias point.", 
    "OK, let's look at that in some more detail.", 
    "The first thing to keep in mind is that if", 
    "you want equal swing--", 
    "in this case, my vi can swing a small distance in the", 
    "positive direction and a much larger distance in the", 
    "negative direction, all the way up to VT.", 
    "And so clearly, if I have a symmetric voltage, symmetric", 
    "about the positive and negative axis, which is pretty", 
    "common, then the best I can do would be some signal that", 
    "looks like this, OK?", 
    "If I want a symmetric signal, then I'm going to have a", 
    "roughly symmetric swing about this operating point.", 
    "So I'm really [? wasting ?] this region, which", 
    "may be quite OK.", 
    "However, if I want a symmetric swing, then it may behoove me", 
    "to pick an operating point.", 
    "So if I look at this region here--", 
    "this is the valid region of operation.", 
    "So if I want a symmetric swing, I might want to pick an", 
    "operating point right in the middle for", 
    "symmetric input swing.", 
    "Notice that the case would be a little different for the", 
    "output, and we will consider that in a few seconds.", 
    "If I exercise the entire region of the output curve,", 
    "then notice that I do get some distortion.", 
    "And so I won't get a symmetric swing on the output.", 
    "However, at least at the input, I'm going to get a", 
    "symmetric swing for the input if I choose the midpoint of", 
    "the input operating range.", 
    "So the midpoint of the input operating range tends to be a", 
    "common place where you might bias a circuit.", 
    "But let's go and look at this in more detail, and look at", 
    "what other factors might be in play as I go", 
    "ahead and pick my swing.", 
    "OK, so let's take a look at this little equation here.", 
    "And before I go ahead and describe that, let me just", 
    "write down the value of the v0 for you as", 
    "a function of small.", 
    "So here is my little v0.", 
    "So my little v0 relates to my input excursion Vvi the input", 
    "voltage Vi, the small signal.", 
    "And it relates to minus k Vi minus Vt times RL.", 
    "Sorry for the little mess that I made here.", 
    "OK, so v0 equals minus k times Vi minus Vt times RL vi.", 
    "So that is how the small signal voltage relates to the", 
    "small signal output.", 
    "All right, now let's take a look--", 
    "do you know what?", 
    "Let me just write this more cleanly here.", 
    "So v0 equals minus k, Vi minus Vt times RL times small vi,", 
    "where K Vi minus Vt is gm.", 
    "OK, so now let's take a look at how we might go ahead and", 
    "choose the bias point.", 
    "So the way I'm going to do this is by superimposing the", 
    "load line on top of the device characteristics as shown here.", 
    "So recall that these are the device", 
    "characteristics for the MOSFET.", 
    "And those establish one set of constraints on the operation.", 
    "And so this little curve here is given by iDS.", 
    "Once constraint here is that iDs must be less than k by 2", 
    "v0 squared.", 
    "OK, that's one set of constraints.", 
    "Then, I had a load line that corresponded to my second set", 
    "of constraints.", 
    "And you've seen this before, so all of this should not be", 
    "new to you.", 
    "So this is my load line.", 
    "And the load line equation is given by-- and again, you've", 
    "seen this before--", 
    "iDs equals VS divided RL minus v0 divided by RL.", 
    "So one way to find the output response was to look at these", 
    "two constraints.", 
    "So at any given point in time, the output had to", 
    "follow the load line.", 
    "The output point could not be anywhere else.", 
    "It had to follow the bias point.", 
    "It had to follow the load line.", 
    "So for example, I could pick this as my bias point.", 
    "Let me change colors just so it's easier to follow.", 
    "So this could be a bias point.", 
    "So if I pick that as my bias point-- so for example, let me", 
    "call it my example bias point.", 
    "If I pick that as my example bias point, and let", 
    "me call that VI.", 
    "So this is where Vgs R equals VI, in this case increases.", 
    "So that's my VI.", 
    "And then my corresponding v0 is here.", 
    "That's my corresponding v0.", 
    "And then recall that my constraints where VI was equal", 
    "to VT at this point where the MOSFET went into cut off.", 
    "And then my second constraint was here, and this was a", 
    "solution to the quadratic that we had to do.", 
    "And we had done that earlier as well.", 
    "I won't go and rewrite that part.", 
    "So as long as I operate in this region of the curve", 
    "between here and here, I will be operating the MOSFET in", 
    "saturation.", 
    "So what I can do is if I pick this operating point, then for", 
    "excursions of VI about this point-- so let's say I have", 
    "excursions of VI about that point--", 
    "then my output would be given by this range of operation.", 
    "So that range would govern how the output signal would", 
    "respond to the input.", 
    "OK, so for instance if my input were to change from here", 
    "to here, then my output would change from here to here.", 
    "So there would be some response here that would be", 
    "related to my input changing."
