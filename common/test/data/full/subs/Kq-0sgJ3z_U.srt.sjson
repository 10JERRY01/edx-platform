    "SPEAKER 1: Next, let's try to understand how we can go about", 
    "designing filters.", 
    "So if you have some signal coming at us, and let's say I", 
    "want to eliminate some frequency", 
    "component of the signal.", 
    "So for example, one thing that you see commonly in a lot of", 
    "appliances is filters that eliminate the", 
    "50 or 60 hertz signal.", 
    "So because our AC current in most countries is at 50 hertz", 
    "or 60 hertz, that 50 or 60 hertz signal tends to get", 
    "mixed up with a lot of other signals of interest to us.", 
    "And so we often build special circuits to eliminate that", 
    "specific frequency from the signal.", 
    "Otherwise we end up with a very low hum.", 
    "And what we're going to do here is try to build a variety", 
    "of filters.", 
    "And I'm going to start by giving you some insight in", 
    "terms of how you can build these filters.", 
    "So here's what I recommend we do.", 
    "So let me say I want to plot, as a functional frequency, the", 
    "impedance or some circuit.", 
    "So let's say I have some of the components.", 
    "It could be a series combination, parallel", 
    "combination, or some circuit with two ends exposed.", 
    "So let's say the net impedance contained inside is Z. So it", 
    "could be a resistor.", 
    "So for example it might be a resistor, inductor.", 
    "Or it might be a inductor, capacitor, resistor.", 
    "It could be a resistor in parallel with a", 
    "capacitor or whatever.", 
    "It is some circuit containing a bunch of impedances.", 
    "And a pair of terminals are visible.", 
    "And so there's some impedance that I can measure between", 
    "that terminal pair.", 
    "So let's see how I can go ahead and build filters by", 
    "combining impedances.", 
    "So suppose I have just a capacitor.", 
    "So suppose my Z is just a good old capacitor.", 
    "So how does impedance of the capacitor change?", 
    "Well we know this.", 
    "For very low frequencies, the impedance of the capacitor is", 
    "very, very high.", 
    "The capacitor looks like an open circuit.", 
    "But for very high frequencies, the capacitor looks like a", 
    "short circuit.", 
    "So for the capacitor here is the curve", 
    "that shows its impedance.", 
    "This is for the capacitor.", 
    "Not surprisingly, it's impedance is given by j omega", 
    "C. So for very small values of C, the impedance is high, and", 
    "for large values of C, the impedance is very low.", 
    "Remember this.", 
    "So capacitors appear as short circuits for high frequency", 
    "signals and appear as open circuits for", 
    "low frequency signals.", 
    "That's a capacitor.", 
    "What about the resistor?", 
    "Let me change colors here and let me pick", 
    "green for my resistor.", 
    "So for the resistor, if I have a resistor R, notice that its", 
    "behavior is frequency independent.", 
    "So its impedance is simply R. And so it is", 
    "going to be a constant.", 
    "So this is R.", 
    "Let me just change colors here back to red.", 
    "That didn't work.", 
    "So for the capacitor, the impedance is 1 over j omega C.", 
    "For the capacitor, the impedance ZR is simply R.", 
    "Next, let's see what the inductor looks like.", 
    "Let me switch to blue.", 
    "So for the inductor, recall that ZL for the inductor is j", 
    "omega L. So the magnitude of the impedance ZL is simply", 
    "omega L. The magnitude of j is 1 so the magnitude of the", 
    "impedance of the inductor is omega L. So the inductor looks", 
    "like a straight line like so.", 
    "This is for the inductor.", 
    "So ZL is j omega L and magnitude of ZL is simply", 
    "omega L.", 
    "So for the inductor, notice that's a very low values of", 
    "omega, the inductance is very low, and for high values of", 
    "omega, the inductance is very high.", 
    "Not surprisingly, the inductor looks like an open circuit to", 
    "high frequencies and that DC and very low frequencies, the", 
    "inductor looks very much like a short circuit.", 
    "OK, so not surprising at all.", 
    "This is something you've seen before.", 
    "So let's use this insight to build filters by combining", 
    "resistors, inductors, and capacitors.", 
    "OK, so I've just drawn the behavior of inductors,", 
    "capacitors, and resistors to frequency on the", 
    "right-hand side here.", 
    "So let's look at what filters might look like.", 
    "So let's start with something like this.", 
    "So let's say I give you a circuit that looks like this.", 
    "OK, it's a capacitor resistor circuit, some capacitance C,", 
    "some resistance R. And in this case, I take the", 
    "output across here.", 
    "So that's at this is Vi, this is Vr, and I take H of omega", 
    "to be Vr divided by Vi.", 
    "So what does that look like, the function of omega?", 
    "So if I plot the magnitude of H of omega of the transfer", 
    "function for this filter, what does it look like?", 
    "I would encourage you to hit the pause button and think of", 
    "what the transfer function, the frequency response, looks", 
    "like this before I tell you the answer myself.", 
    "All right, so let's understand this.", 
    "So let's start with the high frequencies just for fun.", 
    "For very high frequencies, note that the capacitor is a", 
    "short circuit.", 
    "And the resistor, of course, has a resistance R. So the", 
    "capacitor is a short circuit and so Vi will", 
    "appear directly at Vr.", 
    "So for very high frequencies, my filter will", 
    "give me Vi at Vr.", 
    "So Vr divided by Vi will simply be unity.", 
    "What about for very low frequencies?", 
    "At very low frequencies, the capacitor behaves", 
    "like an open circuit.", 
    "OK, so this behaves like an open circuit.", 
    "And if that behaves like an open circuit, then most of the", 
    "voltage drop will be across the capacitor and very little", 
    "will drop across the resistor and so I'm going to", 
    "get a very low value.", 
    "So low value for low frequencies and high values", 
    "for high frequencies.", 
    "And this is what I end up with.", 
    "So this is a really, really good way to do things, to look", 
    "at low frequencies and high frequencies.", 
    "And in this case, notice that if I have a capacitor up here", 
    "and across the resistor is where I take my output Vr,", 
    "then I end up with a response that looks like this.", 
    "So what is this?", 
    "In this case, it passes high frequencies.", 
    "So this is called a high pass filter, or HPF.", 
    "Let's build the next circuit.", 
    "Let me switch colors for fun.", 
    "Let me go to green.", 
    "OK, so let's do something simple,", 
    "something you've seen before.", 
    "So let's start with just a simple RC circuit like this.", 
    "In this case I'm going to measure the", 
    "voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "OK, so if this is VC, this Vi, then H of omega is", 
    "VC divided by Vi.", 
    "So I can plot the response for this circuit as", 
    "a function of omega.", 
    "And I plot the magnitude of H of omega.", 
    "So what does this look like?", 
    "You saw this before a few seconds ago.", 
    "For low frequencies, the capacitor behaves", 
    "like an open surface.", 
    "So all the voltage drops across it.", 
    "For high frequencies it behaves like a short circuit,", 
    "so very low voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "And I join these two up.", 
    "And I remember this was my low pass filter, or LPF.", 
    "Let me switch colors again.", 
    "And this time around let me go to red.", 
    "So let me build you another little circuit.", 
    "Let's say I give you something that looks like this.", 
    "So Vi is my input.", 
    "Why don't I have a resistor and I stick an inductor here.", 
    "So this time around, I take the voltage", 
    "VL across the inductor.", 
    "And my H of omega here is VL divided by Vi.", 
    "So what does that look like?", 
    "So that's omega and let me plot the magnitude of H of", 
    "omega and see if you can tell me what kind of", 
    "a filter that is.", 
    "You may want to hit the pause button and figure out the type", 
    "of filter yourselves before I go and draw it for you.", 
    "OK, let me do this.", 
    "So this case, what happens at low frequencies?", 
    "Well at low frequencies the inductor behaves", 
    "like a short circuit.", 
    "The inductor behaves like a short circuit, so very low", 
    "voltage dropped across it, and so I'm going to get a low", 
    "value for H of omega, magnitude.", 
    "For very high frequencies, the inductor behaves", 
    "like an open circuit.", 
    "And so therefore, most of Vi drops across the inductor and", 
    "I get the same input appearing at the output for very high", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "And then I join the two up.", 
    "So I just discovered that this is another way of building a", 
    "high pass filter.", 
    "So this is a high pass filter, for HPF.", 
    "So notice I can build a high pass filter with a resistor", 
    "and inductor by taking the voltage across the inductor or", 
    "I can also build it using a capacitive circuit by taking", 
    "the voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "In the next exercise, we will give you another circuit and", 
    "have you figure out what the filter looks like by", 
    "yourselves."
