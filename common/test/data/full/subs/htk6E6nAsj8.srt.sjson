    "SPEAKER: All right, so now that\nwe&#39;ve convinced ourselves", 
    "that amplifiers are generally a\ngood thing to have. They&#39;re", 
    "useful in both the analog domain\nand amplification is", 
    "good in the digital\ndomain as well.", 
    "Let&#39;s now look to see what an\namplifier really looks like", 
    "and how we might build one\nbased on some of the", 
    "components that we&#39;ve\nseen so far.", 
    "So before I do that, let me play\naround with the amplifier", 
    "abstraction, the amplifier\nbox a little bit.", 
    "And then we can go into\ntrying to build one.", 
    "So am amplifier is really\na three-ported device.", 
    "Previously in the very abstract\nnotion, I showed you", 
    "an amplifier looking like this\nwith an input and an output", 
    "where some wave form\nof the input was", 
    "amplified at the output.", 
    "An amplifier is really a\nthree-ported device, has three", 
    "pairs of terminals.", 
    "And there is the input port.", 
    "It has an output port.", 
    "And there is a power port.", 
    "One of the key things that\namplifiers do is they provide", 
    "power amplification.", 
    "In other words, you can\nhave an amplifier", 
    "that amplifies voltage.", 
    "But oftentimes, we need to\namplify power to get something", 
    "useful out the amplifier.", 
    "And so in this case, you look\nat the power going in.", 
    "So for example, if I have a vI\nat the input and a iI at the", 
    "input, then the power\nis given by vi iI.", 
    "And then I have a\noutput port vo.", 
    "And I write that down as io.", 
    "There is some power\nprovided by the", 
    "amplifier at the output.", 
    "That power relates\nto vo and io.", 
    "And so this amplifier provides\npower gain if the power", 
    "provided at the output of the\namplifier is greater than the", 
    "power that is consumed by the\namplifier at the input.", 
    "So in situations like this where\nit&#39;s amplifying power,", 
    "the power must come\nfrom somewhere.", 
    "And usually what happens is that\nthere&#39;s a power port and", 
    "there&#39;s a power supply\nconnection where power is", 
    "input to the amplifier.", 
    "So this is my amplifier\nabstraction.", 
    "Now, commonly we could\nhave amplifiers", 
    "that look like this.", 
    "But commonly we draw\nan amplifier in", 
    "the following manner.", 
    "We make some connections\nas follow.", 
    "So I have my input and output\nports as usual.", 
    "So let me draw my input\nand output ports.", 
    "Very common we will take one\nof the ports as ground.", 
    "So we have a common ground for\nboth the input and the output.", 
    "And then for the power port in\nthe same manner, we would", 
    "commonly have a ground\nconnection and I would have a", 
    "power connection up here.", 
    "So I would have a power\nconnection with respect to", 
    "ground, we have an input with\nrespect to ground, and a taken", 
    "output with respect to ground.", 
    "So this is another common\nconnection for my amplifier.", 
    "Now, very, very commonly, we\nwould not end up showing the", 
    "power port.", 
    "So this part here and this\npart here are very", 
    "commonly not shown.", 
    "Also for convenience, as I said,\nwe observe the common", 
    "ground discipline, which is\nproviding a common ground", 
    "connection for the amplifier,\nboth at the", 
    "input and the output.", 
    "So the reference ground it\ntaken to be the same.", 
    "Now in many amplifiers,\nthis may not be true.", 
    "There&#39;s one class of amplifiers\ncalled differential", 
    "amplifiers.", 
    "And in differential amplifiers,\nI don&#39;t take a", 
    "ground at--", 
    "one of my pair of input\nterminals is not a ground", 
    "connection.", 
    "I take a differential signal.", 
    "We&#39;ll see some of these later\non in the course.", 
    "While the output may have\na ground connection.", 
    "But by and large, while there\nare exceptions, these are", 
    "commonly adopted principles.", 
    "That&#39;s enough for abstract\namplifier devices.", 
    "And so the question for\nourselves is, how do we build", 
    "ourselves an amplifier?", 
    "You&#39;ve seen a bunch of devices\nand elements so far--", 
    "resistors, and dependent\nsources, and independent", 
    "sources, and so on.", 
    "How do we build ourselves\nan amplifier?", 
    "So what we&#39;re looking to do\nis going to look inside an", 
    "amplifier and see, how\ndo we build an", 
    "amplifier on the inside?", 
    "What are the components and\nhow are those components", 
    "connected inside\nthe amplifier?", 
    "But notice that once we build\nourselves an amplifier, then", 
    "commonly we will just take a box\nlike this and be able to", 
    "build circuits by connecting\nsuch boxes together.", 
    "We will build abstract devices\ncalled an amplifier.", 
    "And so for now, let&#39;s go in and\nlook inside and see, how", 
    "do we build ourselves\nan amplifier?", 
    "OK, so surprises, surprises.", 
    "You already built\nan amplifier.", 
    "I&#39;m trying to think back\non where you might", 
    "have built an amplifier.", 
    "But here&#39;s where.", 
    "So you&#39;ll recall this little\ndependent source circuit that", 
    "I showed you earlier,\nwhere you had a", 
    "dependent current source.", 
    "Where the current was given by\niD is K divided by 2 times vn", 
    "minus 1 all squared\nfor vn greater", 
    "than 1, and 0 otherwise.", 
    "And we had an input vi source.", 
    "And so this was a little circuit\nwe looked at before.", 
    "I claimed that this\nwas an amplifier.", 
    "Let&#39;s try to understand this.", 
    "So before I try to justify\nthe claim that this is an", 
    "amplifier, let me just refresh\nyour memory in terms of the", 
    "basic equation that we\nhad for this circuit.", 
    "So recall we applied\nthe node method.", 
    "And by the node method, we\ncomputed the relationship", 
    "between v0 and vi.", 
    "So so we had a connection\nbetween v0 and vi here.", 
    "And we did that by applying the\nnode equation to the node", 
    "with the voltage v0.", 
    "And so I summed the currents\nto 0 out here, and then I", 
    "rearranged my terms here.", 
    "I substituted for iD out here\nand that&#39;s how I got my v0", 
    "equals some function, some vs\nminus Ky 2 Vi minus 1 all", 
    "squared times RL.", 
    "So I got my v0 as a\nfunction of vI.", 
    "So we&#39;ve seen all\nof this before.", 
    "So my claim is that this\nis an amplifier.", 
    "So let&#39;s go and take a look at\nit and see if we can convince", 
    "ourselves that what we\nhave is an amplifier.", 
    "In that, if I could create a\ndependent source with the", 
    "following property, then by\nusing this connection I could", 
    "build myself an amplifier.", 
    "And again, remember, I haven&#39;t\nshown you how to build a", 
    "dependent source.", 
    "So the dependent source itself\nis a question mark.", 
    "But suppose you had an abstract\ndependent source", 
    "device that looked like this.", 
    "Then I&#39;m going to first convince\nyou that you could", 
    "build an amplifier using\nthis connection.", 
    "So let&#39;s keep this in mind.", 
    "Let&#39;s put a star on this\nequation and keep it in mind,", 
    "and then go and look at equation\nin more detail to see", 
    "if we, indeed, have some\namplification.",
