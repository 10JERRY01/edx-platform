    "SPEAKER 1: Well, we really can\nvary across an element and the", 
    "current doesn&#39;t change through\nit and the current is 0, then", 
    "that&#39;s an open circuit.", 
    "So in this case, it behaves\nlike a resistor.", 
    "And in this case, the device\nbehaved like an open circuit.", 
    null, 
    "So continuing with the example,\nsupposing I build a", 
    "little circuit that looks\nlike this with", 
    "a voltage and resistor.", 
    "This is my usual\nThevenin trick.", 
    "And if I go ahead and build\nthis for you, let&#39;s take a", 
    "quick look at how would I go\nand solve the circuit if I", 
    "replaced my non-linear device\nwith a linear approximation", 
    "where the linear approximation\nis an open circuit on the", 
    "left-hand side and then\na resistor on", 
    "the right-hand side.", 
    "Supposing I am told that\nv is positive.", 
    "So what I&#39;m trying to do here is\nfigure out what the circuit", 
    "that I&#39;ve shown you here, for\nthis circuit, I&#39;m trying to", 
    "figure out which of these two\nelements apply, whether it&#39;s", 
    "Region A or Region B.", 
    "Now, supposing we are given\nthat V is positive.", 
    "If V is positive, what\ndoes that mean?", 
    "If V is positive, notice that\nI have two segments here.", 
    "One of them as an\nopen circuit.", 
    "One of them is a resistor.", 
    "So in this case, if I&#39;m given\nthat V is positive, then I&#39;m", 
    "going to have a positive\nvoltage here.", 
    "And if I&#39;m a positive voltage\nhere, then I&#39;m going to be in", 
    "the right-hand part of this\nfigure, and so Linear Region B", 
    "will apply.", 
    "So if V is positive, then D will\noperate in Linear Region", 
    "B. So if D operates in Linear\nRegion B, then I can replace D", 
    "in the circuit with the\nresistance of value 1 by R", 
    "when D operates in Linear Region\nB. Let me just make it", 
    "1 by RD to distinguish it from\nthe other resistance.", 
    "So if the slope of this line\nhere is 1 divided by RD, then", 
    "I can replace the device with\na resistance 1 divided by RD", 
    "for the purposes of calculating\nparameters as", 
    "related to the circuit when\nD operates in this region.", 
    "So what that means is that in\nRegion B, my equivalence", 
    "circuit will look like this.", 
    "My voltage source is usual at\nthe resistance R, and then I", 
    "have a resistance at\nthis point RD.", 
    "So this is VD, and\nthis says iD.", 
    "So what that says if the source\nvoltage V is positive,", 
    "then my non-linear device will\noperate in Linear Region B", 
    "when it works like a resistor\nwith resistance RD, so I can", 
    "replace a non-linear device\nwith the resistance RD.", 
    "Now, it generally is quite a\ntrick to figure out what is", 
    "the right approximations\nto make when you have", 
    "circuits like this.", 
    "So that is somewhat\nof an art form.", 
    "So practice certainly\nhelps with that.", 
    "But you may also have a\npiecewise linear device to", 
    "begin with.", 
    "Somebody invents a new device\nthat has some characteristic", 
    "that, for instance,\nlooks like this.", 
    "So this device is piecewise\nlinear.", 
    "This is vD and this is iD And if\nthis device has a piecewise", 
    "linear relationship like that,\nthen that may be a set of", 
    "device properties that comes\nfrom the device itself and not", 
    "from any approximation.", 
    "Either way, whether the device\nthat you&#39;re given, itself, is", 
    "a piecewise linear device,\nor whether you&#39;ve taken a", 
    "non-linear curve, for example,\nsome non-linear curve that", 
    "looks like this.", 
    "And if I replace that curve\nwith it piecewise linear", 
    "function that looks like this,\nthen I can go ahead and use", 
    "those regions and go and\nsolve my circuit.", 
    "And as before, I have to first\nfigure out in which region the", 
    "device is operating for a given\nset of values of the", 
    "other parameters\nin the circuit.", 
    "And then I can go and replace\nthat device with the", 
    "appropriate resistance value.", 
    "So for example, if I had this\ndevice, then this is one", 
    "resistance RA, and this is some\nother resistance, RB.", 
    "So I would replace it with the\nappropriate resistance and", 
    "then compute the appropriate--", 
    "solve the appropriate set of\nequations, which would all be", 
    "linear because in the piecewise\nlinear method, I&#39;m",
