    "SPEAKER: OK.", 
    "Without any further delay, let's dive into the theory of", 
    "second order circuits.", 
    "So I will do so by analyzing the circuit.", 
    "So this is VI of t.", 
    "I'm going to connect an inductor here, a resistor", 
    "here, and a capacitor like so.", 
    "I'm going to pick this as my ground node for node analysis.", 
    "This has value L, resistance R, and capacitance C. The", 
    "voltage across the capacitor is V of t, and the current in", 
    "the series circuit is i of t.", 
    "But this has the ground node, this node here will also have", 
    "voltage v. This is my node with voltage vA, and then", 
    "here, because of my clever choice of ground node--", 
    "I picked one of the terminals of my input", 
    "voltage source as ground--", 
    "the node voltage here is directly VI.", 
    "So I have two nodes here with the two unknown", 
    "voltages, V and VA.", 
    "So I'm going to dive right into the node method, and use", 
    "the node method to write down the node", 
    "equations for V and VA.", 
    "So my goal here is to develop the equations that govern the", 
    "behavior of the circuit so I can go ahead and solve them,", 
    "and figure out the dynamic software system", 
    "using the node method.", 
    "So before I do that, I just want to give you a very quick", 
    "review of some element rules for capacitors and resistors.", 
    "So for inductors, we know that the voltage across an inductor", 
    "is given by L di dt.", 
    "If the current through the conductor is IL and then the", 
    "voltage is VL, they're related by the VL equals L di L dt.", 
    "I can also express this in an integral form.", 
    "But if I bring L to the left-hand side and integrate", 
    "both sides, here's what I get.", 
    "1 by L minus infinity dt, VL dt is equal to iL.", 
    "I have similar equations for capacitors.", 
    "So the current through the capacitor, you", 
    "recall, is C dv dt.", 
    "So the current see iC through a capacitor is", 
    "given by C dv C dt.", 
    "I can also write this in an integral form as follows.", 
    "If I bring down C to the left-hand side, I get 1", 
    "divided by C integral minus infinity to t iC dt, and that", 
    "is equal to VC.", 
    "So I want you to keep those elements rules for inductors", 
    "and capacitors in mind as we write these equations.", 
    "So let's go ahead.", 
    "Let me start with writing the equation for node with voltage", 
    "V. So let's take a look.", 
    "At that node, I need to sum the currents going into the", 
    "note to 0, which is equivalent to saying, I equate the", 
    "current coming into the node from the left to the current", 
    "going out of the node below.", 
    "So I can equate those two currents--", 
    "current coming in to current going out.", 
    "So what is the current coming into the node?", 
    "Well, the current coming into the node is pretty", 
    "straightforward.", 
    "It's through the resistor R, and that is simply Va minus V", 
    "divided by R. That's a current coming into the node, and that", 
    "must equal the current going through the", 
    "capacitor, which is i.", 
    "And i through the capacitor, in terms of the voltage, is", 
    "simply C dv dt.", 
    "In case you're wondering where the VC disappeared, notice", 
    "that I'm just calling the voltage across the capacitor V", 
    "so I'm not getting around a whole a boatload of subscripts", 
    "around with me.", 
    "So that's my first equation.", 
    "Next let me get the equation at node with voltage VA.", 
    "So at the node with voltage VA, I can find out the current", 
    "coming in, and I can equate that to the current", 
    "going to the right.", 
    "That's the easy part, first. The current going out to the", 
    "right is simply VA minus V divided by R. That's easy,", 
    "it's through a resistor.", 
    "And the current coming in through the left is a current", 
    "through the inductor.", 
    "So the current through the inductor coming in here is", 
    "related to the voltages VI and VA.", 
    "That is also pretty simple.", 
    "So the current will simply be 1 by L integral of the", 
    "difference between these two voltages from here.", 
    "So from here, it's 1 by L integral of the voltage across", 
    "the inductor, and that will be the current", 
    "going through the inductor.", 
    "So let me go ahead and write that down.", 
    "So 1 by L minus infinity to t, a voltage across the inductor", 
    "which is VI minus VA dt.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "Two equations, and I have two unknowns--", 
    "V is my unknown, and VA is my unknown.", 
    "So let's say I want to find out the dynamics of the", 
    "voltage across the capacitor and the", 
    "current across the capacitor.", 
    "So let me focus on V. So therefore, I need", 
    "to get rid of VA.", 
    "So I have two equations, V and VA.", 
    "If I can get to the VA, then I'll be left with one equation", 
    "for V, which I can then go ahead and solve.", 
    "Just as a quick little aside, notice that since this is a", 
    "second-order circuit, it's a second-order RLC circuit here,", 
    "I have two state variables.", 
    "So let me just make a quick note here.", 
    "Two state variables.", 
    "One is the voltage across the capacitor, and the second", 
    "state variable is the current through the inductor I. Just a", 
    "quick little aside for you.", 
    "So now that I have the two basic equations for the node", 
    "with voltage V and node with voltage VA, I now need to get", 
    "rid of VA somehow from these two equations."
