    "Well, as you might imagine, it's not too hard to figure", 
    "that one out.", 
    "So for instance, I have omega here.", 
    "And I have Vl divided by Vi.", 
    "Notice that, for very low frequencies, inductor appears", 
    "like a short circuit, OK?", 
    "So a very low drop across the inductor.", 
    "So inductor looks like a short.", 
    "For very high frequencies, the inductor looks", 
    "like an open circuit.", 
    "So expect most of the voltage to fall across the inductor.", 
    "OK, so in this case, I would be getting a high-pass filter.", 
    "And of course, if I had a high-Q circuit, if this is", 
    "omega naught, if I had a high-Q circuit, then I would", 
    "get this peaky response across the inductor.", 
    "And this would be Q, while this level would be one.", 
    "OK, so this is pretty complementary, in action, to", 
    "taking the voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "Now you also recall we can take the voltage across the", 
    "inductor capacitor pair.", 
    "So let's say we take the voltage across the inductor", 
    "capacitor pair.", 
    "And that's called this Vlc.", 
    "OK, we saw this as well.", 
    "And if I get Vlc divided by Vi, the magnitude, then you", 
    "recall we had a band stop action.", 
    "OK, we had an action that looked like that.", 
    "And the reason for that was, for very high frequencies, the", 
    "inductor appeared like an open.", 
    "OK, so all the voltage dropped across the LC pair.", 
    "And for low frequencies, the capacitor appeared like an", 
    "open circuit.", 
    "And so, there again, all the voltage dropped", 
    "across the LC pair.", 
    "But as I approached omega naught, then the impedance of", 
    "the inductor and capacitor tended to cancel out.", 
    "And at that frequency, I would get a very low voltage drop", 
    "across this low, low impedance.", 
    "And therefore, I would get a notch.", 
    "OK, so this would be a band stop filter.", 
    "So now you realize why we spend so much attention on", 
    "this RLC circuit.", 
    "It's an absolutely amazing, absolutely stellar", 
    "circuit, all right?", 
    "And depending on where we take the voltage, we could get", 
    "various kinds of filters.", 
    "In fact, I encourage you, in the circuit sandbox, to go and", 
    "build an RLC circuit like this, apply inputs, or go", 
    "ahead and look at the AC response and look at the way", 
    "this frequency response is, OK?", 
    "So let me write that down for you so you remember", 
    "to go and do it.", 
    "It's not required, but I encourage you to go and do it.", 
    "OK, let me write that down.", 
    "So in your circuit sandbox there's a button called AC", 
    "Analysis, OK?", 
    "AC Analysis is simply another way of saying sinusoidal", 
    "steady state analysis.", 
    "And when you hit that button, you go to specify, put in the", 
    "voltage probe, for the voltage that you want to", 
    "measure, such as VR.", 
    "And then you also have to apply a input, what are the", 
    "voltages you want with respect to which you", 
    "want to transfer function.", 
    "And so you have to indicate a Vi or some", 
    "reference voltage as well.", 
    "And then, the AC analysis plots the magnitude of the", 
    "ratio of the two voltages, all right?", 
    "So I encourage you to go and run AC Analysis in your", 
    "circuit sandbox.", 
    "Again, AC Analysis is synonymous with \"plot me the", 
    "frequency response,\" all right?", 
    "But I encourage you to go and try it out.", 
    "I think you will have a lot of fun.", 
    "And certainly for me, when I first got into these peaky", 
    "circuits, playing around with these filters and seeing the", 
    "peaky response as omega came close to omega naught was just", 
    "absolutely breathtaking.", 
    "OK, I hope you have as much fun as I did."
