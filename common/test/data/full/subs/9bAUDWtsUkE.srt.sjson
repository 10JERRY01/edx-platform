    "PROFESSOR: In the previous\nsegment, we saw that circuits", 
    "composed of linear elements\nwere, themselves, linear.", 
    "In this segment, we will see\nthat linear circuits or linear", 
    "systems can be analyzed with\nextremely powerful techniques.", 
    "We will study two of these\nproperties of circuits,", 
    "homogeneity and superposition,\nin this segment.", 
    "Let&#39;s start by studying the\nproperty of homogeneity.", 
    "So what does homogeneity mean?", 
    "Supposing we have a system with\na bunch of inputs one", 
    "output here.", 
    "And let&#39;s say the inputs\nare x1, x2, and so on.", 
    "And for these xes let&#39;s say the\ncorresponding output is y.", 
    "Let me add a little cartoon\nhere, just to", 
    "make it easy to follow.", 
    "As they say, a picture\nis worth 1,000 words.", 
    "So let&#39;s say, if you have apple\nas an input and you get", 
    "a different kind of apple as an\noutput, then let&#39;s look at", 
    "what the property of\nhomogeneity says.", 
    "If I take the same\nsystem and if I", 
    "multiply each of the inputs--", 
    "x1, x2, and the old output, y--\nif I multiply each of the", 
    "inputs with some constant,\nalpha, then the property of", 
    "homogeneity says that the output\nwill also be multiplied", 
    "by the same value, alpha.", 
    "So this is the homogeneity\nproperty.", 
    "And in terms of our picture, if\nyou have an Apple and you", 
    "took a fraction of the apple\nout, then your output would", 
    "also have the same fraction\nof the apple out.", 
    "So this is the homogeneity\nproperty.", 
    "Next let&#39;s look at another\nextremely powerful technique,", 
    "superposition.", 
    "Now superposition is a property\nof linear circuits,", 
    "and let&#39;s first understand\nwhat this property means.", 
    "So supposing I have\na system here.", 
    "And what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll\napply two sets of", 
    "inputs to the system.", 
    "So in the first set, let&#39;s say\nI apply the a set of inputs,", 
    "x1a, x2a, and so on.", 
    "And let&#39;s say that that gives\nrise to the a set of outputs.", 
    "And then if I take\nthe same system--", 
    "just to make it clear,\nlet me mark it as s.", 
    "If I take the same system and\nI apply a b set of inputs--", 
    "so x1b, x2b, and so on--", 
    "and if I get a corresponding\noutput, yb, then what can we", 
    "say about the resulting\nsystem?", 
    "And just to make it very clear,\ngoing back to our", 
    "pictures and cartoons here,\nlet&#39;s say the a set of inputs", 
    "corresponds to apples,\na for apples.", 
    "And the b set of inputs goes\non to blueberries.", 
    "So jokingly here, if I feed a\nbunch of apples to the system", 
    "and I get applesauce at the\noutput, and on the other hand,", 
    "if I feed a bunch of blueberries\nto the system and", 
    "I get blueberry sauce at the\noutput, then let&#39;s do some fun", 
    "stuff here.", 
    "Suppose I take the same system\nand I feed through the system", 
    "the sum of both of\nthese inputs.", 
    "In other words, if I feed it\nx1a, x2a, and so on, and I add", 
    "to each corresponding input the\nb set of inputs, so I get", 
    "x1b here and x2b here-- so\nnotice that this is here, and", 
    "the b set of inputs is here.", 
    "So notice that all I&#39;ve\ndone is I&#39;ve added up", 
    "corresponding inputs.", 
    "What superposition tells me is\nthat my outputs will be a sum", 
    "of the corresponding inputs.", 
    "In other words, if I had ya\nwith the a set of inputs", 
    "alone, and I had yb with the b\nset of inputs alone, then if I", 
    "sum the corresponding inputs,\nthe a and the b inputs, then", 
    "my output will be a sum of the\ncorresponding outputs as well.", 
    "And again, jokingly, if I feed\napples and blueberries to the", 
    "input, then in this case,\njokingly again, maybe I get", 
    "mixed fruit jam.", 
    "How does this yield something\ninteresting for us?", 
    "Let me do a specific example\nof the property of", 
    "superposition and see how this\nwill yield a very interesting", 
    "technique to analyze\nlinear circuits.", 
    "Again, remember, both the\nhomogeneity and superposition", 
    "property applies to\nlinear circuits.", 
    "So let me take a specific\ninstance of", 
    "superposition here.", 
    "And so I take some system, a\nlinear system, and let&#39;s say I", 
    "have two inputs that\nI apply, v1 and v2.", 
    "And let&#39;s say my goal is to find\nout what the output is.", 
    "What I want to show you is\nthat, by the method of", 
    "superposition, I can use a\ndivide and conquer technique.", 
    "What I can do is I can take the\nsame system and I can set", 
    "the v2 output to 0 and\napply just the v1.", 
    "And I measure the corresponding\noutput, y1.", 
    "So y1 here is the partial\noutput, given that I have", 
    "applied a v1 alone.", 
    "Similarly, I take the same\nsystem and in this case,", 
    "second time around, I set v1\nto 0, and I apply v2 alone.", 
    "And then let&#39;s say I\nget y2 as my output", 
    "with v2 acting alone.", 
    "Then here is something\nvery interesting.", 
    "So by superposition from a\nprevious example, recall that", 
    "if I took one set of inputs and\na second set of inputs and", 
    "I summed up the corresponding\nvalues, then superposition", 
    "said my output would be a sum of\nthe individual outputs with", 
    "just each of those\napplied alone.", 
    "In other words, if I show the\nv1 as 0 and then if I sum to", 
    "that the second set of inputs,\n0 and v2 from here, so that", 
    "this got applied here and the\nfirst set of inputs got", 
    "applied here, then what\nsuperposition would say is", 
    "that my output would be a sum\nof the two partial outputs.", 
    "In other words, y1 would come\nfrom here and y2 would be the", 
    "same as the y2 with the\nv2 applied alone.", 
    "So this is an extremely\npowerful idea.", 
    "So to recap, what have\nI done here?", 
    "I have used a method of\nsuperposition to apply a set", 
    "of inputs in the\nfollowing way.", 
    "I started by saying that I have\na circuit and I want to", 
    "apply v1 and v2 to it and\ncompute the output.", 
    "Now rather than trying to solve\nthe circuit by applying", 
    "both v1 and v2, what I did was\nI broke it up into two", 
    "sub-problems. In the first\nsub-problem, what I did was I", 
    "applied v1 alone and set v2 to\n0, and then in the second", 
    "sub-problem, I applied v2 alone\nand I set v1 to be 0.", 
    "And I computed the two partial\noutputs, y1 and y2.", 
    "The method of superposition then\nsays that if I took the", 
    "two corresponding sets of inputs\nand summed them up,", 
    "then my output would be a sum\nof the two partial outputs.", 
    "Notice that at the input here,\nif you look at these two", 
    "inputs, the v1 plus 0 is simply\nthe v1, v2 plus 0 is", 
    "simply v2, which is the same\nas what I have here.", 
    "So in other words, I was able\nto solve the circuit that", 
    "contained v1 and v2 as inputs by\napplying just v1 alone and", 
    "then v2 alone, and then\nby summing up the two", 
    "corresponding outputs.", 
    "This will yield an incredibly\npowerful method for us called", 
    "the method of superposition.",
