    "SPEAKER 1: So let me show\nyou a fun little", 
    "demo involving gates.", 
    "Now I want you to be\nvery careful here,", 
    "lots of caveats here.", 
    "So if your grandmother asks\nyou, how big is a gate?", 
    "Don&#39;t say this big.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: [LAUGHS]", 
    "So this is how big gates used to\nbe, I would say, when they", 
    "were first invented.", 
    "OK, when they built gates out\nof discrete vacuum tubes and", 
    "so on, this is how big\na gate used to be.", 
    "So this is, well, roughly\nthat big.", 
    "Today, in a chip, in a small\nVLSI, very large-scale,", 
    "integrated circuit in a chip,\nwhich is about one centimeter", 
    "on the side, how many gates do\nyou think I can fit in a", 
    "thumbnail size chip?", 
    "Any guesses?", 
    "With today&#39;s technology,\nhow many gates", 
    "can I fit on a chip?", 
    "SPEAKER 2: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].", 
    "SPEAKER 1: It has to be more\nthan a million because I just", 
    "told you the Pentium\nIV was 20 million.", 
    "And that was a year ago.", 
    "How many?", 
    "SPEAKER 3: Pi over 20 million.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Well, 40 million\nis a good guess.", 
    "So on the order of 40 to 80\nmillion gates in a one square", 
    "centimeter.", 
    "Intel just announced\nthat they&#39;ll be", 
    "shipping a one billion--", 
    "oh, a chip containing one\nbillion switches.", 
    "OK, remember, this whole thing\nis a gate, inverter, a", 
    "resistor and a switch.", 
    "This thing is a switch.", 
    "So Intel&#39;s going to be shipping\nsomething containing", 
    "a billion of those\nlittle elements.", 
    "OK, just keep those large\nnumbers in mind.", 
    "So here is a little circuit that\nI showed you here, A, B,", 
    "the NAND gate, NAND gate\nof the output and", 
    "the inverter, OK?", 
    "So this output, A, is going to\nbe one whenever either A or B", 
    "is off, OK?", 
    "So the output is a one,\nin this case, when", 
    "both A and B are off.", 
    "I turn A to one, output\nis still a one.", 
    "So the moment I turn both of\nthese inputs to a one, --these", 
    "are ones-- the output\ngoes to zero.", 
    "That&#39;s the behavior\nof a NAND gate.", 
    "OK, if I switch any one the\ninputs to a zero, the output", 
    "should go to a one, OK?", 
    "Similarly, for the inverter\nhere, when the input&#39;s a zero,", 
    "the output&#39;s a one.", 
    "And when I switch it, so\nshould the output.", 
    "OK, now imagine a circuit,\na little chip, containing", 
    "billions of these devices, OK?", 
    "And just imagine all of these\nones and zeros flying around.", 
    "So one simple switch in the\ninput, like a click of a", 
    "keystroke, could actually cause\na billion signals in", 
    "your circuit to be\nflipping around.", 
    "OK, and that causes some fun\nstuff to happen, which we will", 
    "learn about a few\nmonths from now.", 
    "But for now, that&#39;s a quick show\nof a little circuit that", 
    "looks like that, OK?",
