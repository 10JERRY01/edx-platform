    "SPEAKER 1: Now that we have\nour digital playground, we", 
    "have to establish some\nconventions.", 
    "So in this playground, I\ncould have a sender.", 
    "The sender needs to send some\nvalue to a receiver.", 
    "And we know that if the right\nconvention is established", 
    "between logical values\nand voltage values--", 
    "the right convention and\nthe right contract is", 
    "established--", 
    "then senders can send values and\na receiver can receive the", 
    "value, and even that tolerate\nsome amount of", 
    "noise in the signal.", 
    "So as an example, the sender\ncould say, here is a 1 signal.", 
    "And the receiver needs\nto be able to say, I", 
    "see a logical 1.", 
    "So clearly, we need to establish\nsome kind of a", 
    "convention where for a\n1, the sender sends", 
    "some voltage value.", 
    "And the receiver needs to know\nthat for the voltage value", 
    "received, that is a logical\n1 or a logical 0.", 
    "There has to be some contract,\nsome kind of convention that", 
    "we have to follow.", 
    "Notice that here, I have\nused the voltages.", 
    "But again, it&#39;s all\nup to our design,", 
    "all up to our contracts.", 
    "I could very well have\nused currents.", 
    "I can use currents to encode\nlogical signals in them as", 
    "well, not just voltages.", 
    "So the question then is how\ndo I design these voltage", 
    "thresholds that reflect logical\nvalues in order to get", 
    "correct operation in digital\nsystems, and also get a good", 
    "amount of noise immunity?", 
    "So how do I go about\ndoing that?", 
    "This sequence of slides here\nwill talk about exactly how we", 
    "go about designing such\na convention.", 
    "So in this little chart here,\nI&#39;m going to talk about what", 
    "kind of voltage thresholds we\ncan establish in order to", 
    "associate them with\nlogical values.", 
    "So let&#39;s say I have a sender.", 
    "And I have a receiver\non this side.", 
    "And my goal is to try to send 0s\nand 1s so that the receiver", 
    "can receive them correctly.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with a really,\nreally simple approach.", 
    "So let&#39;s go with--", 
    "let&#39;s assume senders and\nreceivers can interpret values", 
    "between 0 and 5 volts.", 
    "And I&#39;ll do the simple thing.", 
    "Let&#39;s say I cut it down the\nmiddle at 2.5 volts.", 
    "I cut the voltage range\nat 2.5 volts.", 
    "And let&#39;s say that the sender,\nin order to send a logical 0,", 
    "sends any value between\n0 and 2.5 volts.", 
    "And similarly, to send a logical\n1, let&#39;s say the", 
    "sender sends a value between\n2.5 and 5 volts.", 
    "So here, for a 0 again, the\nsender sends a value", 
    "between 2.5 and 0.", 
    "And for 1, the sender sends a\nvalue between 2.5 and 5 volts.", 
    "And similarly, from the receiver\nstandpoint, if the", 
    "receiver sees any value between\n2.5 and 5 volts, it", 
    "interprets that as a 1.", 
    "And similarly, if it sees any\nvalue between 0 and 2.5 volts,", 
    "it will interpret that as a 0.", 
    "So notice here that I&#39;m\nusing two kinds of 0s.", 
    "I have a 0 volt to represent\nthe voltage value with the", 
    "unit 0 volts.", 
    "I&#39;m also referring to logical\nvalues, a logical 0.", 
    "And to distinguish it, I have\nput quotation marks around it.", 
    "So I can add quotation marks\naround all my logical values.", 
    "So recall earlier that\nthese logical", 
    "values are really symbols.", 
    "And I can call them 1 and 0,\nor I can call them true and", 
    "false, and so on and so forth.", 
    "And to distinguish between\nthem, I&#39;ll sometimes use", 
    "quotation marks.", 
    "But sometimes I&#39;ll simply call\nthem 1 and 0, or 0 and 1, and", 
    "you will have to know when I&#39;m\nusing logical values or", 
    "voltage values by the context.", 
    "Notice also that there&#39;s really\nno reason why I have to", 
    "use 5 volts and 0 volts\nto reflect 1 and a 0.", 
    "For all that I care, I could\nhave used 1 volt and 3 volts.", 
    "Or the 1 volt could signify a\nlogical 1, and 3 volts could", 
    "signify a logical 0.", 
    "At the end of the day, it&#39;s\nall about what is the", 
    "convention, what convention do\nreceivers and senders follow?", 
    "And they can just do the\nmapping, then, from the 1s--", 
    "from the voltage values to the\nlogical signals 1 and 0.", 
    "So going back to the convention\nthat I&#39;m proposing", 
    "here in this proposed\nconvention, anything above a", 
    "2.5, let&#39;s say, I call\na logical 1.", 
    "And if I see any voltage below\n2.5, all the way up to 0, I", 
    "call that a logical 0.", 
    "So does this work?", 
    "So I&#39;ll let you think about that\nfor a few seconds, and", 
    "then I&#39;ll tell you the answer.", 
    "So does this technique work?", 
    "Does this give you any\nnoise immunity?", 
    "Now, what happens here?",
