    "SPEAKER 1: OK, let's stare at selectivity a little longer.", 
    "OK, so we said that selectivity was related to", 
    "omega not by two, I'm sorry, by delta omega.", 
    "Where, as you recall, in this response, omega not was the", 
    "resonant frequency and that delta omega was, if this was", 
    "one, delta omega was the bandwidth at the point", 
    "measured at the point where the curve, the transfer", 
    "function curve, reached its one by", 
    "squared over two magnitude.", 
    "OK, so we know omega not.", 
    "OK, let's try to figure out what this relates to in terms", 
    "of second parameters.", 
    "We know omega not.", 
    "Omega not is one by lc.", 
    "What is delta omega.", 
    "Let's go ahead and measure delta omega by looking at the", 
    "point at which the transfer function features one by", 
    "square root to of its peak value.", 
    "So let's start by writing vr over vi.", 
    "We know that.", 
    "That is the resistance divided by the sum of all the", 
    "impedances.", 
    "Resistance plus j omega L plus one by j omega C. Let me just,", 
    "to make it easy to compute this, or you could go and do", 
    "this by brute force and figure out the omega, figure out", 
    "omega one and omega two.", 
    "Let's say this is omega one, and let's say that", 
    "this is omega two.", 
    "Omega one is where the transfer function reaches one", 
    "by square root to of its magnitude, and omega two is a", 
    "higher frequency at which it does the same thing.", 
    "So you could go compute that.", 
    "So the rest of this video will be me trying to compute this", 
    "bandwidth, OK?", 
    "Me trying to compute omega one and omega two.", 
    "And I just do it in a particular way.", 
    "You could do it any which way you like.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to divide both the", 
    "numerator and denominator by R.", 
    "So I divided by R. And here is what I get.", 
    "One plus j omega L divided by R. And let me move j up so I", 
    "get minus j divided by omega CR.", 
    "I divided both sides by R. And this is simply one plus.", 
    "Let me pull j out.", 
    "This is simply omega L over R minus one by omega CR.", 
    "Let me make sure I have that right.", 
    "Put a j out.", 
    "I get a minus here.", 
    "Omega LR, and I get one divided by omega CR.", 
    "Sounds about right.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Let me proceed with trying to figure out the point at which", 
    "the transfer function reaches one by square root two of its", 
    "peak value.", 
    "So recall, selectivity is indicated by omega not by", 
    "delta omega, and I am trying to figure out delta omega.", 
    "So I wrote down the VR over VI, and trying to figure out", 
    "where VR over VI reaches where its magnitude is one by square", 
    "root of two of its peak value.", 
    "OK, so note the following.", 
    "So note that the absolute magnitude is one", 
    "by square root 2.", 
    "When is that?", 
    "OK, when the VR over Vi is equal to--", 
    "we know what VR over VI is.", 
    "This is simply in terms of the notation I used earlier.", 
    "J omega L over R minus one by omega CR.", 
    "I know that.", 
    "OK.", 
    "At what point is the magnitude going to be one over the", 
    "square root of two?", 
    "OK, it is going to be when that is equal to, when that is", 
    "equal to one plus or minus j times one.", 
    "Notice when omega LR is bigger, I get plus j.", 
    "And when omega LR is lower or smaller than one over omega", 
    "CR, I get a negative.", 
    "And so the magnitude of the transfer function will be one", 
    "over square root two.", 
    "When I get this quantity here being equal to one.", 
    "Because notice that one plus j1 the magnitude of that is,", 
    "so the magnitude of this, if you refresh your complex", 
    "algebra, is simply one over the square root two.", 
    "And similarly, one over one minus j1 is also one by square", 
    "root of two.", 
    "If you recall, the way we take the magnitude is that we take", 
    "the real part squared and we add it to the imaginary part", 
    "squared and then take the square root.", 
    "And so we get one squared plus one squared, which is two, and", 
    "take the square root of that, we get square root of two.", 
    "And so we end up with one over square root of two.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So it means that the absolute magnitude is one over square", 
    "root of two when omega L divided by R minus 1 over", 
    "omega CR is equal to plus or minus one.", 
    "That is when omega L over R minus one over omega CR is", 
    "equal to plus or minus one.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So that has to be true.", 
    "But omega L over R minus one over omega CR is either", 
    "one or minus one.", 
    "That's when my magnitude will reach one over the", 
    "square root of two.", 
    "OK, so this is true when--", 
    "So if I multiply it out, if I multiply both sides by omega,", 
    "let's say I want to get omega up to the, take omega from the", 
    "denominator.", 
    "OK, so if I multiply both sides by omega, I get that", 
    "omega squared L over R minus one over CR.", 
    "And let me pull plus or minus one to the left-hand side.", 
    "So I get minus plus omega equals zero.", 
    "OK.", 
    "And then let me multiply out both sides by R over L. So I", 
    "get omega squared free and clear on the left-hand side.", 
    "This will simplify my math a little bit.", 
    "All I'm doing is math right now.", 
    "OK, just trying to find out what the value of omega is for", 
    "which VR over VI magnitude is one over the", 
    "square root of two.", 
    "OK, so if I do that, if I multiply both sides by R over", 
    "L, I get omega squared, omega squared, and let me do minus", 
    "plus omega R over L. And then I have a minus 1/CR.", 
    "And I multiply that by R over L.", 
    "The R and R cancel out.", 
    "And I get one over LC equals zero.", 
    "So in other words, this equation tells me if I solve", 
    "this equation, it will tell me the values of omega for which", 
    "the transfer function is one over the square root of two.", 
    "OK, so I just have to go and look at the", 
    "roots of both equations.", 
    "Roots of both equations.", 
    "And those will give me omega one and omega two that I set", 
    "out to find out.", 
    "OK, let me go ahead and take the positive", 
    "roots of both equations.", 
    "So let me start with omega squared minus omega R over L", 
    "minus one by LC equals zero.", 
    "And so that will give me omega one.", 
    "And that'll be solving this quadratic.", 
    "That root will be minus the coefficient of omega, which is", 
    "minus times minus is a plus, so I get R over L. And I have", 
    "a dividing, divide by two, plus half square root of the", 
    "square of the coefficient of omega, which is R squared by L", 
    "squared, minus four times the coefficient of omega squared", 
    "and the term without the omega in it.", 
    "And since that has a minus, this gives me", 
    "four divided by LC.", 
    "Similarly, I get omega two is from the next equation, omega", 
    "squared plus omega RL, R divided by L minus one over LC", 
    "equals zero.", 
    "I get minus R over 2L plus half square root of R squared", 
    "divided by L squared plus 4LC.", 
    "Those are my omega one and omega two, and", 
    "those are my two roots.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So what is delta omega?", 
    "OK, so these are my positive roots.", 
    "Omega one and omega two are both positive.", 
    "And let me now get the bandwidth, my bandwidth delta", 
    "omega, as mentioned earlier, simply omega one", 
    "minus omega two here.", 
    "OK, and it looks like I just interchanged the", 
    "names of the two roots.", 
    "So if you recall, my bandwidth, my transfer", 
    "function, I called this omega one and I called this--", 
    "I'm sorry, I called this omega two.", 
    "So my bandwidth was omega two minus omega one.", 
    "So in this case, I should have this labeled this guy as omega", 
    "two and the other guy as omega one.", 
    "Let me go and do that just for clarity.", 
    "So omega two and omega one.", 
    "So my delta omega will simply be in this case do the same", 
    "thing here.", 
    "Omega two minus omega one.", 
    "So it all comes out nice and positive.", 
    "Omega two minus omega one.", 
    "OK, since omega two is greater than omega one here,", 
    "so what do I get?", 
    "So omega two minus omega one.", 
    "Notice that this term here cancels out with the", 
    "corresponding term from omega two.", 
    "OK, so what I'm left with, omega two minus omega one, is", 
    "simply R over L. That's pretty nice.", 
    "It's a pretty simple term.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So delta omega is omega two minus omega one, and that is", 
    "equal to R over L. OK, I have my delta omega.", 
    "I'm almost there."
