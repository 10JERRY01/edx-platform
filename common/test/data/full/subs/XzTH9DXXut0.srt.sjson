    "SPEAKER: I've drawn you a cleaner", 
    "picture of the AM receiver.", 
    "So this is the Thevenin antenna model.", 
    "And this is L and this is my tunable capacitor.", 
    "And the signal across the LC combination then goes into", 
    "other forms of processing, demodulation, and", 
    "amplification, and so on, that we won't cover in this course.", 
    "We don't cover demodulation.", 
    "You know what amplification, of course.", 
    "All right, so how does this work?", 
    "How does the radio work?", 
    "So let me plot out something interesting for you.", 
    "So in this case, let me go ahead and plot", 
    "the frequency f.", 
    "I'm not plotting omega, which is the frequency in radians.", 
    "It's the angular frequency.", 
    "In this case, I'm simply plotting f, the frequency of", 
    "the signal.", 
    "And then on the y-axis, let me plot signal strength.", 
    "So the way radio system work is that different radio", 
    "stations would be transmitting at different frequencies.", 
    "So, for example, in the Boston area, there are a bunch of", 
    "radio stations that transmit the following frequency.", 
    "So for example, one of the radio stations that I listen", 
    "to is 1030 in the Amplitude Modulation band, AM band.", 
    "So let me mark that down.", 
    "That's 1030.", 
    "And then, I may have other signals being transmitted by", 
    "other radio station.", 
    "So for example, I may have a station transmitting at 1020,", 
    "somebody else transmitting at 1010, someone transmitting at", 
    "a 1,000 hertz.", 
    "OK, 1,000 kilohertz, sorry.", 
    "And it goes on and on.", 
    "And it starts off at 540 kilohertz.", 
    "And then it goes all the way up from 1040 here, it goes up,", 
    "and ends up at 1,600 kilohertz.", 
    "So from 540 kilohertz, all the way up to 1,600 kilohertz.", 
    "So when stations transmit, they try to-- so let's say,", 
    "for example, as I said 1030 in the Boston", 
    "area is WBZ News Radio.", 
    "It tries to maximize its signal strength around the", 
    "1030 frequency, 1030 kilohertz frequency range.", 
    "So it tries to maximize it there.", 
    "And then it tries to make sure that the signal strength", 
    "doesn't encroach too much into neighboring bands.", 
    "So it may look something like this.", 
    "1020 will maximize its signal strength at 1020.", 
    "And it may look something like this.", 
    "1040 will look something like this, and so on.", 
    "1010 will go up here and would look like this.", 
    "So 1,000 kilohertz would look like this, and so on.", 
    "So notice that each of these gets a roughly", 
    "10 kilohertz band.", 
    "If we look at here to here is where a station transmits.", 
    "Each of these stations gets roughly 10 kilohertz.", 
    "So, for example, WBZ is centered at 1030, and it gets", 
    "a 10 kilohertz band, ranging from 1025 to 1035.", 
    "So it's going to focus its signal strength, its 10", 
    "kilohertz band in that range.", 
    "So let's say, if I want to listen to WBZ News Radio, then", 
    "I have to tune my capacitor here such that", 
    "the band-pass filter--", 
    "OK, so recall this works like a band-pass filter.", 
    "So the voltage vi, the resistor, inductor, capacitor.", 
    "This works like a band-pass filter.", 
    "So if I want to get 1030, then I have to tune my capacitor", 
    "such that my filter transfer function--", 
    "let me go pick a different, let me pick green because the", 
    "band-pass filter let's that frequency pass through.", 
    "So recall the band-pass filter has a characteristic that", 
    "looks like this.", 
    "So what I'm going to do, if I want to listen WBZ, I'm going", 
    "to take my filter and I am going to make that filter have", 
    "its passing band focused where I care the most. So the", 
    "band-pass filter is going to be focused here.", 
    "So what happens now?", 
    "So when this is passed through, this band-pass filter", 
    "will allow the 1030 range to mostly get through, and it", 
    "will attenuate everything else that's further away.", 
    "Now, notice that ideally, I want it to be a perfect", 
    "band-pass, but those are very hard to build.", 
    "And so it will let through a little bit of", 
    "the neighboring bands.", 
    "That's why with AM radio you always got some interference", 
    "from the sides of the two neighboring bands.", 
    "So notice here that I got a little bit of this piece", 
    "coming through, and a little bit of this", 
    "piece coming through.", 
    "Fundamentally, that was a small value.", 
    "Mostly I got the 1030 coming through.", 
    "So this was the filter, the band-pass filter.", 
    "Let me just clean up the writing a little bit here.", 
    "This was a band-pass filter.", 
    "So by tuning my band-pass filter to the center frequency", 
    "omega 0 being 1030 kilohertz, I was able to get that news", 
    "radio through.", 
    "So notice here--", 
    "we spend some more time on these kinds of filters.", 
    "And notice here that selectivity is important.", 
    "What is selectivity?", 
    "Selectivity has to do with trying to capture the signal", 
    "in a given range.", 
    "I'm trying to capture the signal in the given range, and", 
    "nothing else.", 
    "And naturally it's just selectivity.", 
    "In the next video, we will see that the selectivity relates", 
    "to something that you've seen before.", 
    "To something, a parameter that you have seen before.", 
    "We will look at that next.", 
    "I'll keep you in suspense.", 
    "I won't tell you what that parameter is.", 
    "Although, you can start guessing what that", 
    "parameter might be.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is start looking at some more", 
    "filter circuits.", 
    "And in the context of those filter circuits, try to figure", 
    "out what the selectivity parameter is.", 
    "So wait for video 2, and then we will get back to", 
    "selectivity.", 
    "In the meantime, I hope you have had a good sense of the", 
    "front end of a AM radio receiver works, where radio", 
    "stations broadcast signals in the given frequency band and", 
    "the front end has a LC circuit with a tunable capacitor that", 
    "tends to filter out the signal range of interest."
