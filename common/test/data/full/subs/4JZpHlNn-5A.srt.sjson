    "SPEAKER 1: Before we begin a comparison of time domain and", 
    "frequency domain analysis, I just want to stress something", 
    "that I had mentioned earlier, which is that identifying the", 
    "time domain behavior of the circuit is easy from the", 
    "impedance analysis.", 
    "Because if you recall, for our RLC circuit, Vc over Vi from", 
    "the previous video was given by omega naught squared", 
    "divided by s squared plus 2s plus omega naught squared.", 
    "The s was equal to j omega.", 
    "s was a shorthand for j omega.", 
    "Now, you can get the time domain behavior completely", 
    "from this equation here.", 
    "You don't have to go write differential equations.", 
    "So if you recall, how did s come about?", 
    "Do you recall, how did s come about in our analysis?", 
    "OK, if you recall, at a given point in our analysis, we had", 
    "substituted e to the st for a response, and when we", 
    "differentiated e to the st with respect to time, we got s", 
    "e raised to st.", 
    "And the e raised to st things canceled out.", 
    "So each time you saw a d by dt, we ended up with an s in", 
    "our equation.", 
    "So what we can do is do a reverse mapping.", 
    "So wherever we see an s, we can go and stick in a d by dt", 
    "there and derive the differential equation in a", 
    "backward step.", 
    "Let's go ahead and try that out.", 
    "So let's write this equation here.", 
    "So I get Vc, and let me multiply it by s squared plus", 
    "2 alpha s plus omega naught squared.", 
    "So I get s squared plus 2 alpha s plus omega naught", 
    "squared, and that is equal to omega naught squared Vi.", 
    "Let me write that down as omega naught squared Vi.", 
    "In the frequency domain analysis, recall that Vi was", 
    "the real amplitude of the sinusoidal input.", 
    "So as promised, wherever you see an s squared, stick in a", 
    "second derivative.", 
    "OK, so what I can now do is I can derive my differential", 
    "equation very easily as follows.", 
    "So d squared Vc, where Vc is the time domain signal.", 
    "OK, like this.", 
    "2 alpha d by dt of Vc plus omega naught squared Vc.", 
    "And that is equal to omega naught squared.", 
    "And if I have a sinusoid Vi, then I would replace the", 
    "capital V small i with a sinusoidal time domain and put", 
    "Vi cosine omega t.", 
    "However, just for kicks, let's say we care", 
    "about a step input.", 
    "So for example, let's try a step input.", 
    "So for a step input, the input signal will simply be some dc", 
    "value starting at time t equal to 0.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "So I've very quickly written my differential equation for a", 
    "step input for the same circuit completely by using", 
    "frequency domain analysis.", 
    "OK, and the trick here was to replace s with d by dt, and do", 
    "the transformation.", 
    "And so recall, as before, even if I did the time domain", 
    "analysis, my Q is the same, omega naught by 2 alpha, and", 
    "for the series RLC circuit, 2 alpha is R divided by L. So I", 
    "ended up with omega naught divided by R over L, which is", 
    "Q.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So what I want to do next is what I promised you.", 
    "OK?", 
    "I would like to go into using Q to look at both time domain", 
    "and frequency domain behavior.", 
    "OK, let's get right down to it.", 
    "So what I would like to do, using Q to compare time domain", 
    "and frequency domain.", 
    "And my shorthand notation would be FD for frequency", 
    "domain and TD for time domain.", 
    "What I'm going to do is--", 
    "the two are identical circuits.", 
    "So if you look to your left and to the right, the circuits", 
    "are identical, with one little difference.", 
    "On the left hand side, for the left hand circuit, the", 
    "frequency domain, that would apply a sinusoid.", 
    "And the time domain signal is given by Vi cosine omega t.", 
    "For the time domain, just for fun, I'm going", 
    "to use a unit step.", 
    "Using different inputs here, OK?", 
    "So I use a unit step for the time domain circuit.", 
    "In other words, vI will be equal to u of t.", 
    "And recall all our usual parameters.", 
    "Q is omega naught by 2 alpha.", 
    "With a time domain or frequency domain, the Q of the", 
    "circuit is Q, which is why I can use Q to analyze both time", 
    "and frequency domain behaviors.", 
    "Omega naught r is 1 by square root of LC.", 
    "That stays the same.", 
    "2 alpha, for the series RLC circuit, is R over L.", 
    "So I want to look at these two circuits.", 
    "In the time domain, I'll look at the unit step, and in the", 
    "frequency domain, look at the frequency", 
    "response of the circuit.", 
    "So my goal will be, as I change Q, I'd like to find out", 
    "how the time domain behavior and the frequency domain", 
    "behavior correlate with each other.", 
    "And as we have seen in the past, we can do the analysis", 
    "in three cases.", 
    "So one case is for overdamped behavior.", 
    "So for this overdamped behavior, alpha is greater", 
    "than omega naught.", 
    "And in terms of Q, Q-- which is equal to", 
    "omega naught by 2 alpha--", 
    "is less than 1/2.", 
    "OK, low Q. The low Q means damped.", 
    "Hi Q, high Q circuit, high Q filters is peaky filters.", 
    "OK, so this is overdamped.", 
    "Then I'm going to do alpha less than omega naught, or Q--", 
    "which is still omega naught by 2 alpha--", 
    "is greater than 1/2.", 
    "OK, this is high Q. This is underdamped.", 
    "And then, finally, a look at alpha equals omega naught.", 
    "And in this case, Q equals 1/2.", 
    "This is critically damped.", 
    "So let's look at these three cases for each of these values", 
    "of Q. For Q less than 1/2, which is overdamped, Q greater", 
    "than 1/2, which is underdamped, and Q equals 1/2", 
    "which is critically damped.", 
    "And note that these values of Q are related to alpha being", 
    "greater than omega naught, less than omega naught, or", 
    "equal to omega naught, given the definition of Q, in terms", 
    "of omega naught divided by 2 alpha."
