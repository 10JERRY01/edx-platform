    "SPEAKER 1: It is always fun to plot these capacitor charging", 
    "and discharging voltages as I build circuits with", 
    "capacitors, resistors, sources, and things like that.", 
    "So let's go ahead and jump into doing that.", 
    "So out here I have repeated my solution where the voltage on", 
    "the capacitor is the value of the source, VI, the constant", 
    "source voltage.", 
    "And to that I add a exponentially decaying form of", 
    "V0 minus VI where V0 is the initial value of the voltage", 
    "on the capacitor.", 
    "And let me go ahead and draw the capacitor circuit just as", 
    "a reference.", 
    "So I was given my voltage was VI, my resistor was R, and", 
    "this was my capacitor, ground, and the node", 
    "voltage here was VC.", 
    "All right, let's go ahead and do a plot.", 
    "First, let's just do it using the equation", 
    "just by pure math.", 
    "And then I'd like to look at the circuit and give you some", 
    "more intuition as to why the figure looks the way it does.", 
    "All right, so looking at this equation at time t equal to 0,", 
    "what happens?", 
    "When time t equals 0, e raised to 0 goes to 1.", 
    "And so then since this is 1, I can cancel out VI and minus VI", 
    "and I am let with VC equals V0.", 
    "OK, so at time t equal to 0, VC is equal to V0.", 
    "Well I'm glad the math matched reality because I was given", 
    "that the initial condition, the initial value of the", 
    "voltage on the capacitor at time t equal to 0 was V0.", 
    "And it is good to note that that is indeed", 
    "true from the equation.", 
    "All right, so start out at VI and then what happens?", 
    "So then let's look at what happens at", 
    "time t equals infinity.", 
    "And time t equals infinity, this part here, e raised to", 
    "minus infinity, goes to 0.", 
    "So this whole thing goes to 0.", 
    "And so let's assume in this [? four ?] in this little", 
    "chart here that VI is greater than V0, just for the plot.", 
    "So VI is greater than V0 in my plot.", 
    "And if this right-hand expression goes to 0, then my", 
    "final value for Vi is simply VI.", 
    "So let's say VI is here.", 
    "The final value for VC, so for large values of t, will be out", 
    "here, where it will be VI.", 
    "And between V0 an VI, I have a rising curve given by", 
    "something that looks like this.", 
    "So the form of that is given by this expression here.", 
    "The initial value is V0, the final value is VI, and I get", 
    "the rise time here that is governed by the", 
    "equation shown out here.", 
    "It is of the form that is the typical rise of the form 1", 
    "minus e raised to minus t dived by RC.", 
    "We'll look at that more closely in a second.", 
    "But not surprisingly, both my initial condition and the", 
    "final value are as is expected from the equation.", 
    "And we look at the circuit and we'll convince ourselves that", 
    "is what we expect.", 
    "So let's go right down to it.", 
    "So I'm given that the initial condition on the", 
    "capacitor is V0.", 
    "So at time t equal to 0, this is V0.", 
    "So when time starts at time t equal to 0, VC is V0 which is", 
    "the initial condition on the capacitor.", 
    "But then what happens?", 
    "So notice here I have voltage source and I have a voltage", 
    "across the capacitor where VI is greater than VC.", 
    "I'm sorry, VI is greater than V0.", 
    "If VI is greater than V0, then if this is V0 here and this is", 
    "VI, there is a current that will flow in that direction.", 
    "That current will cause a charge to build up on the", 
    "capacitor, thereby increasing its voltage.", 
    "The voltage will keep increasing, and so this is the", 
    "increase in voltage.", 
    "The voltage will keep increasing until the voltage", 
    "on the capacitor equals the input voltage VI.", 
    "And when it equals input voltage VI the circuit comes", 
    "to rest and there's no more current to the resistor.", 
    "So therefore over time the final voltage on the capacitor", 
    "will match the source voltage and then the whole system will", 
    "come to rest and there will not be any current flowing", 
    "through the circuit.", 
    "Before I move on to a couple of other interesting points, I", 
    "want to show you a couple of interesting aspects of this", 
    "little graph that I have plotted here.", 
    "One interesting fact with these capacitor graphs is that", 
    "if I take the slope at the starting point here time t", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "If I take the slope of this, and look at where the slope", 
    "intersects the final value of the voltage on the capacitor,", 
    "and from that intersection point if I draw a vertical", 
    "line to the t axis, then that value will be the time", 
    "constant RC.", 
    "We can convince ourselves that that is the case.", 
    "Why is that?", 
    "OK, let's look at it.", 
    "So this line here, this is a slope at time t equal to 0.", 
    "So if I look at my equation for VC, the slope at time t", 
    "equal to 0 is given by dVC by dt at time evaluated at time t", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "So that is given by the slope of this expression here.", 
    "If I take the derivative of that with respect to t, so dVI", 
    "by dt goes to 0.", 
    "And then I get V0 minus VI.", 
    "I get a minus sign here.", 
    "And e raised to minus t divided by RC, I get RC down", 
    "here and evaluate it at t equal to 0.", 
    "And that evaluated at t equal to 0 is simply VI minus V0", 
    "divided by RC.", 
    "So this is the slope at time t equal to 0.", 
    "So this slope is given by VI minus V0 divided by RC.", 
    "So if we look at the slope here, the slope is this", 
    "portion divided by this portion.", 
    "And so this portion we know is VI minus V0.", 
    "And then this part must therefore be RC.", 
    "So it's VI minus V0 divided by RC.", 
    "And so therefore this must be RC.", 
    "So in general I can take the slope of the voltage curve,", 
    "and for that matter current curves as well.", 
    "And if I see where it intersects with the final", 
    "value on the capacitor and then project it down to the", 
    "[? exact ?]", 
    "with the t-axis, that's where I get my time constant.", 
    "Let me make another little observation here.", 
    "I can rearrange the terms in the equation here.", 
    "So I could rearrange and write this as follows.", 
    "I can write this as VC equal to, so I can say V0 times e", 
    "raised to minus t by RC.", 
    "So it's V0 e raised to minus t divided by RC.", 
    "And then I can add to that.", 
    "There's VI here and minus VI here so I get a VI.", 
    "Times, so there's a 1 here and there's a minus e raised to", 
    "minus t divided by RC.", 
    "That's another way off expressing the voltage across", 
    "the capacitor based on rearranging the terms. And so", 
    "here, let me get some space here, so VC of", 
    "t is given by V0.", 
    "And what is V0?", 
    "V0 is the initial value of VC on the capacitor.", 
    "And so that is VC of 0 e raised to minus", 
    "t divided by RC.", 
    "Plus, what is VI?", 
    "VI here is the final value of the voltage on the capacitor.", 
    "Notice here that the final voltage on the capacitor will", 
    "be the same as the voltage on the source.", 
    "And so I could write that down as VC of infinity.", 
    "That's the final voltage on the capacitor 1 minus t", 
    "divided by RC.", 
    "So different people remember this differently.", 
    "And generally when I'm given circuits like this, I don't", 
    "need to go and solve a differential equation to find", 
    "the answer.", 
    "With some practice you should just be able to look at the", 
    "circuit directly and derive the shape of either the", 
    "current or the voltage curve for the capacitor simply by", 
    "observation.", 
    "So you may want to remember this one or this one.", 
    "Just pick a form that you find convenient", 
    "and go with the form.", 
    "What I like to remember is the way I look", 
    "at the graph directly.", 
    "And so I get the initial voltage on the capacitor.", 
    "I know the final voltage given by this.", 
    "And I join them by this exponential here.", 
    "OK, one final point before I do some more examples.", 
    "This was for VI greater than V0.", 
    "What if VI was less than V0?", 
    "So if VI was less than V0, then the capacitor curve would", 
    "have looked like this.", 
    "So if VI was here, and V0 was here, then the decay would", 
    "have been going in the downward direction.", 
    "And the curve would have looked something like this,", 
    "where VI was the final voltage.", 
    "And of course, if VI was 0, then this would have decayed", 
    "down all the way down to 0 here.", 
    "And I would have had an exponential decay of V0 all", 
    "the way to ground potential.", 
    "In other words, physically if I had a circuit that looked", 
    "like this, if I had a resistor, a capacitor, and I", 
    "had a VI set to 0, I had no source, and somehow I got the", 
    "capacitor with respect to ground with a voltage V0", 
    "across the capacitor, then what that is saying is that", 
    "the capacitor would have an exponential discharge of the", 
    "form V0 e raised to minus d by RC and the final", 
    "value would be 0.", 
    "And so this curve would start off at V0.", 
    "There would be an exponential decay.", 
    "And the final value would be 0.", 
    "And so that would simply show that the capacitor will", 
    "discharge with a time constant RC through the resistor R. So", 
    "I think that's it for this expression and a few other", 
    "examples that I could think of."
