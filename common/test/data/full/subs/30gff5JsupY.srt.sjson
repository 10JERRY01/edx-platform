    "SPEAKER 1: Finally, let me provide some perspective on", 
    "what you've seen so far, in particular on the small signal", 
    "circuit view.", 
    "OK, so recall what we did.", 
    "So in order to find the connection between the small", 
    "signal parameters of the circuit, we replaced all the", 
    "large signal device models with their corresponding small", 
    "signal models.", 
    "But we kept the original circuit the same.", 
    "The topology was exactly the same.", 
    "We didn't change the topology.", 
    "We simply replaced all the large signal models.", 
    "We popped them out and pushed in the new values, the small", 
    "signal values.", 
    "And we then analyzed the resulting", 
    "small signal circuit.", 
    "So for example, this was the large signal circuit of the", 
    "amplifier, and recall that this was the", 
    "small signal circuit.", 
    "OK, they are identical topology, just that I replaced", 
    "the small signal model for the voltage source.", 
    "I replaced a small signal model for the resistor, so on", 
    "and so forth, identical topology.", 
    "The question we ask ourselves is why was this possible?", 
    "You took it on faith from me, and then we went through the", 
    "analysis, but why was this possible?", 
    "So in this last little piece, let me describe and prove to", 
    "you that this was indeed possible, and goes back to and", 
    "comes from the very foundations of circuits.", 
    "You can also go look at section 8..2.1 of the textbook", 
    "to get some more color on this analysis.", 
    "OK, so let's dive into it.", 
    "Let's look at the foundations behind the small signal", 
    "circuit view.", 
    "So note that if I have some circuit, whether it's a large", 
    "signal circuit or a small signal", 
    "circuit, I have some circuit.", 
    "And I apply KVL and KCL to the circuit, some circuit C.", 
    "So when I do that, what I end up with is some equation", 
    "relating the voltages and currents in the circuit.", 
    "So as an example, I might get something", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "I may have some voltage total variable vA.", 
    "I may have some voltage vOUT.", 
    "I may have some voltage vB, and so on and so forth.", 
    "And that would equal to 0.", 
    "So when I apply KVL for instance, I get an equation", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "When I apply KCL, I get sums of currents going to 0.", 
    "So I get a bunch of equations that kind of look like this.", 
    "In this example, it says that our voltages are going to 0.", 
    "Let me mark that out.", 
    "So remember this.", 
    "So this is 1.", 
    "So then, what we did in our analysis was we said, I'm to", 
    "replace my total variables with operating point values", 
    "plus small signal variables.", 
    "In other words, if I have something like VA in our small", 
    "signal method, we said we would replace it with a DC", 
    "offset plus a small signal value.", 
    "Recall that in this equation up here, I applied KVL, KCL,", 
    "so I had a string of equations.", 
    "And in the structure of those equations was captured the", 
    "quality of the circuit, OK?", 
    "So the topology of the circuit was captured in", 
    "those KVL, KCL equations.", 
    "And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to replace the", 
    "total variables with the DC offset and the", 
    "small signal values.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "So I get the same thing as above, just that vA now", 
    "becomes capital VA plus a small va.", 
    "I get a vOUT becomes a capital VOUT plus a small vout, plus", 
    "dot dot dot, plus vB becomes a capital VB plus a small signal", 
    "vb, plus-- and that goes to 0.", 
    "I've changed nothing.", 
    "All I've done is I've simply substituted my total variable", 
    "VA for the sum of a DC value plus a small signal.", 
    "And because KVL, KCL applied, I'm just replacing VA with its", 
    "constituent values.", 
    "No surprise there at all.", 
    "Now notice that the operating point variables--", 
    "there is VA, there's VOUT and VB and so on--", 
    "the operating point variables themselves satisfy the same", 
    "KVL, KCL equation.", 
    "In other words, if I picked capital VI here and so on,", 
    "then if I'd written KVL, KCL for those operating point", 
    "values, then I would have gotten an equation exactly", 
    "like this where VA, VB and so on would have been replaced by", 
    "their operating point values.", 
    "OK, no surprise at all.", 
    "So in fact I can write down VA plus dot dot dot VOUT plus dot", 
    "dot dot plus VB plus dot dot dot equals 0.", 
    "Again, absolutely no surprise.", 
    "The operating point values themselves", 
    "satisfy KVL, KCL equations.", 
    "OK, so you see where I'm headed with this.", 
    "So what I can do now is I can take these operating point", 
    "values, and I can cancel them out from the equation with the", 
    "total variables plus the small signal values.", 
    "In other words, since this is true, I can take this guy,", 
    "this guy, and this guy, and they will independently sum to", 
    "0 because of this equation here.", 
    "So therefore what I can do is I can cancel those out because", 
    "they must all sum to 0.", 
    "So if I cancel them all out and I rewrite the equation,", 
    "what do I get?", 
    "So I've canceled all the operating point values from", 
    "the equation because the operated point values", 
    "themselves satisfy this same KVL, KCL equations.", 
    "So if I cancel those out, what's left?", 
    "I just have the small signal parameters left, and I can", 
    "write those down here.", 
    "So I get va.", 
    "So what else do I have. I have a vout there.", 
    "Keep going here.", 
    "I get vb.", 
    "And that equals 0.", 
    "No surprise at all.", 
    "So let's look at this here.", 
    "Let me call that 2.", 
    "So what have I seen so far?", 
    "So what I've seen is that if I write down KVL, KCL for the", 
    "total variables in the circuit, and the set of", 
    "equations of KVL, KCL capture the connections between the", 
    "elements, capture the topology.", 
    "And then I've just shown you that because the operating", 
    "point values themselves satisfy the same KVL, KCL", 
    "equations, what I'm left with is a set of equations in small", 
    "va, small vb and so on.", 
    "So what's special about this equation?", 
    "So if you look at 1 and 2--", 
    "OK, so look at 1 and 2--", 
    "what do you see?", 
    "2 is simply 1 with the small signal values replacing the", 
    "total variables.", 
    "So 2 here, equation 2--", 
    "that's this equation here--", 
    "is the same equation as 1, as this one here, the same", 
    "equation as 1.", 
    "But where the small signal values have", 
    "replaced the total variables.", 
    "2 is exactly the same as 1, but the small signal values", 
    "have replaced the total variables, and so therefore 2", 
    "must reflect the same topology as in C, except that the small", 
    "signal models have been used.", 
    "In other words, these equations have the exact same", 
    "form as these equations, just that each of the total", 
    "variables have been replaced with their corresponding small", 
    "signal variables.", 
    "And because this set of equations captured exactly", 
    "this topology, then this set of equations too must capture", 
    "exactly the same topology.", 
    "OK, so the topologies are therefore identical.", 
    "And so 2 must reflect the same topology as C, and just that", 
    "the small signal circuit models have been used in place", 
    "of the large signal circuit models.", 
    "OK, so that's a proof.", 
    "So that says that the small signal circuit will have", 
    "exactly the same topology as above, and I can simply", 
    "replace the large signal elements with their small", 
    "signal values, with the small signal elements, and simply", 
    "continue an analysis with the small signal element models.", 
    "So this is the key here."
