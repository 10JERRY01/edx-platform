    "SPEAKER 1: All right.", 
    "What am I doing here?", 
    "I'm trying to build up to something that we will call an", 
    "impedance model, and our goal is to see, can we strike out", 
    "here and try an even simpler way to get VP than even our", 
    "sneaky method?", 
    "And we got some insight that VP kind of looked like a", 
    "voltage divider relationship with respect to VI.", 
    "So let's take a look at some of our components and explore", 
    "further if we can try to get to the bottom of this.", 
    "So let's take a resister here.", 
    "And suppose my current IR is given by some IR e raised to", 
    "st. So let's have an exponential drive.", 
    "S, as usual, is a shorthand for j omega.", 
    "I'm going to keep saying this so we don't", 
    "lose sight of that.", 
    "It is a shorthand.", 
    "In future courses, you will see that S will take on a", 
    "significant meaning in and of itself, but for 6.002X, just", 
    "assume it's a shorthand.", 
    "So IR is some current.", 
    "It has got some complex amplitude, and it's of the", 
    "form e raised to st.", 
    "So we know from the last sequence that the response to", 
    "e raised to st is also of the form e raised to st. So we", 
    "know that VR is also going to be of the form VR e raised to", 
    "st. OK, So we know from the last sequence that the", 
    "response to e raised to st is also of the form e raised to", 
    "st.", 
    "So if IR is IR e raised to st, then my VR is going to be VR e", 
    "raised to st.", 
    "So let's write down our usual Ohm's Law relationship.", 
    "So I know that VR is IR.", 
    "This is our basic device relationship.", 
    "And so I substitute my complex values here,", 
    "my exponential drives.", 
    "So I get VR e raised to st. And that is equal to R IR e", 
    "raised to st.", 
    "All I've done here is I have Ohm's Law.", 
    "My device relationship, VR equals IR, here.", 
    "So I've simply substituted these to IR and VR forms of", 
    "the current and voltages in here.", 
    "And I want to cancel out e raised to st from both sides,", 
    "and what am I left with?", 
    "I'm left with VR equals R IR.", 
    "So notice that VR and IR are complex amplitudes These are", 
    "complex amplitudes.", 
    "They multiply e raised to st.", 
    "So what is interesting is that it says, if my voltages and", 
    "currents are of the form e raised to st, then the complex", 
    "amplitudes of the current and voltage for the capacitor are", 
    "also related by an Ohm's Law-like relation.", 
    "Let's write that down.", 
    "Let me just write that clearly.", 
    "So let me repeat that.", 
    "That's extremely important.", 
    "It says, I have a device relationship VR equals R IR.", 
    "This is this part here.", 
    "And it says that if I have a current and voltage of the", 
    "form e raised to st, where capital V, small R, and", 
    "capital I, small R are the complex amplitudes of the", 
    "current and voltage respectively, then it says", 
    "that the complex amplitudes are themselves related", 
    "according to Ohm's Law.", 
    "So by the generalization of Ohm's Law, my complex", 
    "amplitudes are also related according to Ohm's Law.", 
    "So that's for resistors.", 
    "What happens with a capacitor?", 
    "Let's take a look at something similar for a capacitor.", 
    "And this is where you will see the first glimmerings of the", 
    "aha moment.", 
    "So this is where you will see the first glimmer of some", 
    "really, really exciting stuff.", 
    "This is just absolutely magical.", 
    "So let's say for the capacitor, we also assume", 
    "exponential forms of voltages and currents.", 
    "So let's say my current is of the form IC e raised to st,", 
    "where IC is a complex amplitude.", 
    "And we know from the previous sequence that my voltages will", 
    "also have the same form, e raised to st. So my voltage", 
    "will be of the form e raised to st as well.", 
    "Notice this was the beauty of complex exponential, the", 
    "beauty of exponential e raised to st, where once I introduced", 
    "e raised to st into my differential equations that I", 
    "got e raised to st everywhere.", 
    "And this was true for linear circuits.", 
    "So my voltages and currents are of the form e raised to", 
    "st.", 
    "So now, let's see what happens.", 
    "Let us see what happens.", 
    "Watch out.", 
    "Watch for the shining sun, OK?", 
    "Watch for the light now.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Get ready.", 
    "IC equals C DVC dt.", 
    "We notice, this is the device relationship for a capacitor.", 
    "IC is C DVC dt.", 
    "Now let me go and substitute the forms of the current IC e", 
    "raised to st in place of IC here.", 
    "What do I get?", 
    "IC e raised to st equals C DVC dt.", 
    "So let me substitute VC e raised to st in here.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "If I differentiate VC e raised to st, I get VC times S e", 
    "raised to st.", 
    "So I can then cancel out e raised to st from both sides,", 
    "and what am I left with?", 
    "I am left with IC equals C VC S. Or if I shuffle things", 
    "around, VC equals 1 divided by SC times IC.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Ready for the glimmer here?", 
    "You're seeing it.", 
    "OK, what's happened here?", 
    "Here, my IC and VC were related as C DVC dt.", 
    "But when I replaced VC with its exponential form, notice", 
    "that my VC, the complex amplitude of the voltage, got", 
    "related to the complex amplitude of the current by", 
    "some relationship that did not involve any differentiation.", 
    "In fact, if I call this ZC, what do I get?", 
    "I get VC equals ZC IC.", 
    "In other words, the complex amplitudes are related", 
    "like V equals IR.", 
    "Isn't that amazing?", 
    "This is a sliver of sunshine that you see here, that says", 
    "when I use complex amplitudes, when I use e raised to st,", 
    "these kinds of exponential forms of currents, then it", 
    "appears that the complex amplitudes of the current and", 
    "voltages seem to be related to each other by a generalization", 
    "of Ohm's Law.", 
    "Let me write that down.", 
    "Just dwell on it for a little while longer.", 
    "This is just absolutely spectacular.", 
    "So here we see that even for the capacitor, I have a V", 
    "equals IR kind of relationship between the voltages and the", 
    "currents, where Z, which is 1 divided by SC for the", 
    "capacitor, that Z is a generalization of resistance,", 
    "and it's called impedance.", 
    "It's a generalization of resistance, and it's given by", 
    "1 by SC for the capacitor.", 
    "And that is called an impedance.", 
    "So when I generalize to an impedance model, I discover", 
    "that even for inductors and capacitors, where previously I", 
    "had things like DVC dt, and LDI dt and so floating around,", 
    "we're going to find that their complex amplitudes for", 
    "exponential drives are going to related algebraically as VC", 
    "equals ZC IC.", 
    "Absolutely unbelievable.", 
    "Well, let's go ahead and confirm", 
    "the same for an inductor.", 
    "And then very quickly after that, from this little glimmer", 
    "of hope where hopefully you can begin to believe that some", 
    "kind of a voltage divider relationship should be", 
    "possible very soon, you should begin to just completely", 
    "believe that shortly.", 
    "Lets go take a look at inductors.", 
    "So if you look at an inductor here, what do we see?", 
    "Let's see if we can find a similar", 
    "generalization for the inductor.", 
    "And I have an inductor with inductance L, current IL and", 
    "voltage VL.", 
    "So Let's say, as is our usual practice, IL is of the", 
    "exponential form.", 
    "So it's some IL e raised to st.", 
    "And we know that the voltage will be of a similar form, VL", 
    "e raised to st. And we also for the inductor that the", 
    "voltage across the inductor is related to L DIL dt.", 
    "What I'd like to do is I'd like you to go ahead and find", 
    "out this generalization of Ohm's Law for yourselves, and", 
    "try to figure out what that will look like.", 
    "I want you to find out what VL is going to look like.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And I'll give you a clue.", 
    "VL is going to look like some impedance times IL.", 
    "I will give you an exercise next so you can go and try it", 
    "out for yourselves before I go and work out the answer next."
