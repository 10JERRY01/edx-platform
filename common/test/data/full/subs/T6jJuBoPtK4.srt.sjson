    "SPEAKER 1: All right, so to do\nKCL at e2, let&#39;s start with", 
    "the current leaving this node.", 
    "Remember, my usual habit\nis to sum the", 
    "nodes leaving the node.", 
    "So the current heading in this\ndirection will be e2 minus e1", 
    "divided by R3.", 
    "So current going left from that\nnode will be e2 minus e1", 
    "divided by R3 or multiplied\nby G3.", 
    "Then the current going up will\nbe e2 minus V0 times G4.", 
    "And the current leaving the\nnode and going down", 
    "will be e2 times G5.", 
    "Have I missed anything?", 
    "Aha, there is a current here\nthat&#39;s coming into the node.", 
    "And so therefore, the current\nleaving the mode is minus I1.", 
    "And all of that sums\nup to zero.", 
    "There you have it.", 
    "So I&#39;ve written KCL\nfor the two nodes.", 
    "And I&#39;ve substituted the device\nlaws as I&#39;ve been", 
    "writing it so I don&#39;t have this", 
    "intermediate current variable.", 
    "So just stare at the\nbeauty of this.", 
    "Notice that I have two\nequations, one and two, and I", 
    "have two variables, e1 and e2,\ntwo unknowns and two equations", 
    "and that&#39;s it.", 
    "OK, so let me go on to step\nfour of the node method.", 
    "The step four of the node method\nis simply to go ahead", 
    "and solve for the node\nvoltages, e1 and e2.", 
    "So I have my two equations which\nreflect the KCL at node", 
    "e1 and KCL at e2.", 
    "So now it&#39;s simply juggling it\non with some math and trying", 
    "to collect all the coefficients\nof e1 and those", 
    "of e2, collect them\nall and just write", 
    "them a little cleanly.", 
    "So let me move all the\nconstant terms to the", 
    "right-hand side.", 
    "And I will move the variables,\nor the unknowns, to the", 
    "left-hand hand side.", 
    "So let me start with e1.", 
    "So notice that e1, I multiplied\nby G1, so", 
    "I write that down.", 
    "Multiply by G3, so I\nwrite that down.", 
    "And multiply by G2, so I\nwrite that down too.", 
    "So I get e1 times G1\nplus G3 plus G2.", 
    "And then I collect\nthe terms in e2.", 
    "And there&#39;s only one here,\nwhich is minus G3.", 
    "And the constant terms\nare here, V0 G1.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to move that to\nthe right-hand side and write", 
    "that down as V0 G1.", 
    "For the next set of steps, I\ngo ahead and do e1 for the", 
    "next equation.", 
    "I get minus G3.", 
    "And then for e2, I go ahead and\nget a G5, and I get a G4,", 
    "and I get a G3.", 
    "So it&#39;s G3, G4, and a G5.", 
    "And I can move the constant\nterms, which is V0 G4, and I", 
    "want the right-hand side.", 
    "And in this case, they both\nbecome positive as they move", 
    "to the right.", 
    "And I get a I1 here.", 
    "Good, there you go.", 
    "So I end up with two equations\nand two unknowns.", 
    "And notice I have by e1 times\nsomething plus e2 times", 
    "something equals a constant.", 
    "And then again, that e1 times\nsomething plus e2 times", 
    "something is another constant.", 
    "So I two equations\nand two unknowns.", 
    "And see how remarkably\nsimple this is.", 
    "This is basic high school\nmath to solve a pair of", 
    "simultaneous equations in\norder to get the answer.", 
    "And just to be a complete here,\nlet me go ahead and", 
    "complete it for you.", 
    "So supposing in step four number\nfour you&#39;ve gone and", 
    "solved for the node method, and\nby solving the node method", 
    "you get the values\nof e1 and e2.", 
    "So let&#39;s say you&#39;ve gone and\nsolved the simultaneous", 
    "equations for step four and\nyou have e1 and e2.", 
    "Then, to complete your circuit\nanalysis you need to find the", 
    "branch voltages.", 
    "And so you can go ahead and find\nall the v-i&#39;s and i-i&#39;s.", 
    "So in this case, one of my\nbranch voltages is v1 i1.", 
    "So I just do a couple of quick\nexamples just to show you that", 
    "it&#39;s pretty simple.", 
    "So what is v1 here?", 
    "Well let me pause and\nhave you do it.",
