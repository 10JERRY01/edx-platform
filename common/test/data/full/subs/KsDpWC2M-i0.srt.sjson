    "SPEAKER 1: Before we run off\nand start building a lumped", 
    "circuit abstraction, it is\nworthwhile at this point to", 
    "spend a few minutes thinking\nabout what assumptions we", 
    "really have to make\nin order to create", 
    "these lumped circuits.", 
    "So recall, we took these lumped\nelements and modeled", 
    "them by their V-I relation, and\nwe defined a V and an I", 
    "for each element.", 
    "In general, we just cannot\ngo around doing that.", 
    "That seems like a huge\nsimplification, and in", 
    "general, that is not true.", 
    "So it turns out that we have\nto make some pretty", 
    "substantial assumptions in\norder to make that true.", 
    "And I&#39;d like to spend this next\nsegment to discuss that.", 
    "So for a light bulb filament\nexample, for instance, we", 
    "defined a V-I relation\nfor that.", 
    "And we need to understand\nunder what", 
    "conditions is that true.", 
    "Now in general, for circuits\nthat we will build in this", 
    "course, we won&#39;t argue during\neach of those building", 
    "experiments whether the\nassumptions are true or not.", 
    "But it&#39;s really worthwhile for\nus to spend some time right at", 
    "the beginning of this course\nto make sure that at least", 
    "this first time, our abstraction\nis reasonable.", 
    "And then for future times,\nwe will simply", 
    "assume that it&#39;s true.", 
    "So in this case, ensuring that\nour abstraction is reasonable", 
    "is tantamount to making sure\nthat the V and I that we have", 
    "defined for the element\nare valid.", 
    "There&#39;s a V here and an I here\nthat we have defined for the", 
    "element, and I need to be sure\nthat those two are truly", 
    "defined in a unique manner\nfor the element.", 
    "So let me start with looking at\nthe same filament, and look", 
    "at under what conditions\nI might be defined.", 
    "Let me do a quick segue into one\nother quick thought that", 
    "came to my mind, which is as\nyou progress to the rest of", 
    "6.002, you really won&#39;t need a\nlot of this material that we", 
    "will cover in the next few\nminutes to understand what", 
    "must really be true for us to\nmake this lumped circuit", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "However, many years later as\nengineers when you build", 
    "systems, you might happen upon\nsome circuit or some element", 
    "which may not quite behave the\nway you think it should be.", 
    "And it could well be that the\nmaterial in this segment might", 
    "come to your rescue and explain\nexactly why it is that", 
    "the circuit is not behaving\nlike you want it to.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So going back to our light bulb,\nI&#39;m going to look at", 
    "what kind of assumptions we have\nto make in order for the", 
    "current I to be uniquely\ndefined.", 
    "So let me just call the\nsurface here SA,", 
    "and call this SB.", 
    "And so I will be uniquely\ndefined if the I going into SA", 
    "is equal to the current\ncoming out of SB.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So let&#39;s say if I have some\ncurrent going into SA here,", 
    "then I will be uniquely defined\nif the current coming", 
    "out of SB is the same as the\ncurrent going into SA.", 
    "OK, so let&#39;s take a look\nat what must be", 
    "true for that to happen.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to start by putting\na little black box", 
    "around this filament, so I can\nlook at the total amount of", 
    "current coming in and apply\nMaxwell&#39;s equations to figure", 
    "out under what conditions\nthe I going in equals", 
    "the I coming out.", 
    "So recall, I have built this\nlittle box for myself around", 
    "the light bulb, and I&#39;m going\nto call the current going in", 
    "IA, and the current\ncoming out IB.", 
    "And SA is the A surface\nand SB is the B", 
    "surface of my filament.", 
    "Now I also know that IA is given\nby integral over SA,", 
    "J.dS and IB is given-- integral\nover SB, J.dS, where", 
    "J is the current density and\nI&#39;ve just integrated over the", 
    "SA and SB surfaces to\nget the current.", 
    "So as I said earlier, my\ncurrent, I, is uniquely", 
    "defined if I can show\nthat IA equals IB.", 
    "In that case, my current, I,\nwill be uniquely defined.", 
    "So let me give you the result,\nand then I&#39;ll show you", 
    "how to derive it.", 
    "I will be uniquely defined for\nthe element only if dq by dt", 
    "is zero for the filament.", 
    "Del q by del t here is the\nrate of change of charge,", 
    "where the charge q is the charge\ninside the box here.", 
    "So I make the claim initially\nthat the current is uniquely", 
    "defined only if del q by del t\nequals 0 for the filament.", 
    "So how do we get that?", 
    "So from Maxwell&#39;s equations, we\nknow that integral SA J.dS", 
    "for the current going in, minus\nthe integral over SB", 
    "J.dS equals del q by del t.", 
    "So what I&#39;ve simply written\nhere is one of Maxwell&#39;s", 
    "equations, which says that the\ntotal amount of current going", 
    "into some closed surface is\nrelated to the rate of change", 
    "of charge within the volume\ncontained by the surface.", 
    "So in this case, it is integral\nJ.dS over SA minus", 
    "integral J.dS over SB, equals\ndel q by del t.", 
    "So this component here is IA and\nthis component here is IB.", 
    "Now IA will equal IB, only if\ndel q by del t equals 0.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So IA will equal IB only\nif del q by del t is 0.", 
    "But in general, del q by del\nt doesn&#39;t have to be 0.", 
    "There&#39;s no reason why, for some\ncomponent that I pick up,", 
    "that the del q by del\nt is going to be 0.", 
    "I have no way of knowing that.", 
    "So does this mean that\nwe are in trouble?", 
    "Are we stuck?", 
    "We seem to be stuck, because\nI wanted to show that I was", 
    "defined for the element, and for\nI to be defined, IA must", 
    "equal IB, because the current\ngoing in must equal the", 
    "current going out.", 
    "But I&#39;ve just shown that the\ndifference of these currents,", 
    "IA minus IB, is del\nq by del t.", 
    "But that doesn&#39;t have\nto be 0, in general.", 
    "So it looks like we are\nin deep trouble.", 
    "So what do we do here?", 
    "I&#39;m going to pause for a few\nseconds, while I give you some", 
    "time to think about what might\nbe a trick that you can use.", 
    "This might be one of the most\npowerful tricks that we have", 
    "made in our EECS field, that\nhas enabled us to build", 
    "really, really interesting\nsystems in a", 
    "really simple manner.",
