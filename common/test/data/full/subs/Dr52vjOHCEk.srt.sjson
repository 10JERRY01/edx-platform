    "SPEAKER 1: In this sequence, we\nare going to do something", 
    "pretty spectacular.", 
    "We are going to discretize\nvalue.", 
    "Think of it as lumping value.", 
    "Much like we discretized matter\nand created the lumped", 
    "matter discipline, which gave\nrise to just a spectacular", 
    "lump circuit abstraction that\nenabled us to replace", 
    "complicated Maxwell&#39;s equations\nwith very simple", 
    "algebra, in the sequence we will\nlook at how discretizing", 
    "values will yield the\ndigital abstraction.", 
    "This will give us the next\nhuge lead in simplicity.", 
    "It is also really interesting\nto point out that all the", 
    "tools that you&#39;ve learned in\nthe previous sequences are", 
    "sufficient to analyze simple\ndigital circuits.", 
    "Let me remind you that the\nreading for the digital", 
    "abstraction is chapter five.", 
    "In general, you should look\nto reading the text.", 
    "It&#39;s available as e-text, or you\ncan get a copy as well in", 
    "paper from stores.", 
    "And within there, you can look\nat not only the content of the", 
    "book, but at the end of each\nchapter, there are exercises", 
    "and problems that are in\naddition to those that are", 
    "given to you in the\nonline course.", 
    "So let&#39;s get right down to it.", 
    "And let&#39;s start by trying to\nunderstand why go digital.", 
    "We already have the\nanalog world.", 
    "We understand how to\nbuild circuits.", 
    "So what do we gain\nby going digital?", 
    "So let&#39;s try to motivate trying\nto do the whole digital", 
    "thing before we really get down\nto the digital business.", 
    "So let me do an example.", 
    "In this example, notice that I\nhave a little circuit, very", 
    "similar to ones that\nyou&#39;ve seen before.", 
    "It has two voltage sources\nwith voltages V1 and V2.", 
    "And they&#39;re connected by\na pair of resistances.", 
    "And I take the output point\nbetween the two resistances,", 
    "and my output is V0.", 
    "Now, V1 and V2 here might\nrepresent a couple of outputs", 
    "of a couple of sensors.", 
    "So for instance, you may be\nmeasuring some voltages or", 
    "voltages related to, perhaps,\nsome stresses and strains of", 
    "materials, or whatever.", 
    "And for some reason, let&#39;s\nsay you want to", 
    "add up the two voltages.", 
    "And I need to build some circuit\nto try to do some", 
    "processing on those voltages.", 
    "So what we&#39;re gonna do is first\nlook at what this little", 
    "analog signal processing does,\nand then we&#39;ll go and see why", 
    "we may have a problem here.", 
    "Before we begin, I want to\nshow you a really quick", 
    "shorthand notation.", 
    "In this shorthand notation for\nthe circuit on the left hand", 
    "side, notice that I have the two\nsources just like before.", 
    "But what I&#39;ve done is in the\nnote method, recall, you", 
    "usually pick a ground node.", 
    "And one of the techniques I&#39;ve\nsuggested in picking a ground", 
    "node was to pick the node with\na majority of the elements", 
    "connected to it, or to pick a\nground node based on one where", 
    "many off the sources had\none of the terminals", 
    "connected to it.", 
    "So in this case, notice that\nboth my sources have their", 
    "negative terminals connected to\nthis common node down here.", 
    "So I want to pick that\nis my ground node.", 
    "Notice that the same node here\nis also the node from which", 
    "the output voltage,\nV0, is referenced.", 
    "And so I&#39;m going to draw a\nground there, as well.", 
    "So this is a shorthand\nnotation.", 
    "And the two circuits are\ncompletely identical.", 
    "And the grounds here and the\nshorthand for the output", 
    "simply reflects our node\nmethod shorthand.", 
    "So let&#39;s get started.", 
    "So here&#39;s my circuit on the left\nhand side, where I have", 
    "taken the shortcut of showing\nyou just the ground nodes and", 
    "the output with respect\nto the ground node.", 
    "Here I can draw the ground\nif you like.", 
    "But when you just see a output\nV0 referenced, that means that", 
    "that is the node voltage and it\nis referenced with respect", 
    "to the ground, wherever the\nground is in that circuit.", 
    "And this is true even if I had\nnot shown you this little", 
    "ground node right here.", 
    "So let&#39;s try to understand,\nfirst, what this circuit is", 
    "doing for us.", 
    "So before I go ahead and do the\nanalysis for you, you now", 
    "have your tool chest. I&#39;d like\nyou to go and think about what", 
    "the output V0 looks like, and\ngive you a few seconds to", 
    "think through it.", 
    "And then I will solve\nit for you myself.",
