    "SPEAKER: All right, so as promised I'm going to start", 
    "with the usual way of trying to solve our little circuit.", 
    "The usual way was the", 
    "differential equation approach.", 
    "And as I promised, it is going to be hard.", 
    "So I'll put this little icon here just so we understand it", 
    "is going to be hard.", 
    "So don't worry about it.", 
    "So you recall there were four steps that we followed in the", 
    "past to solve such circuits in the usual way.", 
    "We start by setting up a differential equation.", 
    "Then we find the particular solution vp.", 
    "Then we find the homogeneous solution vH.", 
    "And then we find the total solution in our case v by", 
    "summing up the particular and the homogeneous solutions.", 
    "And then finally, we would solve for the unknowns using", 
    "the initial conditions.", 
    "So this was a usual four-step method.", 
    "So let's stride down this path and see what we run into in", 
    "order to solve the circuit for a sinusoid.", 
    "So here's our circuit.", 
    "Our goal is to find v of t.", 
    "And recall that our input has been given to us as vi of", 
    "cosine of omega t.", 
    "And we're looking to find a solution for t greater than or", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "And we are told that v for time t equal to 0", 
    "is given to be 0.", 
    "So the first step, as is our usual practice, let's set up", 
    "the differential equation.", 
    "And we set up the differential equation, applying our", 
    "workhorse, the node method.", 
    "So this node a voltage v. Let me pick with respect to those", 
    "ground node.", 
    "So let me sum up the currents leaving the node, and that", 
    "should equate to 0.", 
    "So the current leaving the node in this direction is v", 
    "minus vI divided by R. And the current heading down this", 
    "direction is C dv dt.", 
    "This capacitance is C, so this is C dv by dt.", 
    "And the currents must sum to 0 by the node method.", 
    "So let me just multiply the whole thing, both sides by R,", 
    "and shuffle things around.", 
    "So I get RC dv dt.", 
    "Plus v minus vI equals 0.", 
    "So what I want to do is move vI to the right-hand side and", 
    "write it like this.", 
    "And then I've given that Vi is Vi cosine of omega t.", 
    "There you go, that wasn't too bad.", 
    "It's a very simple circuit.", 
    "So setting up the differential equation wasn't too painful.", 
    "There I have it.", 
    "So now I am ready for the second step, which is to find", 
    "the particular solution to the sinusoid vp."
