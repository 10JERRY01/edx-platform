    "SPEAKER: So you've seen that if I have excursions of vI", 
    "between here and here, I will see excursions of v0 between", 
    "here and here.", 
    "My bias point is picked to be this point.", 
    "Now, notice that the gain and the distance of excursion of", 
    "the signal above the load line really depends a lot on where", 
    "I pick the bias point.", 
    "So how do you really go ahead and choose the bias point?", 
    "There are really two key parts here.", 
    "Let me just write them down, one and two.", 
    "The first one is that the gain of my amplifier is going to be", 
    "dependent on my choice of bias point.", 
    "We'll see that in a second.", 
    "And second, the total input swing, the total distance of", 
    "excursions of the input and the corresponding output, also", 
    "is determined by the choice of bias point.", 
    "Let's look at each of these things in turn.", 
    "So let me start by writing the equation for the small signal", 
    "output v0 as a function of VI.", 
    "And this is given by minus K, VI, the DC bias input, VT, RL,", 
    "and the small signal vi where this is gm.", 
    "Now, notice here that the bias point really controls the", 
    "gain, because the gain is really gmRL.", 
    "Notice that this is gm.", 
    "So if you look at the small signal output v0, it is", 
    "related to gm times RL times vi.", 
    "In other words, this is related to a product, the", 
    "product of gm, RL, and vi.", 
    "So I can write that down as minus gm, RL, vi where gm is K", 
    "times VI minus VT.", 
    "So notice that my gain is gmRL and that that", 
    "is related to VI.", 
    "So what that is saying is that if I pick a bias point that", 
    "that has a higher VI than I chose here.", 
    "So let's say I pick a bias this point here, which", 
    "has a higher VI.", 
    "This is a higher VI than chosen here.", 
    "The gain is going to be higher.", 
    "In other words, the excursions of my input are going to", 
    "exercise a larger portion of the load line than if I chose", 
    "a bias point with a smaller VI.", 
    "So here, for the larger VI, I get a larger gain.", 
    "So my gmRL is related to VI.", 
    "So as I choose a bias point with a larger VI--", 
    "a larger bias voltage--", 
    "my gain is going to increase.", 
    "And of course, correspondingly, if I pick a", 
    "bias point with a smaller value of VI, my gain is going", 
    "to be smaller.", 
    "The excursions are going to be a whole lot smaller.", 
    "They're going to go from here to here, which is certainly", 
    "smaller than the excursions from here to here.", 
    "So I can choose the gain of my amplifier by choosing the bias", 
    "point appropriately.", 
    "So clearly, the bias point influences the gain, so", 
    "therefore, the number one reason for picking the bias", 
    "point will be my gain.", 
    "So let's write that down very quickly.", 
    "So let's say more gain here and less gain here.", 
    "So that's the first influence on my choice of bias point", 
    "that relates to the gain.", 
    "The second thing is input swing.", 
    "Now, notice that when I pick a bias point here, my input can", 
    "swing between this point and this point.", 
    "What if I pick my bias point here?", 
    "What happens?", 
    "If I pick my bias point there, of course, I get more gain.", 
    "But I run into trouble.", 
    "The excursions tend to be big, but they now want to go into", 
    "the triode region.", 
    "So as soon as my excursions cross the boundary of the", 
    "triode region, I run into massive distortion.", 
    "So a larger input swing cannot be tolerated when I pick this", 
    "bias point.", 
    "Notice that for lower inputs, if my input is lower, VI is", 
    "lower, I'm OK.", 
    "But as VI goes larger, I run into trouble because I run", 
    "into this region here.", 
    "So if I want symmetric input swing, then I cannot go way", 
    "high up here.", 
    "So let me write that down--", 
    "and symmetry.", 
    "So if I want a symmetric input swing, that is an input swing", 
    "that can go as far negative as it can go positive, then I", 
    "need to pick a bias point that allows me a region of", 
    "operation in the saturation region.", 
    "If I go too high up like here, I do not get symmetric inputs", 
    "swings, because for positive input swings, I run into", 
    "distortion because I go into the triode regions.", 
    "The same thing is true for when I go to a very", 
    "low value of VI.", 
    "For a very low value of VI, the same thing happens.", 
    "If I go way low, close to a low value-- very, very low,", 
    "like a 0-volt value for VI, even there, very close to VT", 
    "for instance, I cannot have my VI going below VT.", 
    "So again, I run into asymmetric voltage swings.", 
    "So if I want a low-gain amplifier--", 
    "a very low gain down here--", 
    "I still cannot go very close to VT.", 
    "My VI goes below VT, I get cut off.", 
    "So two major, major rules that govern how I pick my bias", 
    "point, my gain--", 
    "and that relates to gmRL where gm is K times VI minus VT.", 
    "And then the second important thing is my input swing.", 
    "If I need to be able to support large inputs, then I", 
    "better pick a bias point that is closer to the midpoint", 
    "between my valid input values.", 
    "In other words, if I want a large input swing, in other", 
    "words, my maximum input swing is between", 
    "these two points here.", 
    "So if I wanted the largest input swing, then I would pick", 
    "my bias point here for the largest input swing.", 
    "If I want a high gain, then I would go higher up, but I", 
    "would not get a maximum input swing.", 
    "So there's a trade off that I have to adhere to.", 
    "So there's a gain issue, and there's an input swing issue,", 
    "and that's how I pick my bias point.", 
    "So summarized very quickly, a bias point is selected based", 
    "on the following.", 
    "I select my gain, I pick the bias point based on the gain", 
    "that I want, and then I need to also", 
    "look at my input swing.", 
    "And for a symmetric input swing, I need to be sure that", 
    "my input can articulate the curve both equally in the", 
    "negative direction and the positive direction about the", 
    "bias point.", 
    "So these are a couple of principles that will help you", 
    "choose your bias point."
