    "SPEAKER 1: So far, we&#39;ve gotten\naway with this abstract", 
    "little switch, which\nenabled us to build", 
    "all kinds of gates.", 
    "NOR gates and NAND gates and\nall kinds of fun stuff.", 
    "By the way, remember that once\nyou can build these inverted", 
    "gates, you can always build\nnon-inverted gates.", 
    "So for example, suppose you\nhad a NAND gate, you could", 
    "turn that into an AND gate by", 
    "connecting to it to an inverter.", 
    "And you would end up\nwith an AND gate.", 
    "So that would be simple enough,\nwhere you connected", 
    "the output off the NAND gate to\nthe inverter and inverted", 
    "it, that would give\nyou an AND gate.", 
    "So fundamentally, once we have\nthis magical abstract switch,", 
    "we can build all kinds\nof gates, and life", 
    "becomes really nice.", 
    "Our challenge is, how do we get\nthis physical device that", 
    "will behave like a switch.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So now, let&#39;s learn about\nthis physical device.", 
    "And one such device-- and\nthere&#39;s many possibilities.", 
    "But the one that is in common\nuse and has been in common use", 
    "for almost 30 years--", 
    "I remember doing some designs\nusing MOSFET devices, which is", 
    "what we&#39;ll talk about, in 1981\nin the Tata Institute of", 
    "Fundamental Research\nin Bombay.", 
    "So they were doing designs with\ngates in the solid state", 
    "electronics group at TIFR\nin Bombay in India.", 
    "So these devices have been\naround for a long time.", 
    "And virtually all of our\nmicroprocessors and chips", 
    "today are built using these\ndevices called MOSFETS.", 
    "So they&#39;ve been in use for 30,\n40 years and are still hugely,", 
    "hugely popular today.", 
    "So MOSFET device is what you\nwill use to build this magical", 
    "switch of ours.", 
    "So MOSFET stands for Metal-Oxide\nSemiconductor", 
    "Field-Effect Transistor.", 
    "And we will look at what\nthis device really,", 
    "really looks like.", 
    "And as I said earlier, today&#39;s\nmicroprocessors, like the ones", 
    "you might find inside your\nlaptop, or the kind of", 
    "microprocessors you might find\nin your cell phones, might", 
    "contain close to a billion\nof these MOSFET devices.", 
    "In fact, in many cases, they\ncould be on the order of 10&#39;s", 
    "of billions of these MOSFET\ndevices, all acting like", 
    "switches and connected together\nto create these gates", 
    "that we&#39;ve talked about.", 
    "And so, all these gates coupled\ntogether give rise to", 
    "all the logical functions and\ninteresting things that we can", 
    "build, such as smartphones, or\nthings like mice, and amazing", 
    "electronic devices like\nsupercomputers, and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "So what does a MOSFET\nlook like?", 
    "Well, it is a three terminal\nlumped element, and it behaves", 
    "like a switch.", 
    "OK.", 
    "A switch has three elements.", 
    "Remember, we talked about the\ncontrol port, the control", 
    "terminal, the input,\nand the output.", 
    "So MOSFET is a three terminal\nlumped element and behaves", 
    "like a switch.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let&#39;s draw that out.", 
    "So the MOSFET looks like this.", 
    "The symbol for the MOSFET\nlooks like this", 
    "So this is called D. It&#39;s\ncalled the drain.", 
    "The terminal below here\nis called the", 
    "source, or S for short.", 
    "And this terminal is\ncalled G for gate.", 
    "OK, this is similar to our\nswitch, where we had this", 
    "little pattern here.", 
    "And it controls C, and\ninput, and output.", 
    "So the MOSFET has terminals D,\nS, and G, much like a switch&#39;s", 
    "in, out, and C. And so, we won&#39;t\ngo into details of why", 
    "this terminal is called a\ndrain, gate, and source.", 
    "But you should feel free to and\ncheck out the textbook in", 
    "chapter 6.7 if you want to\nunderstand more details about", 
    "what transistors really look\nlike on the inside.", 
    "So a transistor has a MOSFET\ndevice, which is a Metal-Oxide", 
    "Semiconductor Field-Effect\nTransistor.", 
    "They are often called a MOSFET\nfor short, and sometimes", 
    "called a transistor for short.", 
    "It has three terminals,\nG, D, and S. G is", 
    "called the control terminal.", 
    "That&#39;s where, much like a\nswitch, you apply high value", 
    "with respect to the\nsource, and the", 
    "MOSFET behaves one way.", 
    "And then, you apply a low value\nwith respect to the", 
    "source, it behaves\na different rate.", 
    "And we&#39;ll look at that in\nmore detail shortly.", 
    "The drain and source are\nlike the input and", 
    "output for a switch.", 
    "And for the purposes of 6002x,\nthe drain and source are", 
    "largely going to behave\nin a symmetric manner.", 
    "In general, the physics\nhas different", 
    "behavior for the MOSFET.", 
    "But for our needs, let&#39;s just\nassume that they behave in a",
