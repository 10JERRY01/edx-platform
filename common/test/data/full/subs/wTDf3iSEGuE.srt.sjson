    "PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL: So I have a little switch here, and", 
    "using that switch, I'm going to switch in this little", 
    "resistance.", 
    "Whoa!", 
    "What on Earth is happening out there?", 
    "This is so much fun.", 
    "So what I did is I switched in the small resistor here to", 
    "decrease the time constant.", 
    "But it looks like I got a whole bunch of crapola that I", 
    "did not bargain for.", 
    "So this is certainly very fast. It goes up really fast,", 
    "but I just can't--", 
    "you know, I'm not sure where it's going, though.", 
    "Let's stare at that a little while longer.", 
    "Let me expand the time scale for you.", 
    "Look at this.", 
    "So you have a nice little smooth thing going up.", 
    "I get something that looks like this.", 
    "It's something like a sinusoid.", 
    "It looks like sinusoidal, but then, it's a sinusoid that", 
    "kind of gives up and kind of gets tired and kind of goes", 
    "away, right?", 
    "Zzzzz, i it kind of dies out.", 
    "So nothing that you learned so far has prepared you for this.", 
    "And trust me, when I first got into--", 
    "did some circuit designs myself a long, long time ago,", 
    "I got nailed by that.", 
    "I've looked at my circuit.", 
    "And what ended up happening was I was looking at--", 
    "I was noticing these sharp lines at all my transitions.", 
    "When I looked at my scope, I expected to see a nice little", 
    "square wave, but I saw these nasty", 
    "spikes sitting out there.", 
    "And then when I stared at it more carefully, those spikes", 
    "are really sinusoids that seem to kind of get tired and kind", 
    "of go away.", 
    "So those are nasty, those are real, and they", 
    "happen all the time.", 
    "And what we'll do today is try to get into that and", 
    "understand why that's the case.", 
    "We'll understand how to design that away.", 
    "And that's a real problem, by the way.", 
    "And the reason that's a real problem is the following.", 
    "Look at this.", 
    "Look down here.", 
    "So because this intermediate voltage is meandering all over", 
    "the countryside here, at this particular point, the", 
    "intermediate voltage dips quite low.", 
    "And because it dips quite low, look at the output.", 
    "The output has a bump here.", 
    "And it's quite possible for this outward bump to now go", 
    "into the forbidden region.", 
    "Or worse, if this swing here was higher, this could have", 
    "actually gone on to a 1.", 
    "So I would've gotten a false 1 pulse here.", 
    "So instead of having a nice 1 to 0 transition, I would've", 
    "gotten 1 to 0.", 
    "Oh, back to 1.", 
    "Oh, back to 0, and then back down to 0.", 
    "So this is nasty stuff, really, really nasty stuff."
