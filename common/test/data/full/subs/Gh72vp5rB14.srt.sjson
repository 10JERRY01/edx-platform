    "PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL: So before I go to the next topic,", 
    "I wanted to dwell on one very important point.", 
    "Now, you have seen many time constants in", 
    "this course so far.", 
    "When you did RC circuits, you saw one time constant RC.", 
    "Then when you did resistive inductive circuits, you saw a", 
    "second time constant L divided by R.", 
    "You recall the equations e raised to minus t over RC and", 
    "e raised to minus t divided by L over R. So you", 
    "saw two time constants.", 
    "These time constants related to how fast these RC and RL", 
    "circuits reacted to changes.", 
    "So in the RL circuit-- so this was for an RC circuit, and", 
    "this was for an RL circuit.", 
    "Then we looked at LC circuits.", 
    "So the other time constant you now saw for an", 
    "LC circuit was what?", 
    "I would hit the pause button here and think about what were", 
    "the time constant you saw with LC circuits.", 
    "Well, you saw omega 0, which was equal to 1 by", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "Remember, omega 0.", 
    "Omega 0 was the frequency with which the inductive capacitive", 
    "circuits oscillated.", 
    "Recall cosine omega 0 t and so on.", 
    "These circuits oscillated at frequency omega 0 where the", 
    "frequency omega 0 was determined by 1 by", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "So that is the physical interpretation of omega 0.", 
    "So, much like the resistor circuits decayed at RC, or the", 
    "resistive inductive circuits decayed at time constant L/R,", 
    "similarly in these LC circuits, their temporal", 
    "behavior, the frequency behavior, how fast they", 
    "oscillate is governed by 1 divided by square root of LC.", 
    "So that is the third kind of time", 
    "constant that you've seen--", 
    "one, two, and three.", 
    "The time constant for the L circuits had to do with the", 
    "frequency at which they oscillated in", 
    "a sinusoidal manner.", 
    "So with that quick little nugget, we are now ready to", 
    "take our next step and introduce a resistance into", 
    "our circuits and get to our LC circuits.", 
    "So as a very quick review, I have an LC circuit here.", 
    "And for this LC circuit, as a function of time, if my VI", 
    "took a step input, so if VI took a step input from 0 to", 
    "capital VI, then my capacitive and inductive circuits would", 
    "behave in a manner given by this, where we saw that I was", 
    "able to reach values of 2VI on the voltage, where VI was an", 
    "input step.", 
    "So my output voltage, the voltage across the capacitor,", 
    "took a jump to twice the input value, and this is what I saw.", 
    "So this was my response for the LC without any resistance.", 
    "And the frequency of oscillations here where omega", 
    "0 was governed by 1 over square root of LC.", 
    "So now let's introduce a resistance.", 
    "So supposing I go to this little circuit here, and I put", 
    "in a resistance R. How does it change things?", 
    "OK, there you go.", 
    "So that's my input step without the R.", 
    "Now, once I introduce the R, what happens to the world?", 
    "The moment you introduce R, I'm going to get damped", 
    "sinusoids with R, so those are going to look like this.", 
    "Rather than sitting there and oscillating from 0 to 2VI,", 
    "those are going to start oscillating, but they are", 
    "going to be damped.", 
    "They're going to look like that.", 
    "They're going to be sinusoidal in form, but they", 
    "are going to decay.", 
    "The sinusoidal oscillations are going to decay, and this", 
    "is with R, with the damping.", 
    "So now you recall the demo.", 
    "In the demo you recall what you saw, waveforms", 
    "that look like this.", 
    "In the next sequence, we're going to look at adding R, and", 
    "we will see that these circuits will indeed produce", 
    "the kind of damped oscillations that", 
    "we saw in our demo.", 
    "In the next sequence, you will see these damped oscillations.", 
    "And if you are impatient, you can go look up the section", 
    "13.2 in the textbook.", 
    "So just as a very quick summary again, we got pure", 
    "sinusoids with LC circuits where the frequency of", 
    "oscillation was governed by the second-order time constant", 
    "omega 0 equals 1 over square root of LC.", 
    "And then when I added an R, these", 
    "oscillations did not continue.", 
    "As you might expect, they get damped out.", 
    "And this is again reminiscent of our pendulum analogy where,", 
    "if there's some damping going on, the pendulum doesn't give", 
    "swinging infinitely with the same amplitude.", 
    "Its amplitude just swings kind of gradually and decays out", 
    "until the pendulum stops.", 
    "And this is similar to an LC circuit that is oscillating", 
    "and is damped because of the presence of a resistor.", 
    "And really what is going on is that--", 
    "because the resistor, as current flows through it, it", 
    "suffers i squared R losses.", 
    "And what that does is it causes some of the energy to", 
    "be dissipated in the capacitor, OK?", 
    "Dissipated in the resistor, I'm sorry.", 
    "Capacitors and inductors don't dissipate energy.", 
    "They store energy.", 
    "But if I put a resistor inside the circuit, then the resistor", 
    "sits there like a bandit dissipating energy until the", 
    "oscillations finally decay out.", 
    "We'll see more about this in the next sequence."
