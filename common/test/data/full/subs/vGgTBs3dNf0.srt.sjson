    "SPEAKER 1: I've changed colors again.", 
    "And next, what we do is we go ahead and dope this region", 
    "here, right beside the gate.", 
    "We dope it very heavily with n-type dopant.", 
    "Notice that the bulk here, the bulk region, was doped with", 
    "p-type material.", 
    "P-type had an excess of holes.", 
    "Now what I'm going to do is I dope right here and here, with", 
    "n-type material.", 
    "Let me mark that down.", 
    "N-type dopants have an access of electrons.", 
    "Not surprising.", 
    "N for negative, P for positive.", 
    "So n-type material, and that causes an excess of electrons.", 
    "And in fact, it's much more than n-type.", 
    "What I'm going to do is make it n-plus.", 
    "I'm going to dope it really heavily with", 
    "n-type material here.", 
    "And by doing so, I get just a huge quantity of electrons,", 
    "such that it becomes a really, really much better conductor", 
    "than the bulk, which was somewhat reasonably doped.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So what happens now?", 
    "So I have this metal plate.", 
    "And I have this region here.", 
    "And I have excess of holes in these two little well-like", 
    "regions right beside the gate, which is sitting on top of the", 
    "bulk region where they all are very thin layer of oxide.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So now take this structure.", 
    "And what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply a positive", 
    "voltage to the metal in relation to the bulk silicate.", 
    "I'm going to apply a positive potential.", 
    "I'm going to cause a positive potential difference to happen", 
    "between the metal and the bulk.", 
    "In other words, if I apply a positive voltage with respect", 
    "to the bulk at the middle, then what do I expect?", 
    "What I expect to see happen is the following.", 
    "It's like in this capacitor, if I apply a positive voltage", 
    "here, then what's going to happen in this capacitor?", 
    "In this capacitor, I would get positive charges here.", 
    "And I would get negative charges here.", 
    "Not surprisingly, if I apply a positive voltage here in this", 
    "thing that seemingly looks like a capacitor, I get a set", 
    "of positive charges here.", 
    "Now what happens in the region between just below the gate in", 
    "the silicon area?", 
    "Something very interesting happens.", 
    "What happens now is, because I've applied a positive", 
    "potential here, I am going to get electrons attracted from", 
    "this electron-rich region.", 
    "Think of it as this being a very rich territory under the", 
    "gate, and I'm going to get a whole bunch of migrant", 
    "electron workers that come flying in from the negative", 
    "charge-rich, electron-rich regions right by the gate.", 
    "And they are going to come here and equalize the positive", 
    "charges on the metal of the polysilicon plate.", 
    "So negative charges, electrons, from the n-rich", 
    "region will now migrate from that region", 
    "in this region here.", 
    "And they will form a channel.", 
    "And so suddenly something very interesting happens.", 
    "This looks exactly like a parallel plate capacitor,", 
    "which has positive charges here, negative charges here,", 
    "and there's an insulator in the middle.", 
    "And right there, I have a capacitor.", 
    "So in other words, from a structural standpoint, what I", 
    "end up getting now is my gate that looked like this.", 
    "My symbols-- a drain, source, and gate-- now has a capacitor", 
    "associated with it somehow.", 
    "So just to complete the physical structure here, as", 
    "you might have guessed by now, this is the drain.", 
    "And this here is the source.", 
    "So I've built a drain and I've built a source, and my", 
    "electrons have flowed from the electron-rich region here into", 
    "the channel region.", 
    "And because this is negative charges here, this is called", 
    "an n-channel.", 
    "So now you know why this kind of a MOSFET is called a", 
    "n-channel MOSFET.", 
    "So in terms of a symbol, notice that this is the gate,", 
    "this is this drain, and this is this source, and that", 
    "corresponds to the gate here, the drain here,", 
    "and the source here.", 
    "And in addition, what I've now gotten is", 
    "I've gotten a capacitor.", 
    "Now technically, from a structure standpoint, the", 
    "capacitor is associated with both the drain and the source.", 
    "For reasons that we won't go into details in 6.002x, we", 
    "commonly draw the capacitor between the", 
    "gate and the source.", 
    "And I'm going to call it Cgs.", 
    "It's a capacitor between the gate and the source.", 
    "We're really taking that capacitor and pretending that", 
    "it is acting between the gate and the source,", 
    "and we call it Cgs.", 
    "Technically, remember, there is a capacitance from the gate", 
    "to the drain as well, but unless we say explicitly in", 
    "6.002x, we simply model it as a gate-to-source capacitance.", 
    "So this much is enough, in terms of understanding for the", 
    "rest of the sequence.", 
    "But I just want to go ahead and tell you a little bit more", 
    "about how a MOSFET really, really works, just to complete", 
    "this little mystery for you.", 
    "So now I have this structure that I've shown you here.", 
    "I have an oxide, a metal, and I have this n-channel.", 
    "And the n-channel and the metal of polysilicon form a", 
    "parallel plate capacitor.", 
    "So now it is pretty simple.", 
    "If I apply a positive voltage at the drain, if I apply a", 
    "positive potential at the drain with respect to source--", 
    "so for example, the source is at ground potential--", 
    "and I apply, say, one volt or two volts or whatever at the", 
    "drain, what happens?", 
    "So now what happens is that, if I apply a political", 
    "potential there, then the electrons are", 
    "attracted to the drain.", 
    "And they come out of the source, they get attracted", 
    "towards the drain, and I now get an electron flow from the", 
    "source heading towards the drain.", 
    "And the current moves in the opposite direction to", 
    "electrons, and so I get a positive current flowing from", 
    "the drain to the source.", 
    "So now you can see why the source is called the source.", 
    "It is producing electrons.", 
    "And now you know why the drain is called the drain.", 
    "It is taking these electrons and sinking back.", 
    "The circuit is completed, of course.", 
    "If I have some circuit that connects the drain and source", 
    "to a variety of elements, then that closes the circuit for", 
    "the current to flow.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So that describes briefly how semiconductors work and how", 
    "build MOSFETs on top of semiconductors.", 
    "And I've also shown you that by applying a gate voltage, if", 
    "I apply a positive gate voltage here, I attract", 
    "electrons up into the channel.", 
    "The channel becomes conducting, and then if I", 
    "apply a drain to source potential, a positive voltage", 
    "at the drain, then current will flow from the drain to", 
    "the source, and electrons flow from the source to the drain.", 
    "You can also see why the MOSFET is symmetric about the", 
    "source and the drain, because clearly, at least to the level", 
    "that we are studying it in 6.002x, there is no dramatic", 
    "difference between the drain and the source.", 
    "I could fairly easily invert the source and the drain just", 
    "by applying a positive voltage, and it would still", 
    "work the same.", 
    "So interestingly enough, really, for the n-channel", 
    "MOSFET, the drain is technically taken to be the", 
    "well here with the higher potential voltage.", 
    "Now where does the threshold voltage come in?", 
    "So it turns out, if you do more advanced courses in", 
    "semiconductor physics and device physics, you will learn", 
    "as I apply a voltage to the gate here, electrons gradually", 
    "keep building up.", 
    "But in order to do that, it takes a fair amount of voltage", 
    "before there is a conducting channel form.", 
    "And that is called a threshold voltage.", 
    "A threshold voltage is a voltage by which there is a", 
    "reasonable conducting channel form, and it takes a bit of", 
    "voltage to overcome a set of natural forces that are",
