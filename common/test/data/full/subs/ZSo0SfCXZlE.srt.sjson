    "Let me see if I can slowly\ndrag this up so", 
    "that we can see it.", 
    "A little bit farther.", 
    "We can see that, in fact, as the\nfrequency increases, the", 
    "response of minus 12 dB\nwould be 1/4 of the", 
    "value, is what we expect.", 
    "But as the frequency increases,\nthe response of", 
    "that middle node drops off.", 
    "And in fact, at 1 kilohertz\nhere-- that&#39;s the", 
    "logarithm of 3--", 
    "we can see the response is\ndown about 25 dB from the", 
    "reference voltage value, which\nis up here at 0 dB.",
