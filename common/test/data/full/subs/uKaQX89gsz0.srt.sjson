    "SPEAKER 1: So let me go ahead and do the", 
    "calculation for you.", 
    "And before I show you the last piece of this video, you", 
    "should go and think for yourself.", 
    "What might the numbers that you obtained have", 
    "to do with the sun?", 
    "So for our little gate--", 
    "because of our gate, this is the formula for the power.", 
    "Because of a one gate, there's a static power given by VS", 
    "squared divided by 2 Rl and a dynamic power given", 
    "by CVs squared f.", 
    "So let's do a calculation.", 
    "So suppose I have a chip.", 
    "I have a chip like a microprocessor, for instance.", 
    "Let's say it has five million gates.", 
    "Let's say the chip clocks at three gigahertz which is a", 
    "typical blocking frequency in the circuits of the 2011- 2012", 
    "time frame.", 
    "Of course, the kind of circuits we've been building", 
    "with the Rl resistor.", 
    "But that's not used at all.", 
    "But we've been using it for pedagogical purposes to", 
    "understand the concepts.", 
    "But it's not unusual to see circuits in the 2012 time", 
    "frame with clock speeds of 2 to 3 gigahertz.", 
    "So let's pick that clock speed and see where that takes us.", 
    "So I have a chip with five million gates", 
    "clocking at 3 gigahertz.", 
    "Let me also assume that the capacitance C is 1 femtofarad.", 
    "And if we assume that Rl, the load resistor is 10 kiloohms", 
    "As I said earlier, the frequency is three gigahertz.", 
    "So it's 3 times 10 to the ninth.", 
    "And then we start off by assuming that Vs", 
    "is a nasty 5 volts.", 
    "It's 5 volts into the pedagogical", 
    "voltage, think of it.", 
    "The voltage we have been using for this class just to keep", 
    "things simple.", 
    "Let's see where that takes us.", 
    "So recall we have a static power, an average static", 
    "power, and we have a dynamic power right down here.", 
    "So what is the static power for a single gate?", 
    "It's Vs squared divided by 2 Rl.", 
    "So Vs is 5 volts, so Vs squared is 25.", 
    "And Rl is 10 kiloohms. So I have 2 times 10 to the fourth.", 
    "Let's say my goal is to compute the total power.", 
    "So to the static power, let me add the dynamic power.", 
    "Dynamic power is CVs squared f.", 
    "So C is 1 femtofarad.", 
    "So that is 10 raised to minus 15.", 
    "A nice little number.", 
    "Remember, for power, smaller is better.", 
    "So Vs squared.", 
    "So times Vs squared.", 
    "Oops, let me just put the real numbers down.", 
    "Vs is five so Vs squared is 25.", 
    "The clock frequency is 3 gigahertz so that that's 3", 
    "times 10 to the ninth So that's the power", 
    "for a single gate.", 
    "Now notice I have 5 million gates.", 
    "So let me multiply the total power for a", 
    "single gate by 5 million.", 
    "So that is the total power that my chip will burn if I", 
    "have 5 million of these inverts and if I drive each of", 
    "them with a square of the input.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do the calculation.", 
    "5 times 10 to the sixth.", 
    "So here 25 divided by 2 is 12.5.", 
    "And 12.5 divided by 10 to the fourth is 1.25 milliwatts.", 
    "You may say, come on.", 
    "1.25 milliwatts is a tiny number.", 
    "But notice when I multiply 1.25 milliwatts with a", 
    "gigantic number of gates like 5 million.", 
    "And in today's circuits you might see 100 million gates", 
    "where today is 2012.", 
    "Let me do the same calculation for the dynamic power.", 
    "For the dynamic power, let me calculate this.", 
    "10 to the minus 15, 10 to the 9, gives me 10 to the minus 6.", 
    "So it's 75 times 10 to the minus 6.", 
    "That is 75 microwatts.", 
    "That's a pretty nice and low number.", 
    "Well, it's easy if you don't multiply that out by very,", 
    "very big numbers of gates.", 
    "OK, so now if I complete my calculation, the static power", 
    "for the entire chip if I have 10 to the 6 multiplied by 1.25", 
    "milliwatts.", 
    "OK, so this is my P static.", 
    "This is a whopping 6.25 kilowatts.", 
    "And then the 75 microwatts times 5 times 10 to the sixth", 
    "comes out to be 375 watts.", 
    "Just imagine this number here.", 
    "6.25 kilowatts.", 
    "An electric iron, the thing you use to iron your clothes.", 
    "That is on the order of 1.5 kilowatts.", 
    "So what this is saying is that just the static power being", 
    "burned by my chip with the mere 5 million gates is as", 
    "much as on the order of four electric irons.", 
    "6.25 kilowatts.", 
    "What else?", 
    "Also, notice that this number gets added to the 375 watts,", 
    "which is actually not too bad", 
    "compared to the 6.25 kilowatts.", 
    "But that's still pretty bad.", 
    "So 6.25 kilowatts is a clear, unmitigated disaster.", 
    "This is a total disaster.", 
    "The 375 watts is pretty bad.", 
    "This is bad.", 
    "But it's not a total disaster.", 
    "So in order to go from 6.25 kilowatts, to do something", 
    "better, I need some fundamental change to what", 
    "I've been doing.", 
    "We need to fundamentally redesign our gate.", 
    "So in one of the sequences next week, I want to show you", 
    "a trick that is used to make that power go away to", 
    "virtually zero.", 
    "So let me just give you a hint that we'll talk about that in", 
    "the next sequence when we'll show you the simple little", 
    "trick that makes that power become virtually zero.", 
    "But I won't tell it to you now.", 
    "I'll give you a little bit of a surprise", 
    "and keep you in suspense.", 
    "But let's look at the dynamic power, the 375 watts.", 
    "That's my P average dynamic or the active power.", 
    "Let me switch to green because we need to build some green", 
    "chips so that we don't see this huge power.", 
    "So what can we do?", 
    "The reason this 375 is pretty high is that, first of all,", 
    "the power is proportional to Vs", 
    "squared, my voltage squared.", 
    "That's not good.", 
    "So I can fix that.", 
    "I'm using 5 volts.", 
    "I can fix that by going from 5 volts, for example, to one", 
    "volt or lower.", 
    "So if I use both my circuits with 1 volt and, in fact, in", 
    "today's chips, the microprocessors in your laptop", 
    "or the chips in your cell phone, the voltages used to", 
    "drive those gates and so on are nowhere close to 5 volts.", 
    "The voltage in the late 70s was 5 volts.", 
    "But the voltages kept decreasing over time.", 
    "And in today's chips, the voltages actually used are on", 
    "the order of 0.7, 0.8 volt, sometimes 1 volt.", 
    "So at one volt or lower is where voltages typically are.", 
    "Notice that when I go from 5 volts to 1 volt, I can cut my", 
    "power down by a factor of 25.", 
    "It's Vs squared.", 
    "5 squared is 25.", 
    "1 squared is one.", 
    "So I can cut by power down by a factor of 25.", 
    "The second thing is that my power relates to", 
    "my frequency, f.", 
    "So you can say, let's reduce my frequency drastically.", 
    "But the problem of reducing frequency is if I reduce the", 
    "speed at which I operate my chip, if I change the clock", 
    "frequency, the speed at which I apply inputs to my circuit,", 
    "then my computational speed goes down as well.", 
    "But be that as it may, if I lower the frequency, my power", 
    "consumed also goes down in proportion.", 
    "In particular, if I go from Vs to be 5 volts to 1 volt, my", 
    "375 watts comes down to 375 divided by 25.", 
    "But I divide 375 by 25, which is going from", 
    "5 volts to 1 volt.", 
    "My power comes down to about 15 watts.", 
    "That's pretty good.", 
    "We could reduce frequency and bring the", 
    "power down some more.", 
    "But really we need to go down even more than 15 watts.", 
    "So we look at some ideas.", 
    "And you can do that, for example, by lowering the", 
    "voltage some more.", 
    "If you go down from 1 volt to 0.7 volts, we can get another", 
    "factor of 2 in power decrease.", 
    "I can use other techniques.", 
    "I can lower the frequency somehow and use techniques", 
    "like using more gates.", 
    "I can use more gates.", 
    "Of course, if I have more gates, I'm going to consume", 
    "more power.", 
    "But it turns out that there are tricks you can do.", 
    "In modern chips, there are tricks that you can do in", 
    "order to cut down the power some more.", 
    "So together, you can reduce the power substantially.", 
    "We look at some of these ideas in a future sequence.", 
    "For now let me get down to answering the question that I", 
    "posed for you at the early part of the sequence.", 
    "The question was, what does our previous style of building", 
    "logic gates have to do with the sun?", 
    "So here was my previous title of building logic gates.", 
    "So what does this have to do with the sun?", 
    "Well, it turns out that if I have a chip that's 1", 
    "centimeter squared in size--", 
    "Chips are typically about 10 millimeters on a side, so one", 
    "square centimeter.", 
    "The chips are square, flat little pieces of silicon.", 
    "And then if I take a one centimeter squared area at", 
    "roughly the surface of the sun.", 
    "So I take a one centimeter piece of silicon.", 
    "And I take a one square centimeter area of the surface", 
    "of the sun.", 
    "What is interesting is, by our calculation--", 
    "Let me switch to red, because this is like big power.", 
    "Recall for a chip the standby power was 6.25 watts.", 
    "So this one centimeter chip was--", 
    "I'm sorry, 6.25 kilowatts.", 
    "We can't miss the whole factor of a thousand there.", 
    "6.25 kilowatts.", 
    "And surprisingly enough, at the surface of the sun, the", 
    "amount of power being generated, the amount of power", 
    "being supplied is very close at 6.35 kilowatts.", 
    "If you look at these two numbers, this means that if I", 
    "build chips today according to the style shown here with the", 
    "Rl load resistance, with that load resistance up there, some", 
    "other trick.", 
    "Then my tips will be dissipating as much power,", 
    "burning as much power, as the power being supplied out off", 
    "one square centimeter of the same area", 
    "of the sun's surface.", 
    "Believe it or not."
