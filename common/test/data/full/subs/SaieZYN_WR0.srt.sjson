    "SPEAKER 1: Now that we have come\ninto this EECS playground", 
    "and made sure amongst ourselves\nthat we are going to", 
    "abide by the lumped matter\ndiscipline, what does it", 
    "really buy us?", 
    "What do we really gain\nby doing so?", 
    "Before I begin, let me remind\nyou that the material that we", 
    "will cover in this segment is in\nchapters 2.1 through 2.2.2", 
    "of the textbook.", 
    "So I claim that by abiding by\nthe discipline, this will", 
    "allow us to replace the\ndifferential equations from", 
    "Maxwell with really, really\nsimple algebra using the", 
    "lumped circuit abstraction.", 
    "In other words, we&#39;re going\nto be able to replace the", 
    "squiggly dels and phis and so on\nwith something as simple as", 
    "2 times a plus 3 times\nb equals 0, and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "Differential equations\nwith simple algebra.", 
    "Believe me.", 
    "I&#39;m going to show you that.", 
    "So to do an example, let me\npull up a circuit here,", 
    "containing a voltage source\nsupplying the voltage V. And", 
    "in the circuit, I have\nfive resistors.", 
    "This is a bridge circuit,\nresistors R1 through R5.", 
    "And in the circuit, notice that\nI have some nodes where", 
    "many of these elements\ncome together.", 
    "So in this circuit, for\ninstance, I have the element", 
    "R1, element R4, and the element\nvoltage source come", 
    "together at a node.", 
    "So when I build these ideal\ncircuits from elements and", 
    "ideal wires, where\nthe wires come", 
    "together is called a node.", 
    "This is node A. This\nthing here with the", 
    "resistor R4, for instance--", 
    "that is called a branch.", 
    "And a connection all a set of\nelements that form a full", 
    "circuit is called a loop.", 
    "So for example, this is\na loop in the circuit.", 
    "So we&#39;ve seen a node.", 
    "So a is a node for example.", 
    "This is a loop.", 
    "And one of these elements\nis a branch.", 
    "So let me ask the\nfirst question.", 
    "Given the lumped matter\ndiscipline, what can we say", 
    "about voltages in a loop\nunder the LMD?", 
    "So here&#39;s my circuit again.", 
    "And I&#39;m asking the\nfirst question.", 
    "What can I say about voltages in\nthis loop under the lumped", 
    "matter discipline?", 
    "Do I see some extraordinary\nsimplifications or not?", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to show you\nis-- let me start with some", 
    "Maxwell&#39;s equations with\nsquigglies and dels and so on,", 
    "and see how we can\nsimplify them.", 
    "So by Maxwell, we know for the\nloop that integral E.dl is", 
    "equal to minus del\nphi B by del t.", 
    "OK, so we know that from one\nof Maxwell&#39;s equations, the", 
    "integral form.", 
    "E.dl integral equals minus\ndel phi B by del t.", 
    "But remember, we have\nchosen this to be 0.", 
    "This is not true in general.", 
    "Remember, according to the\nlumped matter discipline in", 
    "the EECS playground, we have\nchosen that to be 0 by working", 
    "only with elements for\nwhich that is 0.", 
    "So what does that mean?", 
    "So for this loop here, integral\nE.dl is equal to 0.", 
    "OK, so what is the\nintegral of E.dl?", 
    "So integral of E.dl is--", 
    "there&#39;s a piece here.", 
    "If I go and break up my integral\naround the circle to", 
    "multiple components, my first\npart here is the integral from", 
    "c to a, E.dl--", 
    "from the node c to the node a--\nplus the integral from the", 
    "node a to node b-- so\nE.dl from a to b--", 
    "plus the integral from\nb to c, E.dl.", 
    "So E.dl for the whole loop is\ngiven by the sum of the three", 
    "subintegrals from c to a,\na to be, and b to c.", 
    "That gives me the entire loop.", 
    "So notice, by definition, the\nintegral from c to a, E.dl, is", 
    "simply Vca, and the integral\nE.dl, a to be, is by", 
    "definition Vab, which\nis the voltage Vab.", 
    "And similarly, Vbc, and\nso that is equal to 0.", 
    "In other words, from the\ndefinition of voltage, which", 
    "comes from integral E.dl over\nany path from c to a, I get", 
    "Vca, the voltage difference\nfrom c to a, and so on.", 
    "And so the sum of the\nthree voltages is 0.", 
    "So I&#39;ve just show you something\npretty spectacular.", 
    "What I&#39;ve shown you is that when\nyou make the assumption,", 
    "minus del phi B del t equals\n0, according to the lumped", 
    "matter discipline, then that\ndirectly results in my finding", 
    "out that the sum of the voltages\nin a loop built out", 
    "of such elements is 0.", 
    "So in a lumped circuit\nabstraction, the sum of", 
    "voltages in a loop is 0.", 
    "And this is known as Kirchhoff&#39;s\nVoltage Law, KVL.", 
    "Kirchhoff&#39;s Voltage Law, or KVL,\nsimply says that the sum", 
    "of the voltages in\na loop is 0.", 
    "Now I just caution you,\nremember, this is not true", 
    "everywhere.", 
    "If you exit our EECS playground,\nthen bad things", 
    "might happen.", 
    "This is not true.", 
    "This is only true in our EECS\nplayground where we have", 
    "agreed to follow the lumped\nmatter discipline.", 
    "Let&#39;s go to the next step, and\nwhat can we say about currents", 
    "in the same lumped circuit?", 
    "So what I&#39;d like to do is--\nlet me look at the node", 
    "labeled a, and let&#39;s\ntalk about the", 
    "currents in that node.", 
    "So let me draw the node a here,\nand so I have three", 
    "currents coming into it.", 
    "I have a current I da\ncoming into it from", 
    "the right-hand side.", 
    "So I have I da coming in here.", 
    "I have a current I ca coming\nin from the left-hand side.", 
    "And then I have a third current\nI ba coming in from", 
    "the bottom, through\nresistor R1.", 
    "OK, so here are my three\ncurrents coming", 
    "into that node a.", 
    "So what can we say about\nthese three currents--", 
    "I ca, I da, and I ba--", 
    "that come to the point a?", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m\ngoing to build a closed", 
    "surface around a.", 
    "Around this point a, I&#39;m going\nto build this closed surface", 
    "and see what I can find out.", 
    "OK, so here is my closed surface\naround point a, and", 
    "let me see what I can argue\nabout the three currents under", 
    "the lumped matter discipline.", 
    "So from another one of Maxwell&#39;s\nequations, I know", 
    "that the following is true.", 
    "I know J is the current density\ninto the surface, is", 
    "equal to minus del q by del t.", 
    "That&#39;s another one of my\nMaxwell&#39;s equations, where the", 
    "surface integral of the current\ngoing into a surface,", 
    "S, integrated over the\nsurface, equals minus", 
    "del q by del t.", 
    "But remember, what I&#39;ve done\nis I&#39;ve taken this", 
    "to be 0 under LMD.", 
    "For the moment I&#39;ve taken\nthat to be 0.", 
    "What do I get?", 
    "So if I look at this whole\nsurface, really, I have three", 
    "currents going into it.", 
    "And so I immediately find\nout that I ca plus I da", 
    "plus I ba equals 0.", 
    "My surface integral of the\ncurrent density of the surface", 
    "is simply the sum of\nthe three currents.", 
    "So this is another spectacular\nresult which says that the sum", 
    "of my three currents into a\nclosed surface is 0 under the", 
    "condition that I do not have\nany time varying", 
    "increasing or decreasing\ncharge at the point a.", 
    "This is the expression\nof Kirchhoff&#39;s", 
    "Current Law, or KCL.", 
    "The law states that the sum of\nthe currents into a node in a", 
    "circuit is 0.", 
    "Or differently, this is simply\na statement of the", 
    "conservation of charge.", 
    "So finally, to summarize my KVL\nand KCL, KVL simply states", 
    "that the sum of the voltages\nfor any loop is 0.", 
    "So given any loop, the sum of\nthe voltages is 0, because of", 
    "any loop, I can sum the voltages\naround that loop, and", 
    "that would be 0.", 
    "And KCL says that if I pick any\nnode in a circuit, then", 
    "the currents coming into that\nnode are going to be 0.", 
    "So for all currents that come\ninto a node, I can sum them", 
    "all up and they will\nalso be 0.", 
    "OK, so that&#39;s KVL and KCL.",
