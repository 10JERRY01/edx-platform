    "SPEAKER 1: In this next\nsequence, we will cover", 
    "non-linear circuits.", 
    "The reading is Chapter 4.1\nthrough 4.3 in the textbook.", 
    "Non-linear circuits\ncontain one or", 
    "more non-linear elements.", 
    "And these elements are different\nfrom the linear", 
    "elements that you&#39;ve\nseen so far.", 
    "A non-linear element is one\nwhose vi relation is", 
    "non-linear.", 
    "So for example, if I have an\nelement whose current i", 
    "relates to the voltage across\nits terminals as some constant", 
    "times v squared would be\na non-linear element.", 
    "So in this sequence, we will\ncover such elements and", 
    "circuits built using\nthose elements.", 
    "Let&#39;s start with a\nreview, as usual.", 
    "We started this course by\ndiscretizing matter and", 
    "developing the lump circuit\nabstraction.", 
    "Our first step was to create a\ntool chest containing several", 
    "analysis techniques.", 
    "And we&#39;ve looked at\nfive techniques.", 
    "Method one was what we call\nthe KVL/KCL Method.", 
    "And in this method, you combine\nKVL/KCL relationships", 
    "and the iv relation for all the\nelements in the circuit,", 
    "put them into a but hopper and\nended up having to solve a set", 
    "of system equations that\neventually gave rise to all", 
    "the voltages and currents\nfor the circuit.", 
    "Our second method involved\ncomposition rules where you", 
    "use simple additions,\nsubtractions kinds of analyses", 
    "to compose resistances\nand sources together.", 
    "A third method, which I said was\nthe real workhorse of our", 
    "business, was the node method.", 
    "And by and large, we\napplied this method", 
    "to most of our circuits.", 
    "We then covered methods\nfour and five.", 
    "Method four was the\nsuperposition method, and", 
    "method five were the Thevenin\nand Norton dual methods.", 
    "Now, recall, if you look at the\nfirst three methods, these", 
    "methods apply to any circuit.", 
    "However, if you look at the\nlast two methods-- the", 
    "superposition and Thevenin\nmethods--", 
    "these apply to only\nlinear circuits.", 
    "So when in doubt, go ahead\nand use a node method.", 
    "But the superposition\nand Thevenin methods", 
    "are extremely powerful.", 
    "And what is interesting about\nthese methods is that you can", 
    "apply these methods to do linear\nsub-circuits as well.", 
    "So if you have a big circuit,\nand then the whole big circuit", 
    "may contain linear and\nnon-linear elements, you can", 
    "carve out, if you have a\nbig circuit like this--", 
    "and it could be the arbitrary\ncircuit--", 
    "but if we can carve out some\npart of the circuit that is", 
    "linear, then you can apply\nthese methods to that", 
    "sub-circuit as well.", 
    "We will use this trick in some\nof what we do today.", 
    "Continuing with our review.", 
    "After we built the lump\ncircuit abstraction by", 
    "discretizing matter, we\ncontinued with this method of", 
    "discretization, and we\ndiscretized value.", 
    "And by discretizing value, we\ncame up with the digital", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "So in this abstraction, we used\nones and zeroes of the", 
    "values in the circuit and just\nlooked at highs and lows.", 
    "We didn&#39;t care about\nintermediate values.", 
    "And this gave us the key\nproperty of noise immunity,", 
    "which really enabled us to build\nvery large circuits and", 
    "systems that worked consistently\nin many noisy", 
    "environments.", 
    "One of the interesting things\nto note with the digital", 
    "domain is that it\nis very tightly", 
    "coupled to analog design.", 
    "The two are really, really\nvery close to each other.", 
    "And the foundations of\nboth are the same.", 
    "And one thing to notice was that\nwith digital circuits as", 
    "well, some circuits\nfor a given switch", 
    "setting were all linear.", 
    "So in other words, if I took a\ncircuit and I established some", 
    "switch values, and then for\nthose fixed switch values, I", 
    "ended up with circuits that were\nlinear for the kinds of", 
    "switches and kinds of elements\nthat we had talked about.", 
    "And once you have that, you\ncould apply any one of the", 
    "five methods that we discussed\nso far to those circuits.", 
    "So just as a quick example,\nsupposing I had this circuit.", 
    "And recall, this circuit is a\nNOR gate, A, B, and C. And", 
    "this is a NOR gate because the\noutput C goes to 0 if either A", 
    "or B are a 1.", 
    "If A is a 1 or B is a 1, the\noutput is going to go to 0.", 
    "And that is reflected\nof a NOR property.", 
    "So that is a NOR gate.", 
    "Now, if you look at this gate\nand apply the switch resistor", 
    "MOSFET model to build an\nequivalent circuit for this", 
    "gate, then what do you see?", 
    "So supposing I use my\nswitch settings--", 
    "A equals 1 and B equals 1.", 
    "Both are high.", 
    "Then you will get the circuits\nseen on the right here.", 
    "This circuit is a sub-circuit\nthat you get.", 
    "And notice, the sub-circuit\ncontains a voltage source and", 
    "contains three resistors, So\nthis circuit is linear.", 
    "Then I can choose a different\nset of switch settings--", 
    "A equals 1 and B equals 0.", 
    "So for that, here, the B input\nMOSFET is turned off while all", 
    "the others are on the resistor\naudibles, of course, there.", 
    "And the MOSFET connected\nto A is also on.", 
    "So notice here that this\nsub-circuit is also linear.", 
    "So the beauty of this is that in\nthe digital domain, for the", 
    "kinds of circuits that we built\nand the elements we&#39;ve", 
    "used, for any given switch\nsetting, the sub-circuits that", 
    "I ended up with were also\nlinear, so I could apply all", 
    "my linear analysis methods.",
