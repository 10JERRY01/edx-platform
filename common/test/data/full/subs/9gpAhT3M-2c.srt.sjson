    "SPEAKER 1: So note that I am stuck rather at step two of my", 
    "differential equation solution.", 
    "And I was trying to solve rc dvp dt plus vp equals vi,", 
    "where vi was vi equal cosine omega t.", 
    "And I ran into all kinds of trouble.", 
    "I started out by mounting a frontal attack on this", 
    "mountain of a problem.", 
    "And that did not lead me anywhere.", 
    "So that approach was really, really hard.", 
    "In terms of an effort scale, that was way too hard.", 
    "So what I'm going to do now, as our usual practice, we", 
    "start guessing and trying other solutions.", 
    "So let me strike out in a completely different approach.", 
    "And I want to call that the sneaky approach.", 
    "I'm going to try a different approach and see if that gives", 
    "me a better way to get at the solution.", 
    "And just to clearly indicate that I'm taking a different", 
    "path and trying something sneaky here, let me try and", 
    "solve a slightly different problem.", 
    "So let me find the particular solution to another input and", 
    "see if I can find a path to a solution that", 
    "is easier from that.", 
    "All right, so I'm going to find the particular solution", 
    "to another input.", 
    "And let me write down the solution as vps so dvps.", 
    "And in this case it's ps.", 
    "It's not just p.", 
    "It's ps where s stands for the solution to a different input,", 
    "to a sneaky input, so vps.", 
    "And here I am going to try to solve this for a different", 
    "input, and vis, where the input that I'm going to pick", 
    "just for fun I'm going to call it s, s for sneaky.", 
    "All right?", 
    "OK, for fun I'm going to call it vis, s for sneaky.", 
    "And the input I'm going to choose, I'm guessing this", 
    "might help me, the input I'm going to choose is the same", 
    "amplitude, the real amplitude vi, and instead of making it", 
    "cosine omega t, I'm going to pick an exponential, e raised", 
    "to st.", 
    "I have a theory here.", 
    "My theory is that exponentials work really nicely as", 
    "solutions to differential equations.", 
    "And the reason is that, when I differentiate an exponential,", 
    "I get the exponential again.", 
    "So if I differentiate e raised to st, I get se raised to st.", 
    "So e raised to st shows up in each of these terms, which", 
    "makes it a really nice solution.", 
    "So I know that I can find a solution easily.", 
    "But I don't quite know how that will lead me to my", 
    "eventual vp, the particular solution, but", 
    "bear with me for now.", 
    "So I will try the sneaky input, vie raised to st, and", 
    "see if that will give me a solution much more easily.", 
    "Then we'll see if that gives us a sneaky path sort of an", 
    "end round to get to the solution.", 
    "So for that sneaky input vie raised to st let's go back and", 
    "do our usual thing.", 
    "We'll try a solution of vps given by vpe raised to st. So", 
    "vie raised to st was my sneaky input.", 
    "And we'll try to find the solution for that input and", 
    "writing vps as the particular solution to that input.", 
    "Because I want to pick vpe raised to st as my trial input", 
    "and see if that works.", 
    "So before I do the answer, why don't you go", 
    "ahead and try it out?", 
    "We give you an exercise.", 
    "For your next exercise, we'll have you work it and see if", 
    "you can come up with the solution of vps that will work", 
    "for a different kind of input."
