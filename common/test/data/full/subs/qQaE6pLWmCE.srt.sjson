    "SPEAKER 1: Now that I have my particular and homogeneous", 
    "solutions, I am ready to create the total solution.", 
    "So my total solution v of t is the sum of the particular", 
    "solution and the homogeneous solution.", 
    "So, as you recall, my particular solution was VI,", 
    "and my homogeneous solution was A1 e raised to minus alpha", 
    "plus square root of alpha squared minus omega naught", 
    "squared times t, so this times t, plus A2 e raised to minus", 
    "alpha minus alpha squared minus omega naught", 
    "squared times t.", 
    "Recall here that omega naught was square root of one by LC,", 
    "and recall that alpha was R by 2L for the series RLC circuit.", 
    "And of course, this solution is true for t greater than or", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "Notice that I've chosen a step as my input, and initial", 
    "conditions at time t equal to 0.", 
    "So here, I know the alphas and omega naughts,", 
    "and VI is my input.", 
    "So really, these are the two unknowns that", 
    "I do not know about.", 
    "So the next step, I can go ahead and find the unknowns,", 
    "A1 and A2, from initial conditions.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So let's go ahead and wrap this up.", 
    "We're almost there, mathematically at least, and", 
    "we need to find A1 and A2.", 
    "So let's go ahead and finish it up.", 
    "So we were given two initial conditions for", 
    "the two state variables.", 
    "v of 0 at time t equal to 0 was given as 0.", 
    "And we were given i at time t equals 0 was also 0.", 
    "This was a zero state response that we were looking for.", 
    "So at time t equal to 0, let's go write it down.", 
    "So we are given, from this equation here, so at time t", 
    "equal to 0 we are given that v of t is 0.", 
    "v of t at time t equals 0 is 0.", 
    "So that's 0.", 
    "All right?", 
    "So then I write VI.", 
    "And A1 e raised to something t is 1, so that becomes A1.", 
    "And similarly here, e raised to something t is 1 again, so", 
    "this is A2.", 
    "That's one equation.", 
    "All right?", 
    "Let's get the next equation.", 
    "Now, this equation gives us the initial condition that the", 
    "next initial condition is on the current.", 
    "And so we will use our usual trick.", 
    "OK?", 
    "We can get the current from the voltage using the", 
    "following equation. i of t is C dv dt.", 
    "All right?", 
    "So if I know the initial condition of i of t, then I", 
    "can apply the same initial condition on C dv dt.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So let me write down C dv dt.", 
    "So that is equal to C times something.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So if I take the dv dt of this expression here, the first", 
    "term, the VI term goes to 0.", 
    "For the second term, let me differentiate that with", 
    "respect to t.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "Boy, that is a little bit of a mess.", 
    "But, oh, let's barge ahead.", 
    "So I get A1 here, and then the term that multiplies t comes", 
    "down, so I get minus alpha plus square root of alpha", 
    "squared minus omega squared, and then e raised to minus", 
    "alpha plus square root of alpha squared minus", 
    "omega squared t.", 
    "Let me just draw a little line here to separate those two.", 
    "OK.", 
    "That's my first term.", 
    "For my second term, let me go ahead and that's", 
    "C A2 in this case.", 
    "I bring down the factor multiplying t and that's minus", 
    "alpha minus--", 
    "I write this a little tighter so I get", 
    "more space for myself--", 
    "alpha squared minus omega squared e raised to-- what do", 
    "I have here--", 
    "minus alpha minus alpha squared minus omega", 
    "naught squared t.", 
    "That wasn't too bad.", 
    "Just watch out here.", 
    "I may have made--", 
    "let me just double check very quickly.", 
    "I don't think I made any math errors, but", 
    "watch out for that.", 
    "There's a bunch of grubby math going on here.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So now, at time t equal to 0, so here, at time t equal to 0,", 
    "so at time t equals 0, I'm given that i of 0 is 0.", 
    "And so therefore I get 0 is equal to all of this stuff at", 
    "t equals 0.", 
    "What do I get?", 
    "OK.", 
    "e raised to something t goes to 1.", 
    "So I get C A1 times minus alpha plus square root of", 
    "alpha squared minus omega naught squared times 1 plus C", 
    "A2 times minus alpha minus alpha squared minus omega", 
    "naught squared.", 
    "And that's it.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So I have two equations now.", 
    "So I have one equation in A1 and A2, and I have a second", 
    "equation in A1 and A2.", 
    "So I can solve these two equations, and obtain the two", 
    "constants A1 and A2.", 
    "And so, therefore, I can solve for these", 
    "unknowns and I am done.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So the reason I'm being careful here, I'm saying I'm", 
    "done from a mathematical standpoint.", 
    "OK?", 
    "You can solve for A1 and A2 from these two equations, get", 
    "the constants, and plug the final values into the total", 
    "solution here, and I am done.", 
    "So that's it for the", 
    "mathematical part of the solution.", 
    "Now, I still haven't been able to give us a", 
    "whole lot of insight.", 
    "This solution here looks like a mess.", 
    "I cannot quite see where the decaying sinusoid is.", 
    "What should a decaying sinusoid look like?", 
    "Well, a decaying sinusoid should look something like", 
    "this, right?", 
    "It should be something like e to the minus something or", 
    "other times t, times some cosine omega t", 
    "something or the other.", 
    "OK?", 
    "I need something like this.", 
    "That says I have a sinusoid whose amplitude is controlled", 
    "by a decaying exponential.", 
    "I need something like that to get the decaying sinusoid.", 
    "I don't quite see that right now.", 
    "Right?", 
    "So what I'm going to do next is take a look at this", 
    "solution here and to try to tease it apart a little bit,", 
    "so that we can get a little bit more insight.", 
    "All right?", 
    "Let's move on to that."
