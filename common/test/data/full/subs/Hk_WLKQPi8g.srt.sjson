    "GERRY SUSSMAN: We've been studying the behavior of", 
    "systems with one or two energy storage elements, as inductors", 
    "and capacitors, to various stimuli, like for example, a", 
    "constant drive or a sinusoidal drive or", 
    "perhaps an impulse drive.", 
    "Those first and second-order systems are pretty", 
    "complicated.", 
    "But what normally happens is the way we solve them is we", 
    "make a differential equation.", 
    "And then we solve for a particular solution, which is", 
    "the solution to the system based on the drive.", 
    "The problem is that that solution does not necessarily", 
    "match the initial conditions.", 
    "So we have to solve the adjacent homogeneous equation", 
    "to make an additive adjustment to the particular solution", 
    "which matches the initial conditions.", 
    "And we get a transient from the", 
    "homogeneous part of the solution.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: So I'll point out how we say normally--", 
    "this is not something that I've commonly done in many", 
    "years of engineering and working with linear systems.", 
    "So moving forward, what we'll show is how to go from these", 
    "fairly complex techniques to a simplification set based on", 
    "those techniques but that are a lot easier to work with.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: Mostly one of the things we can do is find", 
    "that for most of the time, the particular integral is what we", 
    "care about.", 
    "That is, if we're talking about long-term behavior of", 
    "the system, we're not worried about the transient response.", 
    "Then indeed, what we care about is that we might have", 
    "something like some signal that goes on", 
    "for a very long time.", 
    "And then we're going to try to find the response to that.", 
    "Now, what was discovered by Fourier around 1800, is that", 
    "if I have some complicated signal like this, it can be", 
    "made out of the sum of sinusoids.", 
    "Which I can't draw very well.", 
    "But different sizes of different frequencies and", 
    "different amplitudes and different phases can be added", 
    "up to make up any--", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: Physically reasonable signal.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: Exactly.", 
    "So in fact, since these are linear systems, we can add up", 
    "the solutions to the various sinusoids to get a solution", 
    "for the entire system.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: So that's where superposition comes in.", 
    "So superposition is really kicking in in overdrive right", 
    "now, because we find two things.", 
    "One, we can solve differential equations very easily for", 
    "sinusoids, cosines, as well as exponentials.", 
    "And two, any signal that we may encounter in real life can", 
    "be decomposed into these.", 
    "So if we see the response of sinusoids and cosines--", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: We know everything.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: We essentially know everything.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: So in fact, the trick is--", 
    "you've probably already seen it somewhere along the line--", 
    "we can start with things like a capacitor.", 
    "We can replace the capacitor which is, I suppose,", 
    "i equals C dv dt.", 
    "And this equals i.", 
    "We can replace that with, in fact--", 
    "boy, that's pretty awful.", 
    "Replace that with the resistor, which says that the", 
    "ratio of the complex amplitudes of voltage to", 
    "current is equal to 1/Cs, where s is a complex number", 
    "which is j times the radian frequency.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: So what Gerry is doing here is he's taking this", 
    "complex time domain behavior and replacing it with a simple", 
    "frequency domain behavior.", 
    "So here, omega represents the frequency.", 
    "And we're moving into the frequency domain.", 
    "We're saying this is how a capacitor responds to one", 
    "sinusoid at a particular frequency, omega.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: So it's got equivalent resistance in the", 
    "frequency domain.", 
    "And an inductor, similarly, has a similar sort of thing.", 
    "Whereas we would normally have v equals L di dt, we can have", 
    "a resistor, which has the resistance V/I,", 
    "which is equal to Ls.", 
    "And therefore, we've changed the problem of a calculus", 
    "problem into an algebra problem, which is generally", 
    "easier to deal with.", 
    "So it turns out, once we've done this, then we take", 
    "complex systems consisting of inductors, capacitors, and", 
    "resistors, turn them into simpler systems, which contain", 
    "only resistors.", 
    "And then we can solve those with resistor network methods.", 
    "And then we can use the information we learned from", 
    "solving that system to help us understand what's going on in", 
    "the original time domain system.", 
    "So that's one thing that happens.", 
    "But the other thing is we end up saying, oh, yes, omega is a", 
    "radian frequency.", 
    "Omega equals 2 pi times the circular frequency.", 
    "And then the radio frequency, let's say 100 cycles per", 
    "second or something--", 
    "hertz.", 
    "And so in those cases, we sometimes draw graphs that say", 
    "how something behaves.", 
    "So this is the frequency and maybe this is the amplitude of", 
    "some signal.", 
    "And we might say, oh, we see something that does", 
    "something like this.", 
    "So we have some sort of graph in the frequency domain--", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: Can you label that axis?", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: Oh, yes, this might be the magnitude of some", 
    "voltage output over some voltage input, for some", 
    "complicated piece of machinery.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: And one thing I'll point out--", 
    "this will come up, I think, two lectures from now rather", 
    "than one lecture--", 
    "is that in almost all cases, these are log-log plots.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: But not what I just drew.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: Not what you just drew.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: What I drew was not a log-log plot.", 
    "But yes, indeed, it should be.", 
    "It should have been a log-log plot.", 
    "And even for simple things, like if I have", 
    "something like this--", 
    "well, this is sort of a low-pass filter.", 
    "And that is because the capacitor has its maximum", 
    "resistance, if you want to think of it that way.", 
    "You've got the frequency being very low.", 
    "And it has a 0 resistance, if you want to think of it that", 
    "way, when the frequency is very high, that", 
    "is, j omega is infinite.", 
    "Then we end up with things that look like basically a", 
    "low-pass filter in the frequency domain.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: So here, it's a log-log plot.", 
    "A linear plot would be flat and then it falls off 0.", 
    "Log-log, it just keeps on falling off.", 
    "The equation for this is 1 over 1 plus RCj omega, 1 over", 
    "1 plus RCs.", 
    "And over here, when omega is small, at low frequencies,", 
    "this is approximately 1/1.", 
    "So you see a straight line.", 
    "And when omega is large, it's", 
    "approximately 1 over RCj omega.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: So it's a hyperbola.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: The absolute value of that is 1", 
    "over just RC omega.", 
    "So it looks like a hyperbola if you look", 
    "at the linear domain--", 
    "or sorry, if you look at the linear axis.", 
    "And if you look at the logarithmic axis--", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: It falls off just as a straight line.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: Straight line at 20 decibles per decade.", 
    "GERRY SUSSMAN: I just want to make it very", 
    "clear, by the way.", 
    "I didn't label this.", 
    "This is the input voltage, vi, and this is the output", 
    "voltage, vo, and for the thing we just did here.", 
    "So this is vi over vo,", 
    "magnitude, and this is frequency.", 
    "PIOTR MITROS: So that's what you're going to see over the", 
    "next few lectures."
