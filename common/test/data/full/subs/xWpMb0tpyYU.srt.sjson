    "SPEAKER 1: Finally, let me work up a", 
    "couple of more examples.", 
    "And using these examples, my hope is that I can show you", 
    "that these will directly relate to some of the", 
    "interesting voltages that you saw in the very first part of", 
    "the sequence where you saw these really, really funky", 
    "voltages across the intermediate node in the", 
    "inverter chain.", 
    "So you recall the inverter pair, A, B, and C. A had nice", 
    "clean waves.", 
    "And in B you recall we saw wave forms", 
    "that look like this.", 
    "And I will show you now why these wave", 
    "forms have these shapes.", 
    "So we're are pretty much close to being able to show that.", 
    "And let me go and switch colors here to green.", 
    "And you recall I used green for these wave forms in the", 
    "very first par of the sequence.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is give you a little example.", 
    "And I'll do two examples.", 
    "So I have to two pairs of axes here for each of the examples.", 
    "So in the first example, I am going to pick the following", 
    "set of parameters.", 
    "For the first set of parameters, I'm going to pick", 
    "the initial value in the capacitor V0 to be 0 volts.", 
    "So this you just recall, this is vC of 0 and the initial", 
    "voltage on the capacitor to be 0 volts.", 
    "And my input VI, which is my input voltage VI of t, I'm", 
    "picking that to be a DCVI.", 
    "And let me pick that to be 5 volts.", 
    "And how might this scenario arise in the kind of circuit", 
    "we looked at?", 
    "So recall the circuit he had was voltage vC , resistor R, a", 
    "capacitor, here's my ground, capacitor C, and this node", 
    "voltage vC .", 
    "So the first scenario is one where my initial voltage in", 
    "the capacitor V0 equals 0.", 
    "So that's my initial voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "That's been given to me as 0.", 
    "So my circuit is starting from rest. My capacitor has no", 
    "voltage across it.", 
    "It's starting from rest. There's no", 
    "charge in the capacitor.", 
    "And I'm saying that at time t equal to zero my VI is going", 
    "to be 5 volts.", 
    "And the way I can cause that to happen is if VI flips from", 
    "0 volts to 5 volts at times t equal to 0.", 
    "In other words, if this VI here takes a step input from 0", 
    "volts to 5 volts at time t equal to 0, then I can get the", 
    "conditions that I have here, which is my input voltage of", 
    "the capacitor is 0 at time t equal to 0 and then", 
    "instantaneously VI takes a jump from 0 to 5 volts and", 
    "that will give me 5 volts VI.", 
    "So in a situation like that, if I were to plot for t", 
    "greater than or equal to 0, what do I have?", 
    "So V0 equals 0 and VI equals 5 volts.", 
    "Let me go ahead and rewrite my capacitor voltage.", 
    "Remember I did this before.", 
    "vC is VI plus V0 minus VI and e raised to minus", 
    "t divided by RC.", 
    "So I use that equation and what do I get?", 
    "So at time t equal to 0 VI and VI cancel so vC equals V0.", 
    "And so therefore my starting value in the capacitor is 0", 
    "volts and that's because V0 is 0 volts.", 
    "And then at time t equals infinity, what do I see?", 
    "At time t equals infinity, this thing goes to 0 and so vC", 
    "is simply the same as the input voltage VI.", 
    "So if this is VI here and I start out down here and after", 
    "a long interval, after a large value of t, I end up there,", 
    "and so this is how things look.", 
    "So this is how things will look.", 
    "And substituting in VI and V0, this curve is given by 5 minus", 
    "5 e raised to minus t divided by RC.", 
    "So this is what used to be what I've been calling V0 and", 
    "this is VI, the final voltage on the capacitor.", 
    "So notice how I get this nice little rise and then I have a", 
    "flattening out as I hit the value VI.", 
    "And again, intuitively what's happening here is there's 0", 
    "volts in the capacitor initially so it's 0.", 
    "And then so the capacitor starts to charge up because", 
    "there's a current flowing.", 
    "So instantaneously at time t equal to 0, the current", 
    "flowing will be VI minus 0 divided by R. That will be the", 
    "instantaneous value of the current that will flow at time", 
    "t equals 0 and that's because this is 5 volts, the voltage", 
    "across the capacitor is 0, and so there will be a current", 
    "flowing here, and that will start", 
    "charging up the capacitor.", 
    "And notice that if the voltage in the capacitor charges up,", 
    "then the current that will be flowing will become smaller", 
    "and smaller.", 
    "Initially it's VI minus 0, but as vC burns up, this current", 
    "becomes smaller and smaller.", 
    "So of the growth in vC becomes smaller and smaller.", 
    "That will be my flattening out of the curve.", 
    "So it starts out at VI divided by R current and then over", 
    "time the current decreases because the capacitor voltage", 
    "keeps increasing so that the potential difference across", 
    "the resistor becomes smaller and smaller.", 
    "And then finally it becomes 0 and the current goes to 0.", 
    "So that's the first scenario on the left-hand side."
