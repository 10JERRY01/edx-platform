    "SPEAKER 1: So let the drum rolls begin.", 
    "OK, what is it saying here?", 
    "If you recall, omega naught by 2 alpha, this was none other,", 
    "our good old Q. OK, recall when we did the time during", 
    "analysis of second order circuits, we defined omega", 
    "naught by 2 alpha as Q.", 
    "And what have we shown here?", 
    "OK, through this sequence of math, what we've shown here is", 
    "that the magnitude of the response across the capacitor", 
    "at resonance, when s is equal to j omega, when s equals j", 
    "omega naught of omega equals omega naught, we've shown that", 
    "the magnitude of the response, the transfer function, Vc over", 
    "Vi, is equal to Q. OK, in other words, at resonance, my", 
    "output is going to be, Vc going to be Q times Vi.", 
    "Isn't that amazing?", 
    "So in terms of my picture here, what happens here?", 
    "In terms of my picture, here's my omega naught.", 
    "But what this is saying is-- and if this line is 1, what", 
    "this is saying is that, at omega naught, my response, my", 
    "transfer function, is going to be equal Q. So let's say my Q", 
    "value is somewhere here.", 
    "Let's say Q is greater than 1, OK?", 
    "So example, Q might be 5, for instance.", 
    "OK, it could be anything.", 
    "OK, my Q is up here, so what that means is, at this point,", 
    "the response is going to be right here.", 
    "So if I have an input sinusoid, Vi equals sine omega", 
    "t, what that is saying is that the magnitude of the Vc when", 
    "the input is Vi equals sine omega naught t, if the input", 
    "sinusoid has a frequency equal to the resonant frequency, so", 
    "the input is Vi cosine omega naught t, then the response,", 
    "Vc, is going to be, the amplitude at the response of", 
    "Vc is going to be Q times that of Vi.", 
    "In other words, out here, my curve is not going to look", 
    "just like this.", 
    "But it's going to go something like this.", 
    "OK, isn't this amazing?", 
    "OK, let me just draw it a little more cleanly here.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "So what happens at omega naught, I have a very, very", 
    "sharp peak, OK?", 
    "And this peak in this relates to Q. Let me write that down.", 
    "OK, so this peak in this of the response of the omega", 
    "naught relates to Q.", 
    "OK, so this is this big aha that you've just discovered", 
    "here, which is that, when I drive a RLC circuit, the", 
    "resonant circuit, with an input sinusoid that is at the", 
    "resonant frequency--", 
    "OK, in other words, if I drive it at something like Vi cosine", 
    "omega naught t or an omega that is", 
    "close to omega naught--", 
    "then my response, Vc, the magnitude of the response at", 
    "Vc is going to be Q times that of the input, OK?", 
    "And if the circuit has Q given by omega naught divided by 2", 
    "alpha, if omega naught divided by 2 alpha is greater than 1,", 
    "then this response is going to be greater than the input, OK?", 
    "And so the amplitude of the sinusoid across C will be", 
    "greater than the amplitude of the input sinusoid.", 
    "OK, so now I've built a circuit where I can get", 
    "responses that are greater in amplitude than the responses", 
    "at the input.", 
    "OK, this is absolutely amazing and is useful for many, many", 
    "different kinds of circuits.", 
    "It can be bad as well.", 
    "And this, for example, is one explanation.", 
    "So this is one reason why, if you have a platoon of soldiers", 
    "walking across a bridge, they are asked to break step.", 
    "Because if they're all walking in step in a repeating step", 
    "pattern where all of them are completely synchronized, and", 
    "if they approach the resonate frequency of the bridge, what", 
    "this is saying is that the bridge can demonstrate a", 
    "response that builds up and can grossly exceed the input", 
    "response, OK?", 
    "And the bridge could collapse.", 
    "Which is why the platoon soldiers and such groups are", 
    "asked to break step so they all go out of sync as they", 
    "cross a bridge.", 
    "The same thing happened in the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster", 
    "where the winds were such that some of the eddy winds and so", 
    "on that were buffeting the bridge gave rise to a really", 
    "funky sinusoidal, really funky alternating pattern that", 
    "approached the resonant frequency of the bridge.", 
    "And the bridge began to sway, OK?", 
    "The bridge began to sway to the point where it finally", 
    "crashed, OK?", 
    "It broke up and crashed.", 
    "So now you understand why I had a little bridge drawn in a", 
    "few sequences ago.", 
    "But you may wonder why does this happen?", 
    "OK, it seems counter-intuitive, OK?", 
    "Why is it that the response across a capacitor keeps", 
    "increasing?", 
    "OK, after all, we do have a resistor here.", 
    "Why does a response across a capacitor keep building up?", 
    "Well, the answer is pretty simple.", 
    "Notice that Q is omega naught divided by 2 alpha.", 
    "And alpha is related to R. So when alpha becomes small, in", 
    "other words, if R becomes small, what happens now?", 
    "So now there is energy being stored in this LC circuit, OK?", 
    "So I have an inductor and capacitor after all.", 
    "And energy is being stored here.", 
    "And R is dissipating that energy.", 
    "Now if R is made small enough, then the rate of energy", 
    "dissipation from this circuit will be much lower.", 
    "OK, the rate of dissipation by R will be much lower than the", 
    "rate of injection of energy by the input source.", 
    "And at the resonate frequency, if R is small enough, then if", 
    "I'm injecting energy at the resonant frequency, and if R", 
    "is small enough, then energy can build up in", 
    "the circuit, OK?", 
    "So the energy can, for every cycle of the sinusoid, it", 
    "contributes more energy into the circuit.", 
    "And so the circuit keeps storing more and more and more", 
    "energy, until the response goes up all the way to Q, Q", 
    "times the input.", 
    "And that's what's going on.", 
    "OK, of course, if R is pretty big, then R will dissipate", 
    "that energy causing the response not to peak.", 
    "But if R becomes smaller, Q increases, OK?", 
    "And as the circuit becomes a high Q, the system becomes a", 
    "high Q system, then it will be storing more energy per cycle", 
    "at the resonant frequency than dissipating it.", 
    "And that is what is causing the response to grow all the", 
    "way up to Q.", 
    "This also explains how a swing works.", 
    "OK, all of you have seen--", 
    "so if I have a tree here and let's have a branch here and a", 
    "nice little tree.", 
    "All of you have played with a swing.", 
    "So here is a swing.", 
    "OK, how do you make a swing swing back and forth with a", 
    "big enough amplitude?", 
    "Well, what you do is, as the swing is swinging back and", 
    "forth, at the right time, when the swing reaches this point,", 
    "you give it a little push.", 
    "OK, you keep giving it pushes at the right time, so that the", 
    "swing will keep swinging at its resonant frequency.", 
    "And you keep giving it a push exactly at that time, you will", 
    "keep imparting energy to it.", 
    "And the energy will keep building up.", 
    "And the swing will swing with greater and greater amplitude.", 
    "OK, it's all the same basic principle, OK?", 
    "So here you've seen a circuit that can have a", 
    "really peaked response.", 
    "And because of this peaked response, I can have much", 
    "greater values at intermediate points in the circuit than", 
    "even imparted by the input."
