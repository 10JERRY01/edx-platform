    "SPEAKER 1: Let's now begin solving our differential", 
    "equation using the method of homogeneous", 
    "and particular solutions.", 
    "So here is our differential equation.", 
    "It's a first-order differential equation.", 
    "RC dvC dt plus vC equals VI.", 
    "VI is the constant input source, and we're also given", 
    "that the initial voltage on the capacitor at time t is", 
    "equal to 0, is given by V0.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So let's start with the first step of the method of", 
    "homogeneous and particular solutions.", 
    "The first step is to find the particular solution.", 
    "So what is the particular solution?", 
    "The particular solution is any solution that satisfies the", 
    "original differential equation.", 
    "So the original equation is this one, marked X. And the", 
    "particular solution, vCP, is any solution that satisfies", 
    "the original equation.", 
    "And so here's where our guesswork begins.", 
    "So in general, we use trial and error, guesswork, to find", 
    "some solution that satisfies the original equation.", 
    "So let's start with our guesswork.", 
    "So our particular equation to which we have to find a", 
    "particular solution--", 
    "I'm just going to copy that out here.", 
    "RC dvCP by dt plus vCP equals VI.", 
    "So all I've done here is that I need to find-- this is my", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "It's the same equation as here.", 
    "And I need to find a particular solution.", 
    "And so if vCP is a particular solution to my differential", 
    "equation, then vCP must satisfy this equation.", 
    "So I've substituted vC to be vCP, and any solution for vCP", 
    "that makes this equation come true is a workable solution.", 
    "So let's guess.", 
    "What is a solution that makes this work?", 
    "So this is really, really simple.", 
    "I'm going to let you try to figure out and guess a", 
    "solution that makes this equation work.", 
    "And think of the simplest possible solution that works.", 
    "So at the end of the sentence, I recommend that you pause", 
    "this video and try to guess at a solution.", 
    "And then once you've made a guess, then why don't you", 
    "start the video again.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So hopefully you've had a chance to", 
    "guess at the solution.", 
    "So what do you think?", 
    "So the first derivative of something times RC, the thing", 
    "itself, is equal to VI.", 
    "So notice that if I choose vCP equals VI, then this works.", 
    "This is the simplest thing I could think of.", 
    "Let's try it out.", 
    "So let me plug in VI for RC.", 
    "And recall, VI was the constant", 
    "value of my input source.", 
    "And so let me substitute in for vCP.", 
    "So I get RC d by dt of vCP.", 
    "So I've chosen to vCP to be VI.", 
    "Plus VI, equals VI.", 
    "and I want to check if this is true.", 
    "In this case, I've substituted VI for vCP, so right away, I", 
    "can notice that the time derivative of a", 
    "constant, VI, goes to 0.", 
    "So that's knocked off, and so I'm pretty happy here.", 
    "Both sides of my equation are the same, and so therefore VI", 
    "is a solution that works.", 
    "The first step of the three-step process to solving", 
    "my differential equation.", 
    "So that was extremely painless and very easy.", 
    "I simply did it by guessing at a solution for the", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "All right.", 
    "I am now ready to move on to the second step of solving the", 
    "differential equation using the method of homogeneous and", 
    "particular solutions.", 
    "So on the right-hand side is the same equation and the", 
    "initial condition again.", 
    "And my second step of the homogeneous and particular", 
    "solutions is to find vCH, the homogeneous solution.", 
    "So vCH is the homogeneous solution, and it is the", 
    "solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "What is the homogeneous equation?", 
    "Well, it is the original differential equation with the", 
    "drive set to 0.", 
    "So if you look at this equation here, VI is the input", 
    "drive voltage.", 
    "So the homogeneous equation is simply that equation here with", 
    "the input drive set to 0.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So let me write that out.", 
    "So the solution to that equation will be vCH.", 
    "So by dt, plus vCH, and I've set the drive to 0.", 
    "So I'm going to denote this as equation Y. So that is the", 
    "homogeneous equation.", 
    "So I need to find a solution, vCH, that satisfies this", 
    "homogeneous equation with the drive set to 0.", 
    "So how do I've solve the second part?", 
    "Well, you guessed it, I'm going to use guesswork again.", 
    "I'm going to use guesswork to solve this equation again.", 
    "And I'm going to guess at a solution", 
    "and see if that works.", 
    "So I need some solution where the sum of the first", 
    "derivative and the solution itself must equal 0.", 
    "So think about some form of a solution where the derivative", 
    "of the expression is the expression", 
    "itself times some constant.", 
    "So again, I encourage you to pause me, pause the video at", 
    "the end of this sentence, and think of a solution yourself", 
    "before I go and tell you the answer.", 
    "So let me go ahead and, now that you've had a chance to", 
    "think about what the solution might look like, let me go", 
    "ahead and tell you the answer.", 
    "So recall, I need to find something whose first", 
    "derivative is the same as that something itself.", 
    "Of course, there will be a minus sign in there so that", 
    "they cancel out.", 
    "But fundamentally, the form of the solution should be the", 
    "same form in its first derivative.", 
    "So the first thing that comes to mind is an exponentiation.", 
    "So let me try a solution of the following form.", 
    "So vCH equals some unknown constant, Ae, raised to st. So", 
    "I'm going to assume a solution of this form.", 
    "And the question is, I need to figure out what A", 
    "is and what s is.", 
    "I don't know what A and s are.", 
    "But notice that, again, I've gone and used guesswork here,", 
    "and I've guessed at the solution.", 
    "And I suspect that this might work, because when I take the", 
    "derivative of Ae to the st, then the derivative will cause", 
    "s to come out, but fundamentally it will still", 
    "remain as [? e to the s too ?]", 
    "in its expression.", 
    "So I have a chance that the two can be made to be equal.", 
    "So let me go ahead and substitute this for vCH and", 
    "see if I can make it work, by finding out", 
    "values for A and s.", 
    "So let me go ahead and substitute the vCH in terms of", 
    "Ae to the st. So I get RC d by dt of Ae raised to the st,", 
    "plus Ae raised to the st. And that must equal 0.", 
    "So let me go ahead and now take the", 
    "derivative by the next step.", 
    "So it's RC times--", 
    "so A is a constant, so I can pull it out.", 
    "And the derivative of e to the st is simply se to the st. And", 
    "then here, I just have Ae to the st, and that equals 0.", 
    "So right here, I need to find a value for A and s such that", 
    "this is true.", 
    "Of course, I can pick A equals 0, which is a trivial", 
    "solution, and set that to 0.", 
    "But I'm going to discard that trivial solution.", 
    "So I'm going to discard the trivial", 
    "solution, A equals 0 solution.", 
    "So I'm going to choose A not equal to 0, and get a", 
    "nontrivial solution.", 
    "So if A is not equal to 0, I can do the following things.", 
    "Let me start by canceling out A from both terms, and then I", 
    "can also cancel out e to the st from both these terms. And", 
    "so what am I left with?", 
    "I am left with RCs plus 1 equals 0.", 
    "This is an extremely important equation.", 
    "We will see this form of equation come up again and", 
    "again and again.", 
    "And I'm going to call this a characteristic equation.", 
    "The characteristic equation comes up in the solution where", 
    "I'm finding out the homogeneous solution to the", 
    "differential equation, when I'm looking to find vCH.", 
    "And so the characteristic equation comes up when I", 
    "substitute A to the st in the equation.", 
    "And so I get 1 plus RCs equals 0, and so right there I can", 
    "find my value for one of my unknowns, s,", 
    "to make it all work.", 
    "And I get minus 1 divided by RC.", 
    "So if s is 1 divided by RC, then Ae to the st can be a", 
    "reasonable solution.", 
    "In other words, my homogeneous solution is vCH is equal to Ae", 
    "raised to st. But s is given by 1 by RC, and there's my t.", 
    "So this RC thing here--", 
    "RC is called a time constant, tau.", 
    "And I use the notation for the time constant, and I give it a", 
    "notation, tau.", 
    "So notice that it must have time units, because it's t", 
    "divided by RC.", 
    "And so in my time constant here, this RC clearly has", 
    "units of time.", 
    "And I knew that earlier, as well.", 
    "Notice here that this is a voltage and this is the", 
    "voltage, and so RC and dt must have the same units.", 
    "And so RC has units of time, and that is", 
    "called my time constant.", 
    "So vCH equals Ae raised to minus 1 by RC.", 
    "But I can write that in terms of time constant as well.", 
    "A raised to minus 1 by minus t, divided by tau.", 
    "So I now have my particular solution and I also have the", 
    "homogeneous solution.", 
    "So I am two steps into my solution of the first-order", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "And notice it was just very, very simple.", 
    "In both cases, I guessed at a solution and I simply", 
    "developed the constants to make it all work.", 
    "Notice I still do not know the value of A. I still do not", 
    "know the value of A, and hopefully I can figure it out", 
    "in my final step, when I substitute in the initial", 
    "conditions and so on."
