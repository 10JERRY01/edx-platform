    "SPEAKER 1: The network we saw in the previous example, in", 
    "the motivating example, contained a resistor, inductor", 
    "and a capacitor, OK?", 
    "It was what we call an RLC circuit.", 
    "So the previous circuit was an RLC circuit.", 
    "So what I'd like to do is do it one step at a time.", 
    "Let's do a simpler circuit, just the LC circuit.", 
    "And that will itself give us a bunch of intuition.", 
    "And then, in the next sequence, I will introduce a", 
    "resistor into the circuit.", 
    "So let's start with a LC circuit of the following form.", 
    "So let's have some input vI of t, have an inductor L, and", 
    "connect that to a capacitor C. And let us say that the", 
    "capacitor has voltage v of t across it, and the current", 
    "through the inductor and through the capacitor is i.", 
    "So vI of t is the input.", 
    "I have the current i of t going to the inductor, and", 
    "since it's a series circuit, the same current i of t will", 
    "also flow through the capacitor.", 
    "And the capacitor has a voltage v of t across it.", 
    "And just remember, we will introduce R into the circuit", 
    "in the next sequence.", 
    "And here let's just look at this much simpler circuit.", 
    "Let me just write that down so you remember it.", 
    "All right, so I want to solve this circuit", 
    "using the node method.", 
    "So what I want you to understand is, going forward,", 
    "it is all going to be about the node method.", 
    "And once we write the equation that comes out of the node", 
    "method, it will be complete math.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's go ahead and write down the node method.", 
    "And in order to do that, one of the first things that I", 
    "have to do is pick a ground node.", 
    "Because I want to pick this as my ground node.", 
    "And if I pick this as my ground node, then the node", 
    "voltage here is going to be v. OK?", 
    "So let me go ahead and use the node method", 
    "to solve this circuit.", 
    "So, moving on.", 
    "So I show the circuit here.", 
    "And notice the current i of t flows through both the", 
    "capacitor and the inductor, because they're in series.", 
    "The ground node here, and my node", 
    "voltage is v. All right.", 
    "So, recall the node method.", 
    "Since I have a voltage source here, I already know the node", 
    "voltage here, which is simply vI.", 
    "I've been careful in choosing my ground node to be one", 
    "terminal of the voltage source, and so, right away, I", 
    "have found the voltage at this node.", 
    "So all I'm left with is one unknown node voltage here.", 
    "And recall the node method.", 
    "The node method, all I have to do is I have to sum the", 
    "current going into the node with the unknown voltage.", 
    "Just sum the currents as zero, or I can sum the currents", 
    "leaving the node, and they will add up to zero.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So I have to add up the currents into the node from", 
    "the inductor, and into the node from the capacitor.", 
    "So let's do each of these things.", 
    "OK, so what is the current through the capacitor in terms", 
    "of the node voltage?", 
    "Well, that's pretty easy.", 
    "The current through the capacitor, I know, is i of t,", 
    "and that is simply given by C dv dt.", 
    "v is the node voltage, and so the current through the", 
    "capacitor is simply C dv dt.", 
    "That's i of t, because that's the", 
    "current through the capacitor.", 
    "I could do the same thing for the inductor.", 
    "And so, what is the current through the inductor in terms", 
    "of the node voltages?", 
    "So recall for an inductor, the voltage across an inductor is", 
    "related to L di dt.", 
    "So for an inductor, the current through the inductor", 
    "is i, and if the current is i, then the voltage across the", 
    "inductor is equal to L di dt.", 
    "So this is the v across inductor.", 
    "So the voltage across the inductor is L di dt.", 
    "And in this case, what is the voltage?", 
    "Well, that voltage is simply vI minus v. OK?", 
    "So vI minus v is the voltage across the inductor, and that", 
    "is simply equal to L di dt.", 
    "So now, I'm ready to proceed with the node equation.", 
    "Oh, but before I do that, let me just go ahead and express", 
    "the inductor current not in its differential form, but use", 
    "the integral form here.", 
    "So I can go and integrate both sides with respect to t, and", 
    "divide throughout by L. So let's say I bring L to this", 
    "side, and then integrate it, what do I get?", 
    "I get 1 by L, I integrate minus infinity to t vI minus v", 
    "dt, and that is equal to i.", 
    "So it's di dt up here, and by integrating both sides, I get", 
    "the following equation.", 
    "So right here I have this is i of t.", 
    "So notice that i of t flows through both the inductor and", 
    "the capacitor, and so I can simply add them up, and they", 
    "showed sum to zero.", 
    "So the i of t through the inductor must equal i of t", 
    "through the capacitor.", 
    "So, in this particular situation, I notice that i of", 
    "t is entering node v, and here i of t is leaving node v.", 
    "So I can write it as the inductor current minus the", 
    "capacitor current is zero.", 
    "Or I could simply equate the two, and I can write the", 
    "expression like so.", 
    "I can simply write them as 1 by L minus infinity to t vI", 
    "minus v dt equals C dv dt.", 
    "Pretty straightforward.", 
    "OK, so there I get my equation relating the node voltage v,", 
    "and I have an equation that derived", 
    "from the node equation.", 
    "So let me get rid of the integral sign here and", 
    "simplify it a little bit and differentiate throughout with", 
    "respect to t, and what do I get?", 
    "I get 1 by L vI minus v equals C d squared v by dt squared.", 
    "And then I can just move things around a little bit,", 
    "and what do I get?", 
    "If I move things around and multiply throughout by L, so I", 
    "get LC d squared v by dt squared, so that's this part.", 
    "And then I move v to the right hand side, so I get plus v,", 
    "and vI remains on one side, so that is equal to vI.", 
    "So this is my equation that governs the", 
    "dynamics of this circuit.", 
    "It's LC d squared v by dt squared plus v equals vI.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So I've just used the node equation and equated the", 
    "currents entering the node to be 0, and then I've gotten", 
    "this equation.", 
    "The current through the inductor in terms of the", 
    "inductor voltages was given by this expression here.", 
    "And the current through the capacitor, in terms of the", 
    "capacitor node voltage, was given here.", 
    "Right?", 
    "So those two are equal, and that's how I got the final", 
    "expression, the final equation for the node voltage.", 
    "So notice, first of all, that this is the second order", 
    "equation, OK?", 
    "I have the second derivative of v, LC d", 
    "squared v by dt squared.", 
    "So the second order systems are governed by second order", 
    "differential equations.", 
    "Also notice that I have a vI here and I have a vI here, so", 
    "each of these terms must have a units of voltage, which", 
    "means that this is the second difference of v so that's", 
    "still a voltage.", 
    "So what that means is that LC--", 
    "let me change colors here so it's a little bit cleaner--", 
    "so LC here has units of time squared.", 
    "So it's dt squared in the denominator.", 
    "And so LC must have units of time squared.", 
    "And in this particular circuit, in the second order", 
    "circuits, both v and i are state variables.", 
    "And you will see that when I go into solving the", 
    "differential equations related to this, I will need the", 
    "initial conditions on both of these state variables.", 
    "So I'll need an initial condition of the voltage", 
    "across the capacitor and an initial condition on the", 
    "current through the inductor.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So there's my equation and my work is cut out for me.", 
    "I need to go and solve the second order", 
    "differential equation."
