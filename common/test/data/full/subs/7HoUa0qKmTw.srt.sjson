    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "So now you will see your quality factor making another", 
    "grand reappearance.", 
    "We just simply cannot seem to get rid of Q, OK, so let's", 
    "write down some of the things that we know.", 
    "So we know that delta omega from what we just calculated", 
    "is R over L. We also know that omega equals the square root", 
    "of I over LC.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "And we also know from the past that 2 alpha was equal to R", 
    "divided by L. OK, right there you'll see", 
    "where we are headed.", 
    "So omega 0 by delta omega, which was indicative of", 
    "selectivity, OK, is--", 
    "let me just write that down.", 
    "OK, that tells you the selectivity of your filter.", 
    "Delta omega being in that order implies a", 
    "more selective filter.", 
    "So we know that this is omega not.", 
    "And we just figured out that delta omega is R", 
    "divided by L, OK?", 
    "So what do we find here?", 
    "So omega not stays the same, but R over L is 2 alpha.", 
    "So here is another aha moment.", 
    "OK, how many sequences have you seen with two", 
    "aha moments in there?", 
    "So this is again nothing but Q.", 
    "OK, so this alpha you see from here.", 
    "So therefore, Q is nothing but omega not by delta omega.", 
    "And this could be taken as another definition of Q. OK, Q", 
    "for a circuit is simply omega not the resonant frequency of", 
    "the circuit divided by the bandwidth of", 
    "the frequency response.", 
    "OK, I can--", 
    "if I substitute, if I know that omega not equals 1 by the", 
    "square root of LC and delta omega is R over L, I could", 
    "substitute those values and get Q in terms of the exact", 
    "circuit parameters.", 
    "OK, I could also write down Q in terms of R over L, and so", 
    "omega not L over R. OK, we know that omega not is 1 by", 
    "the square root of LC.", 
    "And so here's my Q in terms of circuit parameters.", 
    "So, not surprisingly, the lower the R for the series RLC", 
    "circuit, OK, the more selective is the circuit, OK?", 
    "So if it's a series circuit, the lower the R,", 
    "the sharper the peak.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Or the more selective the filter.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So what this is saying is that selectivity depends on Q. OK,", 
    "so high q implies high selectivity.", 
    "OK, so now we've seen a whole bunch of places where Q keeps", 
    "showing up.", 
    "OK, so here we saw that high Q means high selectivity.", 
    "We saw in our time [UNINTELLIGIBLE] analysis a", 
    "high Q implied more ringing, more cycles of", 
    "ringing of the circuit.", 
    "And in a previous video, we saw that the peakiness, how", 
    "peaky the response was, in other words, when I took the", 
    "voltage, when I measured the response across the capacitor,", 
    "the factor by which that was greater than the base response", 
    "was related to Q again.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So peakiness, sharpness, amount of rings, all can be", 
    "easily related to Q, So you can see that this q is this", 
    "amazing thing, that once you figure out Q for a circuit,", 
    "you can tell all kinds of things about that circuit."
