    "SPEAKER 1: At this point, I&#39;d\nlike to do a quick summary of", 
    "all that we have covered\nin 6.002 so far.", 
    "We began life in 6.002 by\ndiscretizing matter into", 
    "lumped elements.", 
    "And we agreed to observe the\nlumped matter discipline.", 
    "What this did was it turned\nreal life elements, as our", 
    "little pickle on which we\nperformed the fun experiment a", 
    "little while ago.", 
    "And we were able to turn that\ninto lumped elements, such as", 
    "a resistor, which we could\nuse in circuits to obtain", 
    "properties such as voltages\nand currents.", 
    "And when we took these lumped\nelements and put them together", 
    "into circuits, we got the lumped\ncircuit abstraction.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So once we built these circuits\ncontaining these", 
    "lumped elements, we then went\non to develop an arsenal of", 
    "tools that we could use\nto analyze circuits.", 
    "So notice that the fun\npart of 6.002 doubled", 
    "has really not begun.", 
    "We just made some assumptions\nthat allowed us to make the", 
    "transition from physics and the\ncomplications of Maxwell&#39;s", 
    "equations into some very simple\nterritories where", 
    "algebraic equations rule.", 
    "And then, we sat down and\ndeveloped some analysis", 
    "techniques for the circuits\nthat we built.", 
    "Notice we really haven&#39;t built\nanything useful or", 
    "done any fun stuff.", 
    "We are still developing\nour tools for the", 
    "circuits that we created.", 
    "So we developed a bunch of\ncircuit analysis methods.", 
    "We started off with the\nKVL, KCL method.", 
    "And in this method, you\ntook a circuit.", 
    "And you wrote the KVL, KCL\nequations and also the I-V", 
    "relations for each\nof the elements.", 
    "And then you got a whole series\nof linear equations.", 
    "And we went and solved them.", 
    "The second technique we\nlearned was applying", 
    "simplification rules, where\nyou combine resistances in", 
    "series and so on and so forth,\na resistance in parallel or a", 
    "voltage in series, and\nthen used those to", 
    "simplify the circuit.", 
    "The third method that we\ndeveloped was the node method.", 
    "The node method is really the\nworkhorse of our industry.", 
    "When in doubt, use\nthe node method.", 
    "The node method applies to all\ncircuits and, in fact, is used", 
    "for linear or nonlinear\ncircuits.", 
    "And by and large, when\nin doubt, we just", 
    "apply the node method.", 
    "So if you look at these\ntechniques here, they apply to", 
    "any network.", 
    "And then, we looked at another\nclass of techniques, the", 
    "superposition, Thevenin,\nand Norton.", 
    "In the superposition method, we\nsimplified a circuit into", 
    "subcircuits by shutting off\nall sources save for one.", 
    "And then we found the\nsubcircuit result.", 
    "And then we added up\nall the results.", 
    "That was the superposition\nmethod.", 
    "And then we learned about the\nThevenin and Norton methods.", 
    "The Thevenin method, it\ndetermined a Thevenin pattern", 
    "circuit to replace an arbitrary\nnetwork, while the", 
    "Norton method replaced an\narbitrary circuit with the", 
    "Norton pattern.", 
    "Now, don&#39;t forget that the\nsuperposition, Thevenin, and", 
    "Norton methods apply only\nto linear circuits.", 
    "So these techniques,\nsuperposition, Thevenin and", 
    "Norton, are extremely\npowerful.", 
    "And they will work with\nlinear networks.", 
    "And we will see a lot of\nsituations where we have", 
    "linear networks.", 
    "And so these are very important\ntechniques.", 
    "And then, of course, for\nnonlinear networks, or for", 
    "networks that contain nonlinear\nelements, we will", 
    "largely use the node method,\nwhere the node method is", 
    "really the workhorse\nof our industry.", 
    "Now people often ask me, when\ndo I use which technique?", 
    "You&#39;ve taught us the KVL, KCL\nmethod, the node method, the", 
    "Norton method.", 
    "Where do I apply these\ntechniques?", 
    "The way to think about it is\njust imagine if you are a", 
    "carpenter, and you have a tool\nchest full of tools.", 
    "You know, you have a chisel.", 
    "You have a screwdriver.", 
    "And you have my favorite\ntool, a chainsaw.", 
    "So you have all of\nthese tools.", 
    "And if you asked a carpenter,\nwell, where do you use which", 
    "tool, what do you expect the\ncarpenter would respond?", 
    "The carpenter would say, well,\nthat&#39;s why you pay a carpenter", 
    "the big bucks.", 
    "They know what tool to use\nwhere, and they&#39;re practiced", 
    "in using it.", 
    "Similarly, as engineers, as\nyou get more practice, you", 
    "will begin using these tools\nand beginning to figure out", 
    "where to use what tool.", 
    "But fundamentally, the\nsuperposition, Thevenin, and", 
    "Norton methods apply\nto linear networks.", 
    "And the node method\napplies anywhere.", 
    "So when in doubt, just\nuse the node method.", 
    "And much like a carpenter would\nuse a chainsaw to chop", 
    "down a tree, you can use your\nsuperposition method to", 
    "analyze circuits that contain a\nnumber of sources, where you", 
    "can break it down into very\nsimple subcircuits.", 
    "But of course, the circuit has\nto be linear to begin with.", 
    "So really, you will develop\nexperience in terms of where", 
    "to apply which method.", 
    "But again, don&#39;t forget that the\nnode method will apply in", 
    "any situation.",
