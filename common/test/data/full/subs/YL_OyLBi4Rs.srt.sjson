    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so this diagram gives us a very interesting", 
    "kind of transfer function.", 
    "I'm going to plot vi versus vo in this diagram.", 
    "So recall I said that the world started", 
    "off at plus 15 volts.", 
    "OK, so the world started off at plus 15 volts here.", 
    "It started off at plus 15 volts.", 
    "And let's say my input ke kept getting", 
    "more and more positive.", 
    "So my input kept getting more and more", 
    "positive, so from here--", 
    "so this is VS, and let's say minus VS is here--", 
    "so let's say my input kept getting", 
    "more and more positive.", 
    "So this is 15 volts.", 
    "My input vi kept getting more and more positive", 
    "until it hit 7.5 volts.", 
    "The moment the input hit 7.5 volts, so vi, this was the", 
    "same as v minus, as soon as it hit 7.5 volts, boom, my output", 
    "dropped to minus 15 volts.", 
    "And then if my input kept increasing, I would stay at", 
    "minus 15 volts.", 
    "No change.", 
    "I would stay at minus 15 volts.", 
    "Now, at that point, let's say my input began", 
    "to get smaller values.", 
    "If my input began to become smaller, then as my input", 
    "began to get smaller, no change again.", 
    "No change in the output.", 
    "Output stays at minus 15 volts.", 
    "Remember, no change until my input gets to minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "Recall the state diagram that we drew earlier, the state", 
    "diagram looked like this, 15 volts, v0, v0", 
    "equals minus 15 volts.", 
    "And then I switched from the plus 15 state to the minus 15", 
    "state when vi became greater than 7.5 volts.", 
    "And then I stayed in that state until vi became less", 
    "than minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "So this diagram here simply reflects that.", 
    "So as vi becomes smaller and smaller, hits 0, no change,", 
    "and eventually vi hits minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "When vi hits minus 7.5 volts, boom, I get a change in the", 
    "output, and I go back to the plus 15 state.", 
    "Go back to the plus 15 volt state.", 
    "I stay in that state even as vi goes", 
    "more and more negative.", 
    "What happens next?", 
    "So now let's say vi becomes positive, vi becomes more and", 
    "more positive, and so I start heading in this direction.", 
    "So vi becomes more and more positive, and vi becomes 0, no", 
    "change, I stay at 15 volts until vi becomes 7.5 volts.", 
    "When vi becomes 7.5 volts, I switch to the minus 15 state,", 
    "and then vi can keep increasing and I", 
    "don't switch states.", 
    "So this property, we notice that the output of the circuit", 
    "depends on where I came from.", 
    "Notice that at any given point-- so let's", 
    "say my input is here.", 
    "I pick an input.", 
    "Let's say my input is 3 volts If I tell you my input is 3", 
    "volts, I can't tell you whether my output is going to", 
    "be here or here.", 
    "It could be either.", 
    "And the output will depend on where I came from.", 
    "If I'm coming from here, then it would be plus 15 volts, but", 
    "if I came from this direction, it'll be minus 15 volts.", 
    "So the output is a memory property here.", 
    "The circuit remembers the past. And that is called", 
    "hysteresis.", 
    "This is, if you recall, many of you have played with", 
    "magnets and so on, and you can magnetize some of these", 
    "materials, and that's where the term is used commonly,", 
    "whereas I take a piece of metal, take some iron, and I", 
    "take a magnet and I-- so let's say, let me get some art going", 
    "here, let's have a piece of metal.", 
    "And then I take a magnet.", 
    "Let's say I take a magnet here, and", 
    "so this is my magnet.", 
    "And then I slide the magnet on the piece of iron and I'm", 
    "going to magnetize it.", 
    "So if I move it back and forth, I'm going to magnetize", 
    "that the piece of iron.", 
    "And then, even if I take away the magnet, the iron might", 
    "have some residual magnetism left in it.", 
    "Clearly the piece of iron is touching the magnet.", 
    "This will attract other objects.", 
    "But even if I take away the magnet, the piece of iron will", 
    "have some residual magnetism left behind it.", 
    "And that property which remembers what happened during", 
    "the past is called hysteresis.", 
    "So in this case, for the op amp circuit with positive", 
    "feedback, I have some hysteresis in that it", 
    "remembers what the inputs were in the past, and the output", 
    "depends on the sequence of inputs that I apply.", 
    "Now, why is this useful?", 
    "This is useful, and I'll show you an example.", 
    "Let's go back to the example I've shown you earlier where I", 
    "had a sinusoid which was noisy.", 
    "Some input, it doesn't turn out to be a sinusoid, some", 
    "input which was noisy.", 
    "So this is noise superimposed on the signal.", 
    "And let's see how a circuit like this would behave. So", 
    "let's say up here is 15 volts and down", 
    "here is minus 15 volts.", 
    "So this is 7.5 volts, and down here is minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "So if I apply this as input to my operational", 
    "amplifier, what do I get?", 
    "So the op amp circuit that I have is this--", 
    "minus, plus--", 
    "this is my op amp circuit and this is vo.", 
    "If I apply vi to this op amp circuit with positive", 
    "feedback, what do I get?", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "When my input is positive, let's say my output is going", 
    "to be at minus 15 volts.", 
    "I want to start my life out here.", 
    "So I'm in this state.", 
    "So I start off in this state.", 
    "So this is one, this is one, I'm", 
    "starting off in this state.", 
    "So vo is at minus 15 volts.", 
    "So notice that nothing can happen until the vi becomes", 
    "less than minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "So let's mark this down like this.", 
    "So eventually vi gets to be less than minus 7.5 volts, so", 
    "at this point, what happens?", 
    "At this point, I'm going to switch to a positive state.", 
    "So two is this instant where vi becomes less than minus 7.5", 
    "volts, and so here is where I switch to plus 15 volts, and", 
    "this is what I have. So notice that once I switch to the plus", 
    "15 state, no change is going to happen until vi becomes", 
    "greater than 7.5 volts.", 
    "So here, I could care less that even if the input were", 
    "crossing like--", 
    "this is not good, let me not get non-causal here--", 
    "so even if the input were to crisscross 7.5, no big deal.", 
    "Once I switch to plus 15, nothing is going to happen", 
    "until vi becomes greater than 7.5 volts.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So until vi becomes greater than 7.5", 
    "volts, nothing happens.", 
    "Nothing happens until vi becomes greater than 7.5", 
    "volts, and so my output would stay like this.", 
    "So notice that despite the fact that I had", 
    "criss-crossings here and criss-crossings at the 7.5, I", 
    "get a clean wave form at the output because", 
    "of the memory property.", 
    "I'm going to show you a little demonstration that will", 
    "highlight this fact.", 
    "And circuits like this are useful in building analog to", 
    "digital converters.", 
    "All right, let's move on to a demonstration and", 
    "see some fun stuff.", 
    "I'm going to show you a circuit, and show you", 
    "hysteresis in action."
