    "SPEAKER: The relationship between the charge and the", 
    "voltage for a capacitor is given by q", 
    "equals Cv as shown here.", 
    "And for our ideal linear capacitor, we can also develop", 
    "the relationships between the current and the voltage", 
    "through the capacitor.", 
    "So it is very simple to do so.", 
    "And before I talk about them being linear devices, let me", 
    "go ahead and develop their current and voltage", 
    "relationships, and then get back to it.", 
    "So we know that the current is simply given by the rate of", 
    "change of charge.", 
    "So dq by dt.", 
    "So we know that q equals Cv. So I can substitute for q in", 
    "here as Cv. So I substitute for q in here as Cv. So", 
    "it's d Cv by dt.", 
    "So d by dt of Cv.", 
    "So now, what I'm going to do next is make a 6.002x", 
    "assumption.", 
    "So in all of 6.002x, in situations like this, I'm", 
    "going to assume that my capacitor is linear", 
    "time-invariant.", 
    "That is its capacitance is not a function of time and it is a", 
    "fixed value, it is not a function of voltage.", 
    "And so I'm going to say C is given by- rather, i is given", 
    "by C dv dt.", 
    "In general, I can have very complicated capacitors.", 
    "But in 6.002x, we will deal with linear time-invariant", 
    "capacitors.", 
    "And unless we tell you explicitly, which I don't", 
    "think we will do ever in 6.002x, we will assume that", 
    "capacitors are linear time-invariant quantities.", 
    "And so you can always write i equals C dv dt.", 
    "So that is a relationship between the", 
    "current and the voltage.", 
    "They're related by the constant C, which is the", 
    "capacitance.", 
    "I can also express v in terms of i.", 
    "So if i is dv dt, then v must be the integral of i dt.", 
    "So v, if I move C to the other side, I get 1 divided by C", 
    "integral minus infinity to t of i dt.", 
    "So that is another important formula that", 
    "you can keep in mind.", 
    "So whether it's in terms of i in terms of v, or v in terms", 
    "of i, these are the two key relationships that you can", 
    "remember for a capacitor.", 
    "Now, capacitors are linear devices.", 
    "And although I won't go into the details here, I would like", 
    "you to verify for yourselves that capacitors satisfy both", 
    "the properties of homogeneity and superposition, which is", 
    "why they are linear devices.", 
    "I'll give you a hint as to how you might try it out by", 
    "yourselves.", 
    "If you recall, we said circuits or systems that", 
    "satisfy the properties of homogeneity and superposition", 
    "are linear by definition.", 
    "And so you can show the property of homogeneity by,", 
    "let's say if I apply v, my current is i.", 
    "Then supposing I apply a voltage alpha v, some alpha", 
    "times v, then you should notice that the current will", 
    "be alpha times the current you would get had you applied just", 
    "v. OK, where alpha is a constant.", 
    "So that is the homogeneity property.", 
    "And then, you can also do the superposition property where", 
    "if you replace v with a sum of two voltages, v1 plus v2, you", 
    "can convince yourselves that i will be the sum of the", 
    "responses to the two voltage v1 and v2 independently.", 
    "And so therefore, you get these being linear devices.", 
    "And the key reason is that differentiation and", 
    "integration are linear operations.", 
    "They don't cause any nonlinearity to happen and", 
    "they are linear operations.", 
    "So therefore, if I have d by dt of v1 plus v2,", 
    "fundamentally it becomes dv1 by dt plus dv2 by dt.", 
    "And similarly, d by dt of alpha v simply", 
    "becomes alpha dv dt.", 
    "So this is how you can show that", 
    "capacitors are linear devices.", 
    "OK, continuing with the properties of capacitors.", 
    "So I've summarized these two constituent", 
    "relationships for you.", 
    "So in terms of charge, q is Cv. And in terms of i, it's i", 
    "equals C dv dt.", 
    "We can also compute the power for the capacitor.", 
    "So you recall the power is given by the voltage times the", 
    "current into an element.", 
    "So power is vi.", 
    "And so I can write vi, I write v as it is, and i is", 
    "C dv dt from here.", 
    "So I write C dv by dt.", 
    "And so again, what I can do is, if I put the d by dt", 
    "around this whole expression, so this in turn is equivalent", 
    "to half C v squared.", 
    "OK, d by dt of that.", 
    "So notice that d by dt of this whole thing, I get 2.", 
    "2 out here.", 
    "So 2 and 2 cancel out.", 
    "So I get vc dv dt, which is exactly this.", 
    "So power is d by dt of this.", 
    "So therefore, what I set up to do was figure", 
    "out the energy here.", 
    "And the energy stored in the capacitor for a capacitance C", 
    "and voltage v is given by C equals 1/2 Cv squared.", 
    "This is an extremely important relation.", 
    "This says that if I have a capacitor of capacitance C,", 
    "and if I apply a voltage v across the capacitor, they'd", 
    "store some charge.", 
    "It stores some energy and that energy for a capacitor with", 
    "capacitance C and voltage v across it is", 
    "given by 1/2 Cv squared.", 
    "So this is a very, very interesting property.", 
    "So my capacitor is a energy storage device, and it stores", 
    "energy given by 1/2 Cv squared.", 
    "So at any given point in time, I can pump energy and it will", 
    "sit there and store this energy inside it.", 
    "Now, this also makes it a memory device.", 
    "It sits and stores energy.", 
    "And that energy that is stores remembers what", 
    "had happened before.", 
    "So the capacitor stores some state.", 
    "It remembers what it stored.", 
    "And that makes it a memory device.", 
    "So therefore, in circuits with capacitors, history matters.", 
    "And the reason is that they sit around", 
    "storing this charge.", 
    "And by storing this charge, storing this energy in the", 
    "capacitor, this half CV squared quantity, by storing", 
    "this energy, it can remember what happened in the past. It", 
    "stores some energy.", 
    "And by storing this stuff, it becomes a memory device.", 
    "This makes it extremely, extremely interesting.", 
    "I really want to spend some more time on energy.", 
    "Energy is a big, big, big deal.", 
    "With capacitors, they can store energy.", 
    "And they're becoming extraordinarily useful in the", 
    "modern day world.", 
    "What people are looking to do is, for", 
    "example, use solar energy.", 
    "But you can get solar energy in the daytime.", 
    "So what do you do at nights?", 
    "So what many companies are looking to do is have this", 
    "huge solar panel fields where they harvest", 
    "energy during the daytime.", 
    "But then how do you use energy at night?", 
    "Well, what you can do is you can build these capacitors", 
    "that can store energy in capacitors.", 
    "And then you can use the energy at night.", 
    "So the capacitors remember what they've stored in the", 
    "daytime, and they can supply the energy at night.", 
    "And the beauty is notice that energy relates to v squared.", 
    "So by putting some voltage v on the capacitor, I can store", 
    "energy related to v squared.", 
    "There's also a new field in electrical engineering that", 
    "are creating whole new kinds of capacitors.", 
    "One kind of capacitor is called an ultra capacitor.", 
    "So these kind of capacitors are able to store extremely", 
    "high, extremely, extremely high voltages across them", 
    "without the dielectric breaking down.", 
    "There's a lot of interesting stuff happening with", 
    "capacitors related to energy.", 
    "Now we will also see later that it is all not good stuff.", 
    "This concept of being able to store energy and this memory", 
    "property, of course, it's good.", 
    "But it can also be harmful as we will see later.", 
    "Now, of course, it's good because I can store energy and", 
    "use it when I want.", 
    "The other reason it's good is that I can store energy and", 
    "then carry it around if I want to.", 
    "So I can use it in different places.", 
    "I can use energy in different places.", 
    "And I can also do more with it.", 
    "What I can also do is given a bunch of energy in the", 
    "capacitor, I can also create storage devices.", 
    "So you recall all the music that you play and all the film", 
    "that you store and so on.", 
    "Well, one way of doing a lot of the stuff is by storing", 
    "things into this little capacitive area.", 
    "Whether the capacitor is that of the MOSFET capacitor or", 
    "some other capacitances, I can actually store values.", 
    "And this forms the foundations of memory devices.", 
    "So if you go to your local store, electronics store and", 
    "you buy a laptop, you look for how much DRAM it has, how much", 
    "memory it has.", 
    "And it's not unusual to buy laptops today with the 1", 
    "gigabyte or more of DRAM.", 
    "So all of these things are energy.", 
    "These contain a whole bunch of little capacitors formed using", 
    "MOSFETs or other means, and they can store values.", 
    "So we will look at more of this memory property and how", 
    "we can build arrays of memory devices, such as DRAMs and", 
    "other memory systems in a later sequence.", 
    "OK, so for now I'd like to show you a little", 
    "demonstration.", 
    "So in the demonstration, you will see for yourself that I'm", 
    "going to build a little capacitor.", 
    "And I'm going to store a bunch of charge in the capacitor.", 
    "I'm going to show you that such a capacity can hold", 
    "charge for a long period of time.", 
    "And heck, let's go and have some fun.", 
    "Let's do some fun stuff."
