    "INSTRUCTOR: Based on the\nprevious method or the", 
    "previous property that you saw\nfor linear circuits, we are", 
    "now ready to define the\nsuperposition method for", 
    "circuit analysis.", 
    "Note that the superposition\nmethod", 
    "applies to linear circuits.", 
    "And again, to refresh your\nmemory, remember, we are in", 
    "the EECS playground that we got\ninto by adhering to the", 
    "lumped matter discipline.", 
    "And within that, we looked at\nthe node method and the KVL", 
    "KCL method that applies all\nover the EECS playground.", 
    "And then what we&#39;ll now do is\nlook at some methods that will", 
    "apply to only a region of this\nplayground where linear", 
    "circuits reside.", 
    "So the first of these methods\nis the superposition method.", 
    "And again, it applies\nto linear circuits.", 
    "So the method is very simple\nand inspired by the", 
    "superposition property that we\nstudied for linear circuits.", 
    "So the method simply\nsays this.", 
    "You first find the responses of\nthe circuit to each source", 
    "acting alone.", 
    "Think of this as a divide and\nconquer method where you take", 
    "your entire circuit, and you\nfind the responses of the", 
    "circuit to each source\nacting alone.", 
    "You turn off all the sources,\nand you find the response to", 
    "each source acting alone.", 
    "Then what you do is simply sum\nthose individual responses.", 
    "Note that this technique\napplies to", 
    "independent sources only.", 
    "So if I have a linear circuit,\nthen this technique applies to", 
    "independent sources only.", 
    "Now we will look at what\nhappens when you have", 
    "dependent sources and so\non in later lectures.", 
    "OK, let&#39;s move ahead.", 
    "The first step was find the\nresponse of the circuit to", 
    "each source acting alone.", 
    "But what does it mean for each\nsource to act alone?", 
    "What it means is that you turn\noff all the other sources.", 
    "So for example, suppose\nwe are focused on a", 
    "voltage source here.", 
    "What does it mean to turn\noff this voltage source?", 
    "In other words, if I want to\nset this voltage to 0, what", 
    "does it mean in terms\nof my circuit?", 
    "So in terms of my circuit, what\nthis means is that I am", 
    "going to short the source.", 
    "So what you do is you short\nthe source, and you end up", 
    "with a short circuit here.", 
    "And that is my voltage source\nhaving been set to 0.", 
    "And so I take all my voltage\nsources in the circuit and", 
    "simply short them out.", 
    "And this would be making each\nof the sources to act alone.", 
    "OK, next let&#39;s look at a current\nsource and see what it", 
    "means to set a current\nsource to 0.", 
    "So in this case, what you do is\nmuch as you set a voltage", 
    "source to 0 by shorting it\nout, you set the current", 
    "source to 0 by open-circuiting\nit like so.", 
    "So you create an open circuit\nin place of the current", 
    "source, and that&#39;s what\nit means to set a", 
    "current source to zero.", 
    "OK, so now we are ready to go\ntry out an example using the", 
    "method of superposition.", 
    "And again, remember the method\nof superposition has", 
    "two parts to it.", 
    "In the first part, you find the\nresponses of the circuit", 
    "to each source acting alone.", 
    "And then second, you sum up\nthe partial responses.", 
    "So let&#39;s go back to our\nold faithful example.", 
    "In this example, we have two\nsources, a voltage source and", 
    "a current source.", 
    "And let&#39;s say our goal is to\nfind the node voltage e taken", 
    "with respect to this ground.", 
    "And we are going to use\nthe superposition", 
    "method to do the circuit.", 
    "So I showed the circuit on the\nright-hand corner here.", 
    "And notice that e is the\nnode voltage that I", 
    "need to figure out.", 
    "So by the superposition method,\nI have two steps.", 
    "My first step is find the\nresponses of the circuit to", 
    "each source acting alone.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is let\nme start with finding the", 
    "response of the circuit to the\nvoltage source acting alone.", 
    "So what do I do to get a\nsubcircuit in which the", 
    "voltage source is\nacting alone?", 
    "So I want you to think about\nthis and try to figure out", 
    "what the resulting subcircuit\nis going to look like.", 
    "I&#39;ll give you a few seconds to\ndo that before I do it myself.",
