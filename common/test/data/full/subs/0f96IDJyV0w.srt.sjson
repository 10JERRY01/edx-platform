    "This is one of the really,\nreally fun", 
    "parts of the course.", 
    "And here you will see that\nthere is a really close", 
    "connection between the analog\nworld and the digital world.", 
    "In fact, as we go down into this\ntopic in more detail, we", 
    "will see that the same kinds\nof techniques that you&#39;ve", 
    "developed in your tool chest so\nfar will apply in certain", 
    "parts of the digital\nworld as well.", 
    "As is my usual practice, let me\nstart with a really quick", 
    "review of what we&#39;ve\ndone so far.", 
    "So we started by discretizing\nmatter or lumping matter and", 
    "by observing the lumped\nmatter discipline.", 
    "By doing so, we took matter\nand discretized it and, in", 
    "doing so, created a lumped\ncircuit abstraction.", 
    "We had lumped elements like\nresisters and voltage sources", 
    "and current sources.", 
    "Following that, we created our\nanalysis tool chest. So as", 
    "part of this tool chest, we\ncreated several techniques", 
    "such as the KVL/KCL method.", 
    "We created the composition\nmethod where you took", 
    "resistors and sources\nand combined them.", 
    "We created the node method.", 
    "And for circuits that were\nlinear, we applied and created", 
    "a set of methods called\nsuperposition method, the", 
    "Thevenin method and\nthe Norton method.", 
    "Now notice that the first three\nmethods, the KVL/KCL,", 
    "composition and node, apply\nto all circuits.", 
    "However, the superposition,\nThevenin and Norton methods", 
    "apply only to linear circuits.", 
    "I also want to point out that\nthe node method, that is our", 
    "key method, we will use\nit all over the place.", 
    "And so you should think\nof that as the", 
    "chainsaw of our business.", 
    "It can cut absolutely\nanything.", 
    "There you go.",
