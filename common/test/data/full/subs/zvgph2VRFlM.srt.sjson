    "SPEAKER: Now I'm going to show you some really,", 
    "really fun stuff, OK?", 
    "This is going to be truly, truly exciting.", 
    "I'm going to show you a way in which you can plot the", 
    "waveforms for these second order circuits completely by", 
    "intuition, no differential equations, no math.", 
    "Look at a circuit, look at some values, and sketch out", 
    "the waveform in seconds.", 
    "So suppose that given a circuit, a series r of c", 
    "circuit like shown here, and I'm also giving you a couple", 
    "more things.", 
    "I'm giving you the initial voltage on the capacitor.", 
    "I'm giving you values for the two state variables.", 
    "So I'm telling you that the initial voltage on the", 
    "capacitor is some positive value at time t equals 0.", 
    "And let's say I also tell you that the current, the initial", 
    "value of the current through the series circuit is some", 
    "negative value.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So the reference direction for the current is taken in this", 
    "direction, towards the right.", 
    "And if I tell you i of 0 is negative, that means that the", 
    "actual current is flowing in the direction opposite to the", 
    "reference direction I have chosen.", 
    "In other words, the real current is", 
    "flowing to the left.", 
    "So I'm giving you these two values for i of 0 and v of 0,", 
    "and I'm also telling you that vi is some DC value after time", 
    "t equals 0.", 
    "So for example, it might be a step that looks like this--", 
    "v of t, v of t.", 
    "OK, so after t equals 0, the value is going to be", 
    "some DC value, VI.", 
    "So how do you go about sketching the waveform for--", 
    "let me draw a couple of axes here, a pair of axes, time", 
    "equals 0 and v of t.", 
    "All right, how do we go about doing something like this?", 
    "Well, in the last video I mentioned that the", 
    "characteristic equation for these circuits are able to", 
    "virtually completely characterize the behavior of", 
    "the circuit, of course, in addition to the initial", 
    "conditions and the input waveform.", 
    "So based on the characteristic equation for the circuit, we", 
    "know some key parameters.", 
    "We know that alpha is R divided by 2L.", 
    "OK, I know R, I know L, so I know alpha is R divided by 2L.", 
    "I know omega 0 is 1 divided by square root of LC.", 
    "OK, these are all key parameters that I know from", 
    "the characteristic equation.", 
    "I know omega d, the damped natural frequency, is given by", 
    "square root of omega 0 squared minus alpha squared.", 
    "I also know the quality factor Q, the quality factor is omega", 
    "0 by 2 alpha.", 
    "OK, so I know a bunch of these things right away by looking", 
    "at the circuit.", 
    "And it turns out that pretty much that is really all I need", 
    "to know to figure out what the waveform looks like.", 
    "All right, let's start with this.", 
    "So since I'm plotting v, I know that initial", 
    "value for v is v0.", 
    "OK, so let's say it's [UNINTELLIGIBLE] here.", 
    "OK, so I know that this is v0.", 
    "OK, so I found one point.", 
    "You are commonly asked to sketch the waveform or figure", 
    "out what the waveform looks like for various circuits, and", 
    "so I found one point.", 
    "The next thing that's useful to do is to find out what the", 
    "value is after a long period of time.", 
    "OK, and in this case, after the circuit comes to rest, I", 
    "have a resistor so it dissipates a whole bunch of", 
    "energy, and so the initial conditions on the capacitor", 
    "and the inductor will--", 
    "the capacitor and the inductor start off at the initial", 
    "conditions in terms of voltage and current, respectively.", 
    "And then over time, things settle down to their steady", 
    "state values.", 
    "So for the inductor, it begins to look like a long term", 
    "charge circuit and the capacitor would look like a", 
    "long term open circuit.", 
    "So if the voltage across the voltage source is vi, then", 
    "after a long period of time, vi will appear across the", 
    "capacitor, again no more current for", 
    "the flow to the circuit.", 
    "So let's say that value is here.", 
    "So the long term value is vi.", 
    "So I know that after a long period of time, the value of", 
    "the voltage across the capacitor is going to be VI.", 
    "OK, I marked two spots.", 
    "OK, I know the time period of oscillations.", 
    "So the period of oscillation is going to be", 
    "2 pi by omega d.", 
    "OK, so I know that.", 
    "Q tells me--", 
    "the quality factor tells me that the number of rings of", 
    "the circuit, OK, the number of cycles over which ringing", 
    "takes place is omega 0 by 2 alpha.", 
    "So here's what I know so far.", 
    "So my waveform here is going to be sinusoidal.", 
    "It's a series RLC circuit.", 
    "And by the way, I can very quickly check the value of", 
    "alpha and omega 0.", 
    "So let's say that alpha is less than omega 0, and this", 
    "situation is an underdamped case.", 
    "And the moment I know alpha and omega 0, I can figure out", 
    "whether it's overdamped or underdamped", 
    "or critically damped.", 
    "OK, let's say it's underdamped.", 
    "So I know that the circuit is going to be ringing for", 
    "awhile, and I know that, if I know Q, I know that it will", 
    "ring for Q cycles.", 
    "OK, so right there I'm pretty much done.", 
    "So I have two options for how this might look.", 
    "OK, I'm going to start at Q v0, and it could be that my", 
    "waveform might look like this, or it could be that my", 
    "waveform might look like this.", 
    "It might look like this.", 
    "It's not clear whether I'm going to be going up or I'm", 
    "going to be going down to start.", 
    "So it could be going up like this, or it could be", 
    "something like this.", 
    "Based on what I know so far, it's not clear to me whether", 
    "it's going to be here or it's going to start like this.", 
    "OK, we'll talk about that in a second.", 
    "I also do know, given that I know alpha, I know that the", 
    "decay is going to be governed e raised to the minus alpha t.", 
    "OK, and I know alpha, so I know what that is", 
    "going to look like.", 
    "So the final thing that I'm left with is, is it going to", 
    "be heading up right here or is it going to be going down?", 
    "Is it going to be going up or is it going to be going down?", 
    "What do you think?", 
    "OK, let me give you a hint.", 
    "To figure out whether it's going up or going down, we'll", 
    "need to be looking at the initial current.", 
    "So I'm given that i of 0 is negative.", 
    "OK, this means that at time t equal to 0, the current is in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "So i of 0 is in this direction, which means that", 
    "the capacitor must be discharging because the", 
    "current is in this direction.", 
    "OK, so instantaneously at time t equal to 0, the current is", 
    "flowing left and so the capacitor must be discharging,", 
    "so therefore, the capacitor voltage must be falling down.", 
    "OK, so given that, this is the sketch for the voltage that", 
    "seems to be the most reasonable", 
    "to use in the situation.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "And this period here is 2 pi by omega d.", 
    "I have Q rings, OK?", 
    "And the oscillation frequency, the damped natural frequency", 
    "is omega d, and the time period, as I said earlier, is", 
    "2 pi divided by omega d.", 
    "OK, so there's Q rings, and after the Q rings, my voltage,", 
    "or the capacitor vi, will settle down at VI, where that", 
    "is the voltage at the voltage of the input source.", 
    "So notice here, no differential equations, OK?", 
    "I just looked at the initial conditions, the input value,", 
    "and alpha omega 0, omega d and Q, and I sketched out the", 
    "waveform for you without using any math,", 
    "completely through intuition.", 
    "And in most cases in circuits, this is what", 
    "you're going to be doing.", 
    "Very, very rarely are we going to be asking you to solve", 
    "differential equations.", 
    "Worst comes to the worst, we may ask you to develop the", 
    "differential equation for a circuit, substitute ae raised", 
    "to st into it, and then write the characteristic equation.", 
    "That's about as far as you'll ever have to go in terms of", 
    "math to solve these second order circuits."
