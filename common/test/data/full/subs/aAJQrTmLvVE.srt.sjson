    "SPEAKER 1: So in the sequence you saw this concept of nodal", 
    "analysis where what we did is if we have a circuit and we", 
    "want to figure out all of the voltages and currents of the", 
    "circuit for every independent node of the circuit.", 
    "So in this case, b and b.", 
    "We write down the Kirchoff's current", 
    "level for the equations.", 
    "So for b, we write down all the currents going into b.", 
    "For d, we write down all the currents going into d.", 
    "We saw solve that set of equations and we get back the", 
    "node potentials.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And from those node potentials, we can deduce the", 
    "branch voltages, b minus t for example, is the", 
    "voltage across R3.", 
    "And that gives us an ability to tell the current.", 
    "So we get all the currents as well as the voltages.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Now the problem with this technique is that", 
    "it's a little bit hairy.", 
    "It involves writing a lot of algebra.", 
    "And so we saw a couple of simplifications.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: One particularly import one is the idea of", 
    "terminal equivalents.", 
    "If we have, for example, a circuit consisting of two", 
    "resistors connected up like that in series, then from the", 
    "point of view of an exposed set of terminals, as you see", 
    "over here, we can make it a simple circuit, which has only", 
    "one resistor in it, which is exactly the same behavior from", 
    "the point of view of those terminals", 
    "as the first circuit.", 
    "So that you cannot distinguish from the external experiment", 
    "based on only the voltages and currents", 
    "of these two circuits.", 
    "That's called a terminal equivalence.", 
    "And of course, we saw that can be done in terms of, for", 
    "example, not just series resistors, but also, for", 
    "example, parallel resistors can be replaced by also a", 
    "terminal equivalent resistor, which we could put", 
    "right on top of it.", 
    "And that's how you could think of it as a replacement.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And in the next lecture, we'll see a couple of", 
    "similar simplifications, but not so sophisticated.", 
    "We will see this concept called Norton and Thevenin", 
    "where if we take an arbitrary network that consists of", 
    "independent voltage sources, independent current sources,", 
    "as well as linear elements.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Linear, we'll have to talk", 
    "about that in a second.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Then we can replace that with a network that", 
    "consists of one voltage source and one linear element.", 
    "Or alternatively, one current source and one linear element", 
    "only in parallel instead of in series.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And indeed, this circuit has exactly the same", 
    "terminal behavior as this one in the sense that if I were to", 
    "draw a box around this big one and I could draw a box around", 
    "this little one, there would be no way I should be able to", 
    "distinguish these two from the point of view of the voltages", 
    "and currents at their terminals.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So we use this concept of linearity.", 
    "And at this point, I think we should explain that.", 
    "The idea behind linearity is that if you apply twice as", 
    "much of some input, it will give you twice as", 
    "much of some output.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: In particular, what a linear system is, is one", 
    "that doesn't know anything about its scale.", 
    "So that in fact if you, for example as I just said,", 
    "multiply an input by a number, the output will multiply by", 
    "the same number.", 
    "That's a very important idea.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So you have seen one type of linear element,", 
    "that's a resistor.", 
    "And the reason that it's linear is it has this property", 
    "V equals IR, where if you apply twice as much voltage,", 
    "you get out twice as much current.", 
    "So if we draw on a V-I plot, it's a straight line that", 
    "passes through the origin.", 
    "And as you double the voltage, the current doubles.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Right, but if in fact you had something that", 
    "was more complicated, for example, you could have", 
    "something like this.", 
    "That's a nonlinear element.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And you have all sorts of", 
    "other nonlinear elements.", 
    "So anything that doesn't pass through the origin, anything", 
    "that curves in any way.", 
    "But the reason why it's a very powerful concept even though", 
    "almost everything is linear--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Almost everything is nonlinear.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: I'm sorry, almost everything is nonlinear.", 
    "Is because if you look closely enough at almost anything, it", 
    "starts to look like a straight line.", 
    "And although it has an offset, there are things that let us", 
    "treat this as if it were a linear system and you'll see", 
    "these much later the course.", 
    "But this is a powerful concept that comes up time and time", 
    "again in engineering, whether you're building a circuit, or", 
    "an airplane, or a car.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Or anything you'd like, in fact, because really", 
    "what we're doing is dealing with derivatives."
