    "SPEAKER 1: In this sequence,\nwe will cover nonlinear", 
    "circuits and their analysis.", 
    "We will look at four methods\nto analyze these circuits.", 
    "First, we&#39;ll look at what we\ncall the analytical method.", 
    "Then, we&#39;ll look at the\ngraphical method.", 
    "And following that,\nwe&#39;ll look at the", 
    "piecewise linear method.", 
    "And then, we will look at\nsomething we call the", 
    "incremental method, which\nis also called the", 
    "small signal method.", 
    "Now notice that in the\nanalytical method, this method", 
    "will need to be based on either\nmethod one, two, and", 
    "three of circuit analysis.", 
    "And the reason is that method\none, method two, or method", 
    "three of circuit analysis can\nbe used for circuit set", 
    "contained linear or nonlinear\nelements.", 
    "You cannot use method four\nand method five.", 
    "And the reason is that those\ntwo methods were for linear", 
    "circuits only.", 
    "Also, I will introduce the\npiecewise linear method, but", 
    "this is not going to be focused\non in this course.", 
    "And I will refer you to an\nappropriate section in the", 
    "textbook if you wish to get more\ndetails on that method.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Let&#39;s get started.", 
    "So nonlinear elements.", 
    "When these are present\nin circuits, we", 
    "get a nonlinear circuit.", 
    "So let me start by showing you\na very simple nonlinear", 
    "two-terminal element.", 
    "OK, so as before, I have a\nlittle element here, say, some", 
    "element S. And as usual, let\nme mark it with a VS and a", 
    "current going through it, iS.", 
    "OK, so these are our usual\nelement variables, VS and iS.", 
    "So let us say that for this\nelement, iS is some function", 
    "VS squared, where\na is a constant.", 
    "And let us say this is true\nfor VS is greater than or", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "And then, let us say that\nthis is equal to 0 for", 
    "VS less than 0.", 
    "So I can plot this equation out\nfor this nonlinear element", 
    "as follows.", 
    "So I plot a couple of axes.", 
    "That&#39;s a zero point.", 
    "So this is x-axis, and\nthis is the y-axis.", 
    "And so notice that iS is\n0 for VS less than 0.", 
    "So I get iS to be 0 for\nVS less than 0.", 
    "But then, iS is equal to\na times VS squared,", 
    "where a some constant.", 
    "And so there, I get a curve that\nrelates to aVS squared.", 
    "OK, so this is an example of\na nonlinear element that", 
    "reflects a square law device.", 
    "And let me give you\na second example.", 
    "And for fun, I&#39;m going\nto give you a", 
    "hypothetical a nonlinear device.", 
    "And for kicks, I&#39;m going to\ncall it the ExpoDweeb.", 
    "This doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s\njust a fun element.", 
    "It&#39;s a rather simple\nfun element that I", 
    "will use in the course.", 
    "And it&#39;s completely\nhypothetical.", 
    "I&#39;m going to represent\nthis element like so.", 
    "I&#39;m going to call this element\nD. The voltage across the", 
    "element terminal pair is VD,\nand the current is iD.", 
    "And for this element, let&#39;s say\nthat the current iD is a", 
    "times e to the bVD.", 
    "OK, so here, I&#39;m not going to\ngive you a function that has", 
    "different ranges of values for\ndifferent values of VD.", 
    "Rather, it&#39;s just one continuous\nform, iD equals ae", 
    "to the bVD.", 
    "I can plot this one\nout as well.", 
    "And as the floor, I start\nwith my axes here.", 
    "This is my VD, and\nthis is my iD.", 
    "And so here, if I plot this\nequation, when VD is a very", 
    "negative value, my\niD is close to 0.", 
    "And then as VD increases, I get\nan exponential rise in iD.", 
    "And in this case, notice that\nwhen VD is 0, when VD is 0, iD", 
    "is equal to a.", 
    "So, in this case, this is\nthe point where iD is a.", 
    "OK, so this is a hypothetical\ndevice that I&#39;m going to call", 
    "the ExpoDweeb.", 
    "Do you see something funky about\nthis device that you", 
    "haven&#39;t seen so far?", 
    "It&#39;s a pretty funky\nlittle device.", 
    "And the reason this is strange\nis that very curiously, this", 
    "device supplies power\nwhen VD is negative.", 
    "So notice here that when VD is\npositive, when VD is positive", 
    "at this range, current\niD is positive.", 
    "OK, which means when VD, current\niD is flowing into the", 
    "positive terminal\nof the element.", 
    "And so, in that situation,\nit consumes power.", 
    "I&#39;m delivering power\ninto the element.", 
    "However, notice that when VD is", 
    "negative, iD is still positive.", 
    "So in that situation, the device\nis supplying power.", 
    "So it&#39;s a funky little device.", 
    "Next, I&#39;m going to look at some\ncircuits that I can build", 
    "using non-linear devices\nsuch as this.",
