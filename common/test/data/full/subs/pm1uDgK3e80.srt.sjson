    "SPEAKER: Let's get right down to analyzing the circuit,", 
    "which I've drawn a little more clearly for you.", 
    "I'm going to start by pointing out a few of the variables and", 
    "intermediate values, so our equations will become cleaner.", 
    "So you recall that V naught is equal to AV star.", 
    "So we know that V naught equals AV star.", 
    "And so, therefore, V star is simply V naught", 
    "divided by A, OK?", 
    "We also assumed that I'm going to have a small perturbation.", 
    "So V naught of zero is going to be K. OK, so I have a small", 
    "perturbation at my input when I start, OK?", 
    "So this is my small perturbation.", 
    "OK, left to itself, this circuit will gravitate to V", 
    "naught equals zero, assuming reasonable parameters here.", 
    "OK, assuming that there's no noise and reasonable behavior,", 
    "my V naught is expected to be at zero.", 
    "But what I'm going to do is perturb it and give it a small", 
    "bump of K volts.", 
    "And so my V naught of zero is going to be assumed to be K.", 
    "All right, a few other things that I would like to use.", 
    "So this intermediate voltage here, I would like to", 
    "calculate that as well.", 
    "So that is V plus.", 
    "V plus is equal to V naught times the", 
    "voltage divider action.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "So it's V naught.", 
    "So notice that V naught here appears at V plus through this", 
    "voltage divider action.", 
    "And the voltage divider consists of R2 and R1.", 
    "So V plus is simply V naught times R1", 
    "divided by R2 plus R1.", 
    "So I'm going to see that a lot, OK?", 
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to denote R1 divided by", 
    "R2 plus R1 as some feedback component, as some fraction.", 
    "I'm going to call that fraction gamma plus, OK?", 
    "So this is going to be gamma plus V naught.", 
    "What is gamma plus?", 
    "Gamma plus is simply the proportion of V naught that is", 
    "fed back to the positive input, OK?", 
    "So that is R1 divided by R2 plus R1, OK?", 
    "So let me just make a quick note of that down here.", 
    "Gamma plus is fraction of V naught fed back to the", 
    "positive input.", 
    "OK, so now let's work on V minus.", 
    "So V minus, that's a voltage here.", 
    "So V minus is equal to--", 
    "and this case, I have fed back through the voltage divider", 
    "resistors, R3 and R4, so V minus will be V naught times", 
    "R3 divided by R3 plus R4.", 
    "And in this case, I want to denote R3 divided by R3 plus", 
    "R4 as gamma minus for convenience, because you will", 
    "see that I will be using that a lot, OK?", 
    "So just like gamma plus, gamma minus will be fraction of V", 
    "naught fed back to a negative input.", 
    "So fraction of V naught fed back to negative input.", 
    "OK, so that's gamma plus and gamma minus.", 
    "And we're going to see those two quite a bit.", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "Do I need anything else?", 
    "Oh, yeah.", 
    "Let me do the current here.", 
    "I'll need that.", 
    "OK, the current here is simply CdV star dt because, if the", 
    "current is i, i is CdV star by dt, OK?", 
    "So I will need that too, because the current going", 
    "through the capacitor is CdV star dt.", 
    "OK, so now I am ready to do my analysis, now that I have some", 
    "of these intermediate values all computed and ready to go.", 
    "OK, so let me start with applying the node equation.", 
    "By the way, I'll just solve it from first principles.", 
    "But it should be pretty straightforward that we have a", 
    "voltage source here, the dependent voltage source.", 
    "We have a resistance and a capacitance.", 
    "And you should be able to write down the dynamics of V", 
    "star and the dynamics of V naught pretty much by", 
    "observation.", 
    "But you recall, for an RC circuit, we could write down", 
    "through intuition what V star looked like.", 
    "OK, we applied intuition and directly wrote that down", 
    "previously, so you could do that.", 
    "But just for kicks, I am going to do this pretty much from", 
    "first principles, so we can get a clear understanding of", 
    "how this works.", 
    "OK, so let me start with the node equation, OK?", 
    "So I'll use node method.", 
    "For the node whose voltage I do not know, and that is here,", 
    "that's the node with voltage V star, OK?", 
    "So the node with voltage--", 
    "we make it look like a star--", 
    "V star.", 
    "OK, so let me add up the currents leaving the node.", 
    "The current going down from the node through the capacitor", 
    "is CdV star dt.", 
    "OK, that's a current going down through the node.", 
    "And then add up the current going to the left of the node,", 
    "and the two should sum to zero.", 
    "The current going through the left is simply V star minus", 
    "the voltage to the left of the resistor, which is V plus", 
    "minus V minus.", 
    "And that divided by R, and according to the node method,", 
    "that should be equal to zero.", 
    "OK, so notice that the voltage at this node here is V plus", 
    "minus V minus, so this is V plus minus V minus.", 
    "And so the current headed left is V star minus the difference", 
    "between V plus and V minus divided by R. And that is", 
    "equal to zero.", 
    "And notice that we also know that V star is equal to V", 
    "naught divided by A. OK, so let me go ahead and start", 
    "simplifying things.", 
    "Let me go and do two things.", 
    "First of all, let me replace V star with V naught divided by", 
    "A. And let me also multiply out by R. So let's do that.", 
    "Multiplying out by R and replacing V star with V naught", 
    "divided by A, what do I get?", 
    "So I get RC dV naught by dt divided by A, OK?", 
    "So I have replaced V star with V naught divided by A.", 
    "And then here, what do I get?", 
    "I get V naught divided by A minus V plus minus V minus.", 
    "And I multiply it out by R. So I don't have an R out there,", 
    "so that is equal to zero.", 
    "OK, so that's what I have.", 
    "I also know that V plus from here is gamma plus V naught.", 
    "And V minus is gamma minus V naught, OK?", 
    "So I know that V plus is gamma plus V naught.", 
    "And V minus is gamma minus V naught.", 
    "And so I can simply write that as gamma plus minus gamma", 
    "minus V naught, OK?", 
    "So there I have my differential equation in V", 
    "naught, RC divided by A dv naught by dt plus V naught", 
    "divided by A is equal to gamma plus minus gamma minus times V", 
    "naught, OK?", 
    "So this is my differential equation.", 
    "So in the next few minutes, let me go ahead and", 
    "solve that for you."
