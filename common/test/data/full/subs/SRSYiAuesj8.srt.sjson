    "SPEAKER 1: So before we wrap up\non the SR and S models for", 
    "the MOSFET and switches, and\nbuilding digital circuits", 
    "using these switches and\nMOSFETs, I would like to make", 
    "some observations.", 
    "Hopefully, these will convey\nsome very interesting", 
    "insights, particularly those\nthat relate to the connection", 
    "between the analog world\nand the digital world.", 
    "So first of all, notice that the\nswitches that we&#39;ve been", 
    "dealing with so far\nare non-linear.", 
    "When you build a circuit\ncontaining a switch, even the", 
    "very simple inverter that looked\nlike this, VN versus", 
    "VR, notice that the transfer\ncurve that you", 
    "got looked like this.", 
    "So this is clearly non-linear.", 
    "This is not a straight line.", 
    "It is piecewise linear.", 
    "In other words, it&#39;s\nlinear in pieces.", 
    "But it is not a linear curve.", 
    "This is non-linear.", 
    "So when you build circuits using\nswitches and MOSFETs and", 
    "so on, you end with non-linear\nbehavior, and these are not", 
    "non-linear devices.", 
    "However, one of the interesting\nfacts is, notice", 
    "that for a given setting\nof the switches--", 
    "so say for example, I pick a\ngiven set of values for A&#39;s,", 
    "B&#39;s, and C&#39;s.", 
    "Let&#39;s say I pick A equal to 1,\nB equal to 1, and I pick C", 
    "equal to 0, notice that what I\nget here is a set of switch", 
    "values that look like this.", 
    "For just above the switch,\nI get the on-state", 
    "resistance, B is 1.", 
    "So I get Ron here.", 
    "And this is 0, so I get an\nopen connection up here.", 
    "OK, notice that for a given set\nof switch values, given", 
    "set control values---", 
    "A equal to 1, B equal to\n1, and C equal to 0--", 
    "notice what we&#39;re left with\nis a linear subcircuit.", 
    "This is a remarkable result.", 
    "This is really nice.", 
    "What this says is that I can\nactually use my linear", 
    "techniques, my big bazookas,\nSuperposition and Thevenin,", 
    "and so on, to analyze\nthese subcircuits.", 
    "So if I generally take a digital\ncircuit and pick a set", 
    "of values for the inputs, such\nas A&#39;s, B&#39;s, C&#39;s, and so on,", 
    "and then from that set of\nvalues, I replace the switches", 
    "with their either on states or\noff states, and the resulting", 
    "circuit is completely linear,\nand all my linear techniques", 
    "will apply.", 
    "This is a pretty nice\n[? insight. ?]", 
    "The second thing I want to talk\nabout is something that", 
    "people commonly do with\ncircuits, is look at the power", 
    "consumed by a circuit.", 
    "And power is becoming\na really, really", 
    "big deal in our field.", 
    "And in fact, the consequences\nof power are driving the way", 
    "we are building our digital\ndesigns today.", 
    "And so, one of the things we&#39;d\nlike to do is analyze the", 
    "power consumed by our\ndigital circuits.", 
    "Power is becoming extremely\nimportant in data centers and", 
    "other places, where almost a\nthird to a half of the cost of", 
    "operating a large data center,\nsuch as those you might find", 
    "with Google, or Facebook, and\nso on that maintain all of", 
    "these computers when you go\non Facebook and so on--", 
    "Facebook has these huge data\ncenters that contain millions", 
    "of computers.", 
    "They&#39;re all burning power.", 
    "And it costs a lot of money.", 
    "And so, the amount of money\ncan be extremely large.", 
    "And so, power is extremely\nimportant for that and many", 
    "other reasons.", 
    "So let&#39;s try to understand how\nto compute power for our", 
    "digital circuits.", 
    "So let&#39;s go to our example here,\nwhere I set A equal to", 
    "1, B equal to 1, and C is 0,\nand I get my subcircuit.", 
    "You should be able to directly\nwrite the power from here.", 
    "But if you really want to, you\ncan go and simplify it a", 
    "little bit just to make\nit a little cleaner.", 
    "If you want, you can do\nsomething like this.", 
    "So this is Ron.", 
    "This is Ron.", 
    "And this RL.", 
    "And I get A equals\n1, B equals 1,", 
    "controlling the two MOSFETs.", 
    "And then, since the other leg\nof the circuit is an open", 
    "circuit, I don&#39;t have\nto show it.", 
    "So what is the power consumed\nby this circuit?", 
    "And back to basics, the power\nhere is simply given by the", 
    "voltage squared divided\nby the resistance.", 
    "So here the power is given\nby V squared divided", 
    "by 2Ron plus RL.", 
    "And this is simply, not\nsurprisingly, VS", 
    "times the current i.", 
    "And if you have the current\ni flowing through", 
    "here, that is the power.", 
    "And i in turn is given by VS\ndivided by 2Ron plus RL.", 
    "And so therefore, notice that\nthis expression is the same as", 
    "this expression when you\nsubstitute for the current.", 
    "So notice here that the power,\ninterestingly enough, relates", 
    "to VS squared.", 
    "So the power relates to\nthe square of the", 
    "power supply voltage.", 
    "And this is pretty common\nin our digital circuits.", 
    "And so although for pedagogical\nreasons we", 
    "commonly use VS equals 5 volts\nin this course, because of", 
    "this huge power consumption and\nthe power issue, modern", 
    "day circuits have kept reducing\nthe voltage, VS, over", 
    "the past couple of decades.", 
    "And in fact, today, it is not\nuncommon to see a VS in the", 
    "order plus 0.7 volts\nor 0.8 volts.", 
    "We&#39;ve come down substantially.", 
    "So notice that the power when\nVS was 5 volts, was", 
    "proportional to 5 squared, which\nis on the order of VS", 
    "squared at 25.", 
    "And then when I go to VS,\nwhich is almost 1/7 of 5", 
    "volts, I manage to reduce my\npower by a factor of 49.", 
    "So this is 1/7 the power\nsupply voltage of the", 
    "[? past. ?]", 
    "And the square of that is 149.", 
    "And so therefore, by keeping\non reducing the voltage, I", 
    "manage to reduce my power by\nclose to a factor of 50.", 
    "Notice that when I reduce my\nvoltage, VS, I have to modify", 
    "my devices to also reduce VT.", 
    "So commonly if VS is 5 volts,\nour VT that we used to use", 
    "used to be about 1 volt.", 
    "But in today&#39;s day and age, when\npower has gone down to", 
    "0.7 volts, the VTs may be on\nthe order of 0.3 volts to", 
    "about 0.5 volts.", 
    "So VT is tending to become\ncloser and closer to VS in", 
    "moder day circuits.", 
    "But for most of 6002x, for\npedagogic reasons and to keep", 
    "our math simple, we will\ncommonly used to be VS equals", 
    "5 volts, and commonly used\nVT equals 1 volt, unless", 
    "specified otherwise.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So before we wrap up on this,\nI&#39;d like to show you a quick", 
    "little demo to show you that\nboth analog and digital", 
    "signals and components\nare everywhere.", 
    "You will find the gates and\ndigital circuits oftentimes", 
    "juxtaposed with analog\ncircuits.", 
    "And these are called mixed\nsignal designs because they", 
    "have both analog and\ndigital stuff.", 
    "And so stand by, and let&#39;s\nhave a little bit of fun.",
