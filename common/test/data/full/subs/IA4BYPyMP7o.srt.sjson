    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so I can go\nahead and replace my", 
    "non-linear device with a\nresistor in order to find out", 
    "the small signal behavior, and\nI can really create a circuit", 
    "in order to do this.", 
    "So what I&#39;ll do is if this\nequation is captured by the", 
    "large signal circuit, then the\nsmall signal expression can be", 
    "derived from the small\nsignal circuit.", 
    "And it is really,\nreally simple.", 
    "All I have to do is\nthe following.", 
    "I take the same circuit, and\nI replace the device, the", 
    "non-linear LED, with its\nsmall signal behavior.", 
    "OK, so here I get a resistor\nbehavior, ID, where the", 
    "resistance, R, is equal to\n1 divided by ID times b.", 
    "So for the purposes of computing\nthe small signal", 
    "behavior of the circuit, I\nreplace the device, the LED,", 
    "with a resistor as shown here.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to insert\nthe exact same circuit, the", 
    "same topology.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to replace\nthe input source here with the", 
    "small signal component,\nt input.", 
    "So here I replace the input\nwith the small signal", 
    "component, and I replace the\nLED with its small signal", 
    "equivalent, which is\nsimply a resistor.", 
    "Notice the device behaves\nlike a resistor for", 
    "small signal values.", 
    "What is absolutely amazing is\nthat if you look at the small", 
    "signal circuit, it is\na linear circuit.", 
    "My small signal circuit\nis linear.", 
    "I&#39;ve replaced the LED with the\nresistor because the LED", 
    "behaves like a resistor\nfor small signals.", 
    "And then I&#39;ve taken my source\nand replaced that with the", 
    "small signal part\nof the source.", 
    "So this is my circuit\nconstruction.", 
    "I can take the normal circuit\nand simply replace each of the", 
    "components with their small\nsignal equivalents, and I can", 
    "directly go ahead and analyze\nthe circuit in order to get", 
    "the output.", 
    "Then in this case, notice that I\ncan go ahead and analyze the", 
    "circuit very trivially.", 
    "So notice that in this case,\nid, or id, which is the", 
    "current through the device,\nwhich is the output I care", 
    "about, is simply given\nby vi divided by the", 
    "resistance, R. Done.", 
    "Trivial.", 
    "OK, where R is given by idb.", 
    "So this is the same as IDb.", 
    "The exact same thing that I&#39;ve\ngotten mathematically.", 
    "Just that here, I have derived\nit using a circuit technique.", 
    "So before I conclude this piece,\nI should go ahead and", 
    "summarize the small signal\ncircuit method, and we shall", 
    "use that extensively\nin 6.002x.", 
    "OK, the small signal circuit\nmethod has three steps.", 
    "You start by finding the\noperating point using DC bias", 
    "inputs from the large\nsignal circuit.", 
    "And this typically involves\na non-linear analysis.", 
    "Typically involves a non-linear\nanalysis.", 
    "So as a second step, what you\ndo is develop small signal", 
    "models, or linearized models,\nor incremental models.", 
    "They all mean the\nsame things, OK?", 
    "The small signal, linearized, or\nincremental models for each", 
    "of the elements in the\ncircuit around the", 
    "chosen operating point.", 
    "You chose the operating point\nin the first step, and then", 
    "you go and create linearized\nmodels", 
    "for each of the elements.", 
    "Recall, for our device, the\nmodels often depends on the", 
    "operating point values chosen.", 
    "Remember, for our LED, R\nwas given by 1 by IDb.", 
    "And notice ID was an operating\npoint value.", 
    "So in general, the large signal\nmodel for a device", 
    "might look like this.", 
    "So if I put device, and I put a\nvoltage vD across it, and I", 
    "take a current iD, and\nlet&#39;s say iD was", 
    "some function of vD.", 
    "And let&#39;s say this\nis non-linear.", 
    "Then the small signal model is\ngiven by this expression.", 
    "So here&#39;s my device.", 
    "So it says small vd, and a small\nid to reflect the small", 
    "signal current.", 
    "And I get id by linearizing\nthe device.", 
    "And the way you get that is by\ntaking the derivative of the", 
    "function, f of vd.", 
    "So you take the derivative of\nthe function, f of vd--", 
    "oops.", 
    "Let me start over here.", 
    "You take the derivative of the\nfunction, df(vD), dvD, and you", 
    "evaluate that at the point\nvD equals capital VD.", 
    "And then you multiply\nthat by small vd.", 
    "So you replace the device by\nits small signal model, and", 
    "the small signal model has the\ndevice giving you a small vd", 
    "and a small id, where the\nsmall id [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "the small vd by multiplying\nsmall vd by the slope of the", 
    "function f of vD at the point\nvD equals capital VD.", 
    "So that gives you the small\nsignal model for each device.", 
    "So as step two, you replaced\neach of the original elements", 
    "in your non-linear circuit\nwith small signal models.", 
    "And the small signal models\nare characterized by small", 
    "signal id and vd, where the id\nand vd are derived from the", 
    "non-linear device equation\naccording to this formula.", 
    "And then, as a third step, you\nsimply take your resulting", 
    "circuit, which has all the small\nsignal elemental models,", 
    "and you go to analyze it.", 
    "And the beauty is that the\nresulting linearized circuit", 
    "is linear, and you just have\nto go through a linear", 
    "analysis in order to get\nthe circuit response.", 
    "And the beauty of that is\nyou can use all kinds of", 
    "techniques, linear techniques,\nlike superposition, Thevenin,", 
    "et cetera, apply.", 
    "You can use these techniques\nthat apply for linear circuits", 
    "to these resulting circuits.", 
    "And part of the reason is that\nfor most of these elements,", 
    "what you end up with is these\nresistive elements that are", 
    "linear elements.", 
    "So virtually all of these\nnon-linear devices turn into", 
    "very simple resistive elements\nwith a linear response.", 
    "The sources will turn\ninto either open", 
    "circuits or short circuits.", 
    "So think of that as infinite\nresistors or zero resistances", 
    "and other non-linear devices\nwe&#39;re counting to be small", 
    "resistors now where you get ID\nversus VD related as shown.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So the next section, what I\nwould like to do is I would", 
    "like to spend some time\ndiscussing how we go about", 
    "deriving the small signal\nlinearized models for each of", 
    "several types of elements that\nwe have. We can derive", 
    "linearized models\nboth for linear", 
    "elements, like resistors.", 
    "We could also derive\nthem for all kinds", 
    "of non-linear elements.", 
    "And we&#39;ll go ahead and do a few\nexamples, and then in the", 
    "future you should be able to\nwrite down these non-linear", 
    "models pretty much\nby inspection.", 
    "So let&#39;s get right down to it.",
