    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "So what you see here is three sine waves.", 
    "A yellow sine wave, which is the input here.", 
    "You see a green sine wave, which is the input VC at the", 
    "gate of the MOSFET.", 
    "And then you see the blue, which is the output here.", 
    "So for now, simply focus on the yellow and the blue.", 
    "The yellow is the input, and the blue is the output.", 
    "I apply some input, and I get a output that looks more or", 
    "less some linear function of this input here.", 
    "It's a small signal.", 
    "What I'm going to do is I'm going to change the frequency", 
    "of the input.", 
    "Remember, I want to look at the response of the circuit to", 
    "a sinusoid.", 
    "So I'm feeding a sinusoid here.", 
    "Look at the response.", 
    "I'm going to change the frequency.", 
    "That's a big shift that we're making, in that the curves", 
    "that we drew in the last lecture had to do", 
    "with varying time.", 
    "Now I'm going to focus on sinusoids", 
    "and vary their frequency.", 
    "So I'm going to change the frequency, and stare at the", 
    "blue curve as I increase the frequency.", 
    "And just think about what you would expect.", 
    "Based on the knowledge you have so far, you would expect", 
    "that, look, as I change the frequency, the frequency", 
    "should change, but I should see the same amplitude.", 
    "But take a look.", 
    "Let me to increase the frequency of the input, and", 
    "what do you see at the output?", 
    "So I'm increasing the frequency.", 
    "What do you see happening there?", 
    "If we don't see anything changing there, you'll need to", 
    "see an optometrist. But, OK.", 
    "So what do we see here?", 
    "As I increase the frequency, what happened to the blue?", 
    "The blue kept decreasing in amplitude.", 
    "And you're saying, whoa!", 
    "What's happening here?", 
    "We don't have the tools to deal with this.", 
    "I expected that I change my frequency, my frequency here", 
    "should change, of course, but why is the amplitude changing?", 
    "What's happening here?", 
    "That is weird.", 
    "And notice that this amplitude became smaller because the", 
    "amplitude of the green became smaller.", 
    "And remember, the green was the", 
    "voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "So this is your RC.", 
    "And here's my input.", 
    "My input has the amplitude, which I'm holding", 
    "more or less constant.", 
    "And notice that VC has decreased in value as I", 
    "increase my frequency.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Just hold that thought.", 
    "So as I increase the frequency of my input, the amplitude of", 
    "the output kept diminishing.", 
    "In other words, the gain of the system seems to have", 
    "decreased as I increase my frequency.", 
    "And today, we'll look at why that is so and how we can", 
    "analyze that.", 
    "The other thing that is not so obvious here is there's a", 
    "phase shift.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is, try to see if you can observe", 
    "the phase shift here.", 
    "Notice here.", 
    "What we have been used to is for the amplifier, we get a", 
    "complete inversion at the output.", 
    "Inversion means a phase difference of 180 degrees for", 
    "a sine wave, right?", 
    "So this peak should have been here.", 
    "But notice that there's a shifting of the peak.", 
    "In other words, if the yellow was my input, my output should", 
    "have had its minimum when the input had its maximum.", 
    "But notice there's a shifting of the signal such that the", 
    "output is a maximum.", 
    "Not quite at the point where the input is a minimum, but a", 
    "little bit after that.", 
    "Also weird.", 
    "So not only has this little circuit here lost its gain", 
    "somehow, but also it seems to have shifted", 
    "the signal in phase.", 
    "That is weird.", 
    "And today, we'll look at why that is so and try to", 
    "understand the frequency behavior of this little", 
    "sub-component here.", 
    "Notice that VC is exactly 180 out of phase with VO.", 
    "So VO is faithfully an inverted, amplified form of", 
    "the input VC.", 
    "However, VC itself should have been the same as VI, but it", 
    "looks quite different.", 
    "So let's understand why that is so."
