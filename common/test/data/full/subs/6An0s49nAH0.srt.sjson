    "SPEAKER 1: All right.", 
    "As I've been saying all along for these second order RLC", 
    "circuits, all you have to do is find the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "And once you find the characteristic equation, you", 
    "can very quickly find out alpha and omega naught from", 
    "it, and then find the damped natural frequency and then Q.", 
    "And once you have these parameters, you know by", 
    "looking at alpha and omega naught, you can figure out", 
    "whether it's critically damped, underdamped or", 
    "overdamped.", 
    "And then you can very quickly sketch out the wave form for", 
    "that circuit.", 
    "So as a final example, let me do a parallel RLC circuit.", 
    "And, as I said before, the characteristic", 
    "equation says it all.", 
    "So I would like to develop the characteristic equation for a", 
    "parallel RLC circuit, and what you have to do is, at least", 
    "based on what you know so far, all you have to do is develop", 
    "the differential equation that characterizes the behavior of", 
    "the parallel RLC circuit.", 
    "And then you can very quickly get the characteristic", 
    "equation from there by trying out the first couple of steps", 
    "of solving the homogeneous equation.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's go ahead and do this, and show you how you can very", 
    "quickly get the characteristic equation.", 
    "Later on in this course, a couple of sequences later, I'm", 
    "going to show you an extraordinarily simple way of", 
    "writing the characteristic equation that does not even", 
    "involve writing the differential equation.", 
    "But for now, let's write the differential equation for the", 
    "following circuit.", 
    "So I have a parallel RLC circuit.", 
    "In this case I'm going to drive it with a current", 
    "source, and I'm going to label that as the input i.", 
    "There's an inductor in parallel with a resistor in", 
    "parallel with a capacitor.", 
    "Inductance L, resistance R, capacitance C. I am going to", 
    "pick this as my ground node here, and let's say the", 
    "voltage here is v. OK, so the voltage is v, and that's the", 
    "voltage across the capacitor, the", 
    "resistor, and the inductor.", 
    "And the current coming in out of the current", 
    "source here is i.", 
    "OK, so my goal here is to start by figuring out what is", 
    "the characteristic equation for this parallel RLC circuit.", 
    "OK, and I do know that it's going to have the form s", 
    "squared plus 2 alpha s plus omega naught equals 0.", 
    "Let me go and figure it out.", 
    "So let me start by writing the differential equation that", 
    "governs the behavior of the circuit.", 
    "Let me write the node equation for the node with voltage v,", 
    "and then take it from there.", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "The current through the capacitor is C dv dt.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "C dv dt.", 
    "The current through the resistor is simply plus v", 
    "divided by R, and summing the currents leaving the node, OK?", 
    "So the node method, we divide by R at 0.", 
    "OK, current i is entering the node, and so therefore I will", 
    "write that as minus i.", 
    "Finally, the current going down here is going to be given", 
    "by 1 divided by L minus infinity to t v dt.", 
    "Remember, L di dt is the voltage across the resistor.", 
    "So I is 1 divided by L integral v dt.", 
    "And since those are all the currents leaving that node,", 
    "they sum to 0.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So the next step, let me get rid of the integral and", 
    "differentiate throughout with respect to t.", 
    "And let me also go ahead and divide by C. So divide by C", 
    "and differentiate throughout by d by dt.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "I get d squared v by dt squared.", 
    "I get 1 by RC dv by dt.", 
    "Let me take i to the right hand side,", 
    "let me stick it there.", 
    "And then I get one by L, I divide by C, v", 
    "is what I have here.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So I'm very, very quickly able to write the differential", 
    "equation that governs the behavior of", 
    "this parallel circuit.", 
    "It was very, very easy to do that.", 
    "Now, in order to get the homogeneous equation, I just", 
    "set the drive to 0.", 
    "And by setting the drive to 0.", 
    "I get--", 
    "so if I set this to 0 for homogeneous equation.", 
    "Recall the way I get the characteristic equation is in", 
    "finding the solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So I set that to 0.", 
    "The next step is to find the solution to", 
    "the homogeneous equation.", 
    "I substitute, I assume a solution of the form A e", 
    "raised to st for the homogeneous solution.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So I make this assumption for v, and I go ahead and", 
    "substitute it.", 
    "What do I get?", 
    "So if I stick in A e raised to st in place of v, then I get", 
    "the following.", 
    "I get, for d squared v by dt squared I get an", 
    "s squared out there.", 
    "And then I get A e raised to st out there.", 
    "Now, notice that I'm going to get an A e raised to st for", 
    "the first term, for the second term, and for the third term,", 
    "and the 0 out here.", 
    "So I know that I'm going to be able to cancel A e raised to", 
    "st throughout, so I'm just going to ignore that.", 
    "I'm not going to go and write it all out.", 
    "I'm just going to skip a couple of steps.", 
    "So here I'm going to get 1 by RC times s, and then here I", 
    "will get a 1 by LC, and that's it.", 
    "And that is equal to 0.", 
    "This is it.", 
    "That is my characteristic equation.", 
    "So it is s squared characteristic equation for", 
    "parallel RLC circuit is given by s squared plus s divided by", 
    "RC plus 1 by LC equals 0.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So that's my characteristic equation for the", 
    "parallel RLC circuit.", 
    "So now I'm in a position to directly", 
    "write down the various--", 
    "let me switch to red here--", 
    "I can quickly write down the values of alpha, omega", 
    "naught, and so on.", 
    "So I can very quickly compare.", 
    "So 2 alpha can be compared to RC here, and as before for the", 
    "series, omega naught compares to LC.", 
    "OK, so let me go ahead and write all of", 
    "these things down.", 
    "So I get alpha equals 1 divided by 2 RC.", 
    "And I get omega naught equals 1 divided by", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "And omega d, as always, is omega naught squared minus", 
    "alpha squared.", 
    "This is assuming that the circuit is under damped.", 
    "And q, as always, is, for the underdamped circuit, omega", 
    "naught by two alpha.", 
    "So, notice that I can have small values of Q. So even if", 
    "the circuit is overdamped, I can get a very, very low Q for", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "So omega naught is always 1 by a square root of LC, and I", 
    "have an alpha, and so it turns out that for critical", 
    "damping, Q is half.", 
    "And if Q is greater that half, then it's underdamped, and if", 
    "Q is less than half, then it is overdamped.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So notice how quickly I was able to write down the", 
    "differential equation, and from there, develop the", 
    "characteristic equation, and then write down the values of", 
    "alpha and omega naught from which I got the values of", 
    "omega d and Q. OK, and once I have this stable of values", 
    "here, I could very, very quickly write out the wave", 
    "form that describes the behavior of the circuit.", 
    "OK?", 
    "For voltage v, for instance.", 
    "And again, remember very quickly how I was able to", 
    "write down the characteristic equation here.", 
    "Notice that if I have a d squared v by dt squared, that", 
    "results in an s squared.", 
    "Then I have a 1 by RC here, dv by dt results in an s.", 
    "And one by LCv simply results in 1 divided by LC.", 
    "OK?", 
    "In later courses, you will realize that this s here,", 
    "you'll see this s again and again.", 
    "There will be a mathematical technique called Laplace",
