    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "So we've analyzed the circuit using the analytical method.", 
    "And recall, this was our circuit.", 
    "We had a little dependent source here.", 
    "There's a V naught RL VS, and I had a plus minus vI supply", 
    "coming in here.", 
    "So this was my gate, drain, and source terminals.", 
    "So what I'm going to do next is analyze this little circuit", 
    "using the graphical method.", 
    "And to do that, I want to start off with the two", 
    "equations that I'd marked for you earlier.", 
    "Recall, I had marked equation with the red A and a green B,", 
    "and I'm just copying those equations out here again.", 
    "So this equation simply captures the current-source", 
    "relation for the MOSFET in its saturation region, and this", 
    "equation is simply captures the writing of the node", 
    "equation at the node with voltage V naught.", 
    "So let me make some progress from there, and go ahead and", 
    "try out the graphical method for", 
    "analyzing this system here.", 
    "So recall first of all that for the MOSFET, given its", 
    "characteristics--", 
    "iDS equals K divided by 2 vi minus Vt all squared, I'm", 
    "giving you the curves here.", 
    "So here are my current source curves, and of course this was", 
    "for VGS greater than or equal to Vt.", 
    "And recall that this point, this curve here, with the", 
    "knee, or each of the current source curves appears, is for", 
    "vDS equals vGS minus Vt.", 
    "And I can express the constraint in a slightly", 
    "different way.", 
    "This constraint that I've shown you is expressed as a", 
    "constraint between vDS and vGS.", 
    "Recall vGS is my third variable here, which is input", 
    "voltage, which varies, and gives me a family of curves.", 
    "Now, I can also express the same constraint as a function", 
    "of iDS and vDS.", 
    "How do I go about doing that?", 
    "So what I can do is notice that I can punch in--", 
    "so at this point, vDS equals vGS minus vT.", 
    "So in terms of v naught, I can write that down as--", 
    "so the saturation region begins for v naught", 
    "equals vI minus vT.", 
    "So then what I can do is I can now substitute--", 
    "so I should say, saturation begins.", 
    "Because for saturation is when v naught is greater than or", 
    "equal to vI minus vT.", 
    "So in this case, what I'm going to do is notice here", 
    "that this is vI minus vT, and I see a vI minus vT here.", 
    "So what I'm going to do, is I am going to substitute v", 
    "naught up there in place of vI minus vT.", 
    "And as soon as I do that, here is what I get.", 
    "I get iDS is equal to, or I get for iDS--", 
    "in other words, my constraint applies as follows, where iDS,", 
    "and we'll get the signs right, we'll get the less than or", 
    "greater than in a second.", 
    "But if I look at the right-hand side here, the", 
    "right-hand side is k divided by 2 v naught squared.", 
    "So I replace vI minus vT by v naught, and so I get v naught", 
    "squared, and k divided by 2.", 
    "Notice that my saturation region constraint applies when", 
    "v naught is greater than or equal to vI minus vT.", 
    "So saturation applies when v naught is greater than or", 
    "equal to vI minus vT.", 
    "Which means that if vI minus vT is substituted here, then", 
    "iDS must be less than or equal to vI minus vT.", 
    "So in other words, this is what I get.", 
    "So this is true for saturation region operation.", 
    "Let's stare at that for a second again.", 
    "So that says that when I get into saturation region", 
    "operation when K divided by 2v naught squared is", 
    "greater than iDS.", 
    "How did I get that?", 
    "To revisit this, my constraint is a v naught greater than or", 
    "equal to vI minus vT.", 
    "So vI minus vT is a smaller quantity, so it has to be a", 
    "smaller quantity than v naught.", 
    "So if I substitute for v naught, then v naught is a", 
    "larger quantity than vI minus vT.", 
    "So if I substitute a larger quantity for vI have minus vT,", 
    "then that must be greater than iDS.", 
    "So v naught is greater than vI minus vT, the right-hand side", 
    "would be greater than iDS.", 
    "So the expression for the constraint would be iDS less", 
    "than, equal to K divided by 2 v naught squared.", 
    "So that's up my first graph that I'm going to use.", 
    "And so here is the one graph representing my device", 
    "equation, and I've got this constraint expressed in two", 
    "ways, as vDS, vGS, and vT.", 
    "And the second way I've expressed this constraint is", 
    "in a constraint between iDS and v naught squared.", 
    "Notice that the iDS equals some constant times v naught", 
    "squared is more naturally reflective of the parabolic", 
    "nature off the iDS versus vDS relationship.", 
    "And reflecting that parabolic nature, it simply says that", 
    "for saturation region operation, iDS should be less", 
    "than or equal to K divided by 2 of v naught squared.", 
    "Now let's go to the second equation.", 
    "And the second equation is given by B here.", 
    "v naught equals vS minus iDS RL.", 
    "And so what I'm going to do is-- remember, for the", 
    "graphical method, I'll need to express two equations, one for", 
    "the device relationship, which is potentially non-linear, and", 
    "the other one for the relationship that governs the", 
    "node behavior at the node in question.", 
    "So let me pull iDS to the left-hand side so both A and B", 
    "give me iDS, so that I can start merging the two curves.", 
    "So I get iDS equals something.", 
    "So what is that?", 
    "Well, let me divide both sides by RL.", 
    "So I get v naught by RL and vS by RL.", 
    "So if I divide through by RL, I get vS divided by RL here,", 
    "and then RL also divides v naught, and then I can pull", 
    "iDS to this side, take v naught to this side, so I get", 
    "v naught divided by RL here.", 
    "So that's my second relationship, and that's what", 
    "B turns into.", 
    "And so I can plot this equation in my iDS versus vDS", 
    "plot, and let's see, what do I get?", 
    "So again, remember, this is the same as v naught, and I", 
    "have iDS on the y-axis.", 
    "So what happens when v naught is 0?", 
    "When v naught is 0, then this whole term is 0, and so iDS is", 
    "vS divided by RL.", 
    "So when v naught is 0, iDS is simply vS divided by RL.", 
    "Next, what happens when iDS is 0?", 
    "So when iDS is 0, then vS will be equal to v naught, because", 
    "the RLs cancel out.", 
    "If iDS is 0, then vS divided by RL equals 0, and divided by", 
    "RL and v naught would be equal to vS. So I get a vS here.", 
    "So that is my straight line that I can draw like so.", 
    "So I've got two curves.", 
    "One is my iDS versus v naught relationship, governed by the", 
    "constraints of the output node.", 
    "It's simply a statement of--", 
    "really, it turns out to be a statement of KvL at the output", 
    "node, where notice that the output voltage is given by", 
    "subtracting a voltage from the power supply.", 
    "And so that is simply a constraint of KvL.", 
    "And that, I want to superimpose on top of my", 
    "device relation in order to get the current based on the", 
    "graphical method."
