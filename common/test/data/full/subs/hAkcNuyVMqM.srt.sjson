    "SPEAKER: Let me now go ahead and plot the voltages and", 
    "currents for this little circuit that I had, the", 
    "capacitor and the inductor with VC, where were given that", 
    "could VC of 0 was V volts.", 
    "And this was IC, and IC of 0 was 0.", 
    "So for that, and the solutions we wrote down where VC was", 
    "given by V cosine omega0t, and IC was given as minus CV", 
    "omega0 sine omega0t.", 
    "So I can very quickly plot out VC and IC for you.", 
    "So let me go ahead and plot it with respect to omega0t.", 
    "So I'll do both current and voltage", 
    "with respect to omega0t.", 
    "So I go 0.", 
    "This is pi.", 
    "This is 2 pi.", 
    "This is pi/2, and this is 3 pi/2.", 
    "Similarly for the current, I get 0, I get pi, I get pi/2, 3", 
    "pi/2, and 2 pi.", 
    "So for the voltage, it's pretty straightforward.", 
    "So in this case, my 0 is not actually here.", 
    "I'm going to take my 0 to be here.", 
    "It's symmetric, because I don't have the VI offset, due", 
    "to the input.", 
    "So I get a pretty straightforward cosine wave", 
    "form that will look like this.", 
    "It's a terrible cosine, but you get the idea.", 
    "Let me redraw it a little bit more carefully.", 
    "That's a better cosine.", 
    "So it should be 0 at pi/2, and 0 at 3 pi/2.", 
    "So that's the voltage.", 
    "And for the current, it is a sinusoid.", 
    "And in this case, it goes from CV omega0.", 
    "And on the negative side, CV minus CV omega0.", 
    "So at time t equal to 0, sinusoid is 0.", 
    "So the sine omega0t is 0, so I get a 0 out there.", 
    "And then at pi/2, I get a minus 1.", 
    "So this is what I have. And so I'm going to get something", 
    "that looks like this, and so on.", 
    "So in this case, at pi/2, I get a minus CV omega0, and 3", 
    "pi/2, I get a plus CV omega0.", 
    "So that is as far as VC and IC are concerned.", 
    "Now let me do something very, very interesting.", 
    "This part is a lot of fun.", 
    "So just as reference for you, let me draw the circuit again", 
    "with the inductor and capacitor.", 
    "Let's say the energy in the capacitor is EC, and the", 
    "energy in the inductor at any given point in time is EL.", 
    "And there again, let me plot it out as a function or", 
    "omega0t, pi/2, pi, 3 pi/2.", 
    "I get a pi here.", 
    "I get a pi/2.", 
    "And I get a 3 pi/2 out here.", 
    "So I'm going to plot EC on this side, and EL on the", 
    "right-hand side.", 
    "The energy plots for the capacitor inductor circuits", 
    "are very, very interesting.", 
    "So for the energy plot, I use 1/2 CV squared for the", 
    "capacitive energy.", 
    "So for the capacitor, the energy is 1/2 CVC squared.", 
    "And for the inductor, the energy is 1/2 LIC squared.", 
    "Recall the same current is flowing through the inductor", 
    "and the capacitor, so this is IC.", 
    "And this is VC.", 
    "So we plotted the value.", 
    "We plotted the wave form for VC and for IC, and so we can", 
    "just take the square and multiply it by 1/2 C. And so", 
    "here is what we end up with.", 
    "So we'll end up with something that looks like this.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "So the energy for the capacitor will look like this.", 
    "And this is 1/2 CVC squared.", 
    "If V was the initial voltage of the capacitor, then that is", 
    "at any given point.", 
    "Then at the peak, the energy across the capacitor will be", 
    "1/2 CV squared, where we were given that the voltage across", 
    "the capacitor at V of 0 was capital V.", 
    "Similarly for the inductor, we can draw the same.", 
    "We can take 1/2 LI squared.", 
    "And this is what we get, and so on.", 
    "And in this case, what is interesting is that the energy", 
    "stored across the capacitor initially, which is 1/2 C", 
    "capital V squared, and then the energy sloshes back and", 
    "forth between the inductor and capacitor.", 
    "The total here is the same as the total for the", 
    "peak for the capacitor.", 
    "And this is 1/2 C capital V squared.", 
    "So it's the same total energy.", 
    "And if you start from time t equal to 0, let's just watch", 
    "the progression as you saw in the little video I showed you.", 
    "It starts off at 1/2 CV squared", 
    "completely on the capacitor.", 
    "And the energy on the inductor is 0.", 
    "And then what happens is that, as the energy on the capacitor", 
    "falls down, because the capacitor begins to discharge,", 
    "and the energy begins to build up in the inductor, like so.", 
    "Energy builds up in the inductor.", 
    "And then after some time, all the energy in the inductor and", 
    "the energy in the capacitor at pi/2 is 0.", 
    "So you can notice that the sum of the two", 
    "energies is a constant.", 
    "So 1/2 CVC squared plus 1/2 LIC squared is equal to the", 
    "total initial energy in the system, which is 1/2 C capital", 
    "V squared, where V was the initial", 
    "voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "Again, very, very interesting.", 
    "The beauty of these systems, this purely inductive and", 
    "capacitive circuit without resistances, is that it does", 
    "not dissipate energy.", 
    "Put energy to the capacitor and the energy sits there", 
    "bouncing back and forth, sloshing back and forth", 
    "between the inductor and the capacitor.", 
    "So at some point, the capacitor voltage is 0.", 
    "And there's a current through the inductor, and so all the", 
    "energy is in the inductor.", 
    "And there's no charge in the capacitor.", 
    "There's no voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "energy And this is similar to many, many mechanical systems.", 
    "You may recall a pendulum.", 
    "So a pendulum that is swinging back and forth, the energy", 
    "bounces back and forth between potential", 
    "energy and kinetic energy.", 
    "And if there's no damping, then the oscillator would just", 
    "keep oscillating.", 
    "The pendulum would keep oscillating forever, and its", 
    "energy would slosh back and forth between potential energy", 
    "and kinetic energy.", 
    "In the same manner, with the inductor and the capacitor, it", 
    "sits there oscillating.", 
    "And the energy sloshes back and forth as capacitive energy", 
    "or stored energy in the inductor.", 
    "So that's a very, very important point.", 
    "Let's quickly write that down so we have it as notes.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "So let me do this for just a little while longer.", 
    "So I start off with all the energy in the capacitor, and", 
    "then, much like in the pendulum, where when the", 
    "pendulum stops at its highest point, all the energy is", 
    "potential energy.", 
    "So after some time, my current goes up until such time as the", 
    "capacitor voltage goes to 0, or the pendulum is at its", 
    "lowest point.", 
    "And there's a current in the highest", 
    "current in the inductor.", 
    "And all the energy is now stored in the inductor.", 
    "And then it goes back to the capacitor, and it sloshes back", 
    "and forth between the capacitor and the inductor.", 
    "And at any given point in time, if you sum up-- so let's", 
    "say I picked some point in time here.", 
    "If I measured this energy and this energy, they will total", 
    "up to the total energy, 1/2 C capital V squared.", 
    "This is a very, very interesting thing.", 
    "And so, in fact, you can solve many circuits simply by using", 
    "energy principles.", 
    "So for example, I could ask a question that says, if my", 
    "initial voltage in the capacitor was V, what would be", 
    "the highest current that would flow through the inductor?", 
    "So if I knew the capacitance and inductance, you should be", 
    "able to tell me what that is, purely from energy principles.", 
    "So energy ideas are very, very important."
