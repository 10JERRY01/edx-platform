    "So going ahead, we are going to deal with abstract", 
    "capacitors, with a symbol that is going to look like this.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So let's start by looking at this abstract element called", 
    "the capacitor.", 
    "So as I said, one way of building a capacitor is using", 
    "a pair of parallel plates.", 
    "So let's say I take a pair of parallel plates.", 
    "I can draw this out nicely for you.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "If I take a pair of parallel plates and I connect a wire to", 
    "one of these plates, and I connect a second wire to the", 
    "other plate, what I do then is, in this parallel plate", 
    "capacitor, if I apply a positive potential up here,", 
    "then I'm going to get a set of positive charges on that", 
    "plate, and I get a set of negative", 
    "charges on this plate.", 
    "Positive, positive, negative, and negative.", 
    "So I get a parallel plate system like that.", 
    "So let us say that the area of the parallel plate capacitor", 
    "is A. Let us say that the thickness of the dielectric or", 
    "the material between the plates of the capacitor, is d.", 
    "And so this is insulating material.", 
    "And let's say that the permittivity of this material", 
    "is epsilon.", 
    "So the capacitor has some insulating material between", 
    "the plates, and the", 
    "permittivity of that is epsilon.", 
    "What I can do next is straight write down the formula for", 
    "capacitance.", 
    "You've probably seen this in high school or in a number of", 
    "places as well.", 
    "I can express the capacitance in terms of the permittivity", 
    "of the dielectric, or the insulating material between", 
    "the capacitance, the area, and the", 
    "thickness between the plates.", 
    "In fact, before I write it down, you may want to hit the", 
    "pause button at the end of my sentence, and think about it", 
    "for yourself before I actually go and write it down.", 
    "So hopefully you had a chance to think about it quickly.", 
    "So the capacitance is simply given by epsilon", 
    "A divided by d.", 
    "So not surprisingly, if my area increases, then my", 
    "capacitance increases, and similarly, if the distance", 
    "between the plates increases, my capacitance will decrease.", 
    "I can write an electric symbol, a circuit symbol for", 
    "the capacitor, and symbol is simply reminiscent of the", 
    "parallel plates of the capacitor and looks like this.", 
    "The capacitance, C, and we'll have some current, i.", 
    "And I can apply some voltage, v, at the", 
    "terminals of the capacitor.", 
    "Now, I have a constituent relationship with the", 
    "capacitor, so if there's a charge, q, on the capacitor--", 
    "so this would be the positive charge on one of the", 
    "plates, charge q--", 
    "then q is given by Cv. The q is the charge on the", 
    "capacitor, and v is the voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "The units for charge are in coulombs.", 
    "Units of voltage for v is of course volts.", 
    "I'm just going to put my potential difference here.", 
    "And the capacitance, C, is farads.", 
    "Capacitance, the units for them are farads.", 
    "And so notice that a farad is a coulomb or a volt.", 
    "So they can be expressed as coulombs or volts as well.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So q equals Cv is the basic constituent relation for a", 
    "capacitor, and this is a valid circuit element.", 
    "We will see that it is a linear element under certain", 
    "conditions, and for all of 6.002x, we will view it as an", 
    "ideal linear element.", 
    "Now it's also worthwhile pointing out that this", 
    "capacitor obeys the discrete matter discipline.", 
    "It obeys DMD.", 
    "It observes our lumped matter discipline.", 
    "So the reason it obeys our lumped matter discipline is", 
    "the following.", 
    "Notice that it may appear that it doesn't.", 
    "You say, whoa, we now have all this charge around here.", 
    "But in the early lectures, recall we said that I have to", 
    "build my circuits in a way that I don't have accumulation", 
    "of charge in my elements.", 
    "And now here I'm accumulating charge.", 
    "What the heck is going on?", 
    "Anybody have any idea?", 
    "Well, again, feel free to hit the pause button after this", 
    "sentence and think about it, and then I'll", 
    "give you the answer.", 
    "OK, hopefully you've been able to derive the answer or think", 
    "about the answer yourself.", 
    "But here's the basic idea.", 
    "What we said with regard to the DMD is that if I have some", 
    "element and then I put a box around the element, then DMD", 
    "said that there should be no net accumulation of charge", 
    "inside the element.", 
    "So whatever current flowed in must flow out.", 
    "I should not have any net accumulation of charge inside", 
    "my element.", 
    "And in fact, that was the principle by which I was able", 
    "to develop things like KCL and so on.", 
    "So notice in the capacitor, this is still true.", 
    "So this is my capacitor.", 
    "So if I put a box around the capacitor, notice that if I", 
    "have some charge on one plate, it is exactly balanced by a", 
    "negative charge on the other plate.", 
    "So notice that for the capacitor as well, there is no", 
    "net charge in element.", 
    "And so therefore, because there's no net charge in the", 
    "element, the capacitor also observes my discrete or lumped", 
    "matter discipline.", 
    "And let me just write that down.", 
    "So total charge on cap equals plus q minus q, equals 0.", 
    "So when we say that the charge on the capacitor is q, what we", 
    "really mean to say, and what is technically precise, is", 
    "that the charge in this case on the parallel plate of the", 
    "capacitor is plus q.", 
    "Notice that it is counter by a negative charge on the other", 
    "plate of the capacitor, resulting", 
    "in a net zero charge.", 
    "But when we say a charge q, we really mean a charge of one of", 
    "the plates of the capacitor.", 
    "So our capacitor also obeys our lumped matter discipline,", 
    "and so therefore we can happily take it into our EECS", 
    "playground and go ahead and have fun using it.", 
    "So let's get started and start using this capacitor and", 
    "having fun.", 
    "It creates a whole bunch of really, really fun kinds of", 
    "outputs, and a fun set of behaviors that we haven't been", 
    "able to see so far."
