    "SPEAKER: Before we wrap us this little unit, I want to", 
    "end on a slightly cautionary note.", 
    "That too much of anything might not be good for you.", 
    "And so this little unit is titled, \"Slower may be", 
    "better.\" And I'm going to show you a little example where by", 
    "trying to be too clever with the circuit, you can run it", 
    "into real problems.", 
    "So you saw that the delay, the rising or falling delay of my", 
    "circuits was related to their time constants.", 
    "Related to tau.", 
    "And tau was, in general, RC.", 
    "In some cases this was RT at CGS.", 
    "In the other case, it was RL CGS.", 
    "So fundamentally, if I looked at a circuit, I could increase", 
    "the speed of the circuit by making R smaller.", 
    "And I will do that, so if I had a MOSFET in my circuit, I", 
    "could make this MOSFET larger.", 
    "And by making the MOSFET larger, by making the channel", 
    "of the MOSFET larger, I could make its R on smaller.", 
    "Similarly, for the RL value I could always pick a smaller", 
    "value of RL.", 
    "So fundamentally, by playing around with R, I can make my", 
    "RC smaller and smaller, and make things faster.", 
    "So that's what we learned in the previous little section", 
    "that we did.", 
    "So now, let me give an example, this", 
    "was a real life example.", 
    "And let me show you what happened here.", 
    "So here was the problem.", 
    "A set of students in a research laboratory in a", 
    "university built a chip.", 
    "So they built a chip, and the chip had some inputs and the", 
    "chip had some output So this was pin 1, this was pin 2.", 
    "A chip has a bunch of pins where the input-output signals", 
    "go in and out.", 
    "And these were an example of a couple of pins.", 
    "And so these pins, of course, are being driven by some", 
    "circuits from inside.", 
    "So for example, there might be an inverter driving these pins", 
    "and driving the signals off chip.", 
    "OK, so now what we observed was the following.", 
    "So let's say that we're looking at the signal at this", 
    "point that I'm going to call V. So at this point V, they", 
    "observe the signal.", 
    "So at V, ideally, when they got the chips back from", 
    "fabrication and they put a scope probe out there and", 
    "looked at it, they expected to see something like this.", 
    "For a rising transition at pin 1, they expected to see a", 
    "nice, little step here from whatever, from a low voltage", 
    "to a high voltage.", 
    "But what they observed was this.", 
    "Tragically what they observed was not a fast rise like that,", 
    "but a slow rise that looked like this.", 
    "Very, very slow.", 
    "That was pretty sad.", 
    "They wanted to bring a fast chip, but it was very slow.", 
    "Now, they knew that the reason it was slow was because there", 
    "was a load capacitor here.", 
    "This could have been due to gate capacitance of something", 
    "this was driving, or this could simply be some load", 
    "capacitance.", 
    "When pins drive wires on a PC board, on a printed circuit", 
    "board on which these chips are soldered, there's going to be", 
    "some capacitances associated with it.", 
    "And there's some load capacitor.", 
    "If this capacitor is large, then this is going to be very", 
    "slow because my inverter is going to be driving a large", 
    "capacitance.", 
    "So the students who are doing this said, aha, we", 
    "know how to do this.", 
    "We can reduce the resistances associated with these", 
    "inverters, and we can speed it up.", 
    "So the students decided to speed it up.", 
    "And what they did to speed it up was they took these", 
    "inverters driving these pins, and these inverters had some", 
    "load resistor RL and some on resistance for", 
    "the MOSFETs R on.", 
    "And they made both of these smaller.", 
    "They said, aha, we know how to deal with this.", 
    "We can make them smaller, and that would reduce the time", 
    "constants, both for the rising delay and the falling delay.", 
    "So, so far so good.", 
    "But what happened?", 
    "Something very strange happened.", 
    "Very, very strange and inexplicable.", 
    "So here is my chip.", 
    "I have some inputs.", 
    "I have some outputs.", 
    "This was the node V that they cared about.", 
    "This was load CL.", 
    "And these pins were being driven by a couple of", 
    "inverters like so.", 
    "So this was the chip that the students built.", 
    "So let me keep repeating what I said so far.", 
    "So V, ideally I expected something like this.", 
    "But I observed a slow signal that looked like this.", 
    "And so, I sped it up.", 
    "So sped it up.", 
    "I sped it up by lowering my resistances R on and RTH.", 
    "I reduced them and thereby sped it up.", 
    "So at V, I expected something like this.", 
    "At V, I expected something like this.", 
    "OK, nice, little fast wave form that looked like that.", 
    "But guess what they observed?", 
    "They observed something really, really nasty.", 
    "OK, ideally, they should have observed something", 
    "that looked like this.", 
    "But instead, what they saw was something", 
    "really, really strange.", 
    "Let me pick a different color just to make it very clear as", 
    "to how strange the situation was.", 
    "They saw something that looked like this.", 
    "Something really, really strange.", 
    "What they were seeing was a bunch of glitches, these", 
    "little thingamajigs are glitches.", 
    "And they saw a very, very, very strange signal.", 
    "They had no idea why this was so.", 
    "So they're sitting there scratching their heads saying,", 
    "what the heck do we do?", 
    "And this is a real problem.", 
    "So there was a 6.002x expert who was there, and the expert", 
    "saw the solution.", 
    "The expert said, aha, all you have to do is", 
    "slow down the edges.", 
    "The 6.002x expert said, make the output transitions slower.", 
    "But not as slow as they were originally.", 
    "But from being super fast, make them slightly slow.", 
    "So instead, at V, make the transitions not-- don't try to", 
    "make them look like this.", 
    "Rather, try to make them look somewhat slow.", 
    "And this is what the 6.002x expert made the", 
    "outputs look like.", 
    "And lo and behold, that solved the problem.", 
    "No glitches.", 
    "It completely eliminated these little things.", 
    "So I'm going to pause here, and I'm going have you go", 
    "ahead and check for yourselves, or think for", 
    "yourselves as to what might be going on here, and why this", 
    "might have solved the problem.", 
    "And what I'll do is I'll end with a little demo to show you", 
    "what this looks like.", 
    "And show you the glitches and so on.", 
    "And then you can go ahead and think for yourselves what", 
    "might be causing it.", 
    "And why is it that the 6.002x expert's", 
    "solution really worked.", 
    "And then in the next sequence, I'll cover why this worked and", 
    "what the problem was caused by, and why this 6.002x", 
    "expert's solution worked.", 
    "OK, but I encourage you to go and think for yourselves, and", 
    "let's start with a quick, little demo to show you what", 
    "the problem was."
