    "SPEAKER: Let's go ahead and do the same thing for a resistor.", 
    "That's a much easier case, of course.", 
    "As before, we have the current IL, the complex amplitude, VL", 
    "the complex amplitude of the voltage.", 
    "And we have the impedance, Zr, for the resistor.", 
    "In the resistor's case, of course, Zr is equal to r.", 
    "And so oftentimes you just leave it as R.", 
    "The generalization of Ohm's Law is Vr Zr times Ir.", 
    "So this is a pretty amazing result.", 
    "And notice how Vc is a function of Ic according to a", 
    "generalization of Ohm's Law for the capacitor, inductor,", 
    "and the resistor.", 
    "This stuff is absolutely, absolutely amazing.", 
    "And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to summarize what", 
    "we've seen so far.", 
    "It's a very, very important statement.", 
    "It says that for a drive of the form Vi e raised to st,", 
    "the complex amplitude, Vc of the response, is related to", 
    "the complex amplitude Ic algebraically by a", 
    "generalization of Ohm's Law.", 
    "And the key here is that the exponential", 
    "form makes this happen.", 
    "Let's write that down and make a note of it.", 
    "Let's put a box around it.", 
    "This is extremely important.", 
    "It is this result that is going to give us the next big", 
    "aha moment in this course in the next few minutes."
