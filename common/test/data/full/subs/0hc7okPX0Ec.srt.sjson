    "SPEAKER: OK, so with that quick little review, let's get", 
    "on with today's sequence.", 
    "Today, we will close the loop, so to speak, on our", 
    "observations in the demo by analyzing the", 
    "following RLC circuit.", 
    "So let's start with this LC circuit that you see here, and", 
    "what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick in", 
    "a resistance here.", 
    "So let me stick in a resistance, R.", 
    "So now I have a RLC circuit.", 
    "Previously I had an LC circuit.", 
    "Now I have an RLC circuit.", 
    "I'm going to pick this as a ground node, as before, and", 
    "the voltage at this node will be v. This is a series RLC", 
    "circuit because the inductor, capacitor, and resistor are in", 
    "series, and there is a current, I, that is flowing", 
    "through this series set of R, L, and C.", 
    "Now in the past, as I said for the LC circuit, you saw a", 
    "sinusoidal behavior for the pure LC circuit.", 
    "So where the input at vI went from 0 to capital VI at time t", 
    "equal to 0, we saw that the voltage at v was an", 
    "oscillatory waveform.", 
    "However, now, with R, as a preview of upcoming", 
    "attractions, I'm going to show you that with the R, the", 
    "waveform is going to look like this.", 
    "Something like that.", 
    "This waveform is what you're going to see with R. So this", 
    "will be the decaying sinusoid that we saw in our demo.", 
    "And I'm going to show you that once you add the R, the", 
    "oscillations get what I call damped out.", 
    "And the R provides the damping effect.", 
    "So let's write that down here.", 
    "You get what are called damped sinusoids.", 
    "And I want you to remember the demo.", 
    "In this demo, you saw that we had sinusoids", 
    "that went like this.", 
    "They're damped sinusoids.", 
    "And this is what you'll see here.", 
    "I also encourage you to look at section 13.6 of the", 
    "textbook, where you can get a slightly different perspective", 
    "on the same material.", 
    "Now again, I want to give you this little blurb again that", 
    "you will see a lot of math in the next few minutes.", 
    "And as we walk through all this math and theory and so", 
    "on, I really want you to hold on in there.", 
    "And it's OK if you don't quite follow all of it.", 
    "I want you to get the gist of it and", 
    "understand how we do this.", 
    "It's important that you have seen once how", 
    "this thing is done.", 
    "But then what we will really use is something very simple.", 
    "We're just going to be using a result of all of this theory,", 
    "and the result is very, very simple.", 
    "And if you really want to understand how to solve these", 
    "second-order differential equations and so on, if you go", 
    "to the course info section, we give you some pointers to", 
    "videos and so on that describe second-order differential", 
    "equations and give you some background review material.", 
    "So with that, I'm ready to jump into", 
    "analyzing this RLC network."
