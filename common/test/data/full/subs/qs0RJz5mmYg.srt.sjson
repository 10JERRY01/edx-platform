    "SPEAKER 1: Well, so\nlet&#39;s look at it.", 
    "But does this really work?", 
    "So this is just the logic\nthat I created for you.", 
    "So in this case, my VH here\nis-- let me just make it a", 
    "little clearer as to what I&#39;m\ntalking about here-- my one", 
    "goes from VH to five volts, and\nmy zero goes from V Low", 
    "all the way to zero volts.", 
    "The VH is chosen to be three\nvolts, and V Low is chosen to", 
    "be two volts.", 
    "So the question is\ndoes this work.", 
    "And the answer is that it\nactually does not work for the", 
    "following reason.", 
    "Notice a sender can send any\nvalue between three volts and", 
    "five volts for a one, so which\nmeans that it&#39;s perfectly", 
    "legitimate for the sender to\nsend a value that is very", 
    "close to three volts.", 
    "Let&#39;s say three volts\nis a legal value for", 
    "the sender to send.", 
    "And the receiver will get the\nvalue three volts, and the", 
    "receiver should correctly\ninterpret that as a one.", 
    "So what&#39;s the problem?", 
    "The problem is where&#39;s\nthe noise margin?", 
    "So what if the sender sent a one\nbeing exactly VH, in this", 
    "case, three volts?", 
    "If the sender sent exactly at\nthree volts, then if there is", 
    "any noise in the system, if\nthere&#39;s any noise whatsoever", 
    "in the system, then that will\nmake the value on the", 
    "communication channel, or\non the wire, go into the", 
    "forbidden region.", 
    "And that is disallowed.", 
    "So in a system like this, I\ndon&#39;t have any margin for", 
    "noise because the worst case\nmargin for noise is zero in", 
    "this case, because if the sender\nsends three volts, then", 
    "the receiver cannot interpret\nthe signal correctly, because", 
    "the signal could be in\nthe forbidden region.", 
    "Similarly, for a zero, the\nsender could be sending a V", 
    "Low, and there is no noise\nmargin there, either.", 
    "So what we do?", 
    "So what I&#39;d like you to think\nabout-- and I&#39;ll pause here", 
    "for a few seconds--", 
    "is think about how you might\nsolve this problem before I go", 
    "ahead and tell you\nthe solution.",
