    "SPEAKER: So what we saw in our demo was that although the", 
    "MOSFET did behave like a resistor for small values of", 
    "VDS, as I increase VDS, it began to look more and more", 
    "like a current source.", 
    "And then it saturated at this point.", 
    "So it saturated at this point and began to look like a", 
    "current source.", 
    "So in terms of voltage values, it turns out that this", 
    "transition point where a transition from resistive", 
    "behavior to a current source-like behavior, that", 
    "happens when VDS is more or less equal to VGS minus VT.", 
    "That's the approximate point where the MOSFET makes the", 
    "transition from resistive to a current source-like behavior.", 
    "And then, as VDS becomes greater than that, so in this", 
    "region here, VDS is greater than or equal to VGS minus VT.", 
    "And in this region here, VDS is less than VGS minus VT.", 
    "So notice again carefully that when VDS is such that it is", 
    "greater than a threshold voltage below VGS, its iDS", 
    "versus VDS curve flattens out.", 
    "So let's say as an example here, VGS", 
    "was, let's say 4 volts.", 
    "And let's say VT was equal to 1 volt.", 
    "So in this situation, VGS is 4 volts and VT is 1 volt.", 
    "Then when VDS hits 3 volts, that's when this knee of the", 
    "curve occurs.", 
    "And then so when VDS increases above 3 volts, then a current", 
    "source-like behavior happens.", 
    "But if VDS is less than 3 volts, or VDS is less than 1", 
    "threshold drop below VGS, then we see more or", 
    "less, resistive behavior.", 
    "So let's look at that region of the curve in", 
    "a little more detail.", 
    "So I want to plot and focus on that region of the curve where", 
    "the MOSFET is behaving in a current source-like manner.", 
    "So plotting that out, as before when VGS is less than", 
    "VT, my MOSFET is in its cutoff region.", 
    "And when VGS is greater than VT, then as VGS increases--", 
    "in this case, VGS is greater than or equal to VT, then I'm", 
    "going to see current source-like behavior.", 
    "And let me just start with this curve.", 
    "So when VGS is greater than VT, I start with", 
    "something like this.", 
    "And then I want to see behavior that goes", 
    "and looks like this.", 
    "That's one curve.", 
    "And so that is for some value of VGS.", 
    "Let me call that value VGS1.", 
    "So for some value of VGS, which is greater than VT, I'm", 
    "going to see current source-like behavior.", 
    "And that is going to happen when VDS is equal", 
    "to VGS minus VT.", 
    "That is that point.", 
    "And I said that on the right-hand side, this region", 
    "is called the saturation region.", 
    "Saturation region of operation of the MOSFET.", 
    "To the left-hand side, I call that the triode region.", 
    "So the resistive behavior region is", 
    "called the triode region.", 
    "And then, when VGS is less than VT, that is called the", 
    "cutoff region.", 
    "So it's a triode region, the saturation region, and the", 
    "cutoff region.", 
    "So let's look at that again very quickly.", 
    "Saturation region is when the MOSFET operates", 
    "as a current source.", 
    "Recall the horizontal line.", 
    "Triode region is where the MOSFET", 
    "behaves like a resistor.", 
    "And that is when VDS is less than VGS minus VT.", 
    "And the saturation is when VDS greater than VGS minus VT.", 
    "Now it turns out that my behavior for the MOSFET is not", 
    "quite complete.", 
    "It turns out that for different values of VGS, I get", 
    "some very, very interesting behavior.", 
    "Notice that I still haven't shown you a current source", 
    "that is dependent on voltage.", 
    "Recall my goal as I started out was to try to show you", 
    "that the MOSFET behaves like a dependent current source where", 
    "the current iDS dependent on the control voltage VGS.", 
    "I haven't show you that.", 
    "In fact, that's what I'm going to do right now.", 
    "So it turns out that as VGS changes, so does the current", 
    "to the MOSFET.", 
    "So as VGS changes, so does the current to the MOSFET.", 
    "So if I have VGS2, then my current to the MOSFET is", 
    "slightly different.", 
    "If VGS is lower, I get a slightly lower current.", 
    "And I get a curve that looks like this.", 
    "And if I get a even lower value of VGS, then we get", 
    "something that looks like this.", 
    "And something that looks like this and so on.", 
    "So VGS3, VGS4 and so on.", 
    "So in my MOSFET curves here, notice that all of these", 
    "behave like a current source, just that the amount of", 
    "current is dependent on the value of VGS.", 
    "And notice that this part stays true, that the knee", 
    "point of the curve where the MOSFET behaves like a current", 
    "source happens when VDS equals VGS minus VT.", 
    "This is the transition point and beyond this point, the", 
    "MOSFET behaves like a current source.", 
    "For each of the curves, this point occurs when VDS is equal", 
    "to VGS minus VT.", 
    "And on the right-hand side, VDS is greater", 
    "than VGS minus VT.", 
    "And the opposite is true on the left-hand side.", 
    "So to summarize very quickly, as VGS increases, I get", 
    "current source behavior.", 
    "But the amount of current produced by the MOSFET or", 
    "supported by the MOSFET is going to increase.", 
    "And in fact, as I'll show you shortly, there's a nonlinear", 
    "relationship between the current source current and the", 
    "voltage VGS.", 
    "But for now, let's not worry about that.", 
    "Just understand the big picture.", 
    "Understand the big picture here where when VDS is greater", 
    "than or equal to VGS minus VT, then my MOSFET behaves like a", 
    "current source.", 
    "And the current depends on the value VGS.", 
    "This model of the MOSFET as we go build it up is going to be", 
    "calld the SCS model of the MOSFET.", 
    "It's called Switch Current Source model.", 
    "We look at that and talk about that in a little bit more", 
    "detail in a second.", 
    "But this is called a Switch Current Source.", 
    "And the reason it's called a Switch Current Source model,", 
    "SCS, is that the MOSFET behaves like a off switch when", 
    "VGS is less than VT, and behaves like a current source", 
    "when VGS is greater than VT and when VDS is greater than", 
    "or equal to VGS minus VT.", 
    "Let's do a quick little demo and show you that the", 
    "full-featured MOSFET really has this set of curves and", 
    "look at it when we change values of VGS and VDS, and", 
    "make sure that we actually get all of these curves."
