    "SPEAKER: OK.", 
    "This should now be one of the most fun parts of the course.", 
    "We are looking to explore is there an even", 
    "simpler way to get vp?", 
    "And recall vp was the complex amplitude of the response and", 
    "was given by Vi divided by 1 plus j omega RC, where j", 
    "omega, as I keep repeating, is a shorthand--", 
    "I use a shorthand notation, s equals j omega, for", 
    "convenience.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So we started out with our usual differential equation", 
    "approach, which was a hat trick agony.", 
    "And then we introduced an e raised to st following", 
    "creating the differential equation.", 
    "And we substantially reduced the amount of effort.", 
    "The question before us is is there and even easier, even", 
    "simpler approach that can get us to the answer without even", 
    "writing the differential equation?", 
    "Now this sounds amazing.", 
    "Well, let's find out if we can discover a method where we can", 
    "write down this expression for vp by inspection.", 
    "And, of course, once you write the expression for vp, you can", 
    "very quickly right down the response by taking its", 
    "magnitude and phase.", 
    "And it contains all the information that you need.", 
    "So let's stare at this vp function here, and see if we", 
    "can derive some insight that my guide us to a possible", 
    "easier path.", 
    "So let me start by going ahead and using a shorthand notation", 
    "for j omega.", 
    "This will save me a bunch of writing, so sRC, where s is a", 
    "shorthand for j omega.", 
    "So let's stare at this.", 
    "Hmm.", 
    "What kind of insight can I get?", 
    "You know what?", 
    "Let me divide the numerator and denominator by sC and see", 
    "what I get.", 
    "I'm going to divide the numerator and", 
    "denominator by sC.", 
    "And so what I'm going to get is vp.", 
    "And this is Vi.", 
    "And so I'm going to get 1 divided by sC here and 1", 
    "divided by sC here.", 
    "And here sRC divided by sC is just R. Interesting.", 
    "As I stare at it, doesn't this kind of remind you of a", 
    "voltage divider relationship?", 
    "You have something divided by that something", 
    "plus something else.", 
    "That looks like a voltage divider relationship.", 
    "Let me make a note of that.", 
    "So it looks like a voltage divider relation.", 
    "And if I were to replace 1 by sC with something called zC.", 
    "1 by sC replaced by something called zC.", 
    "And then what I would get is vp would be equal to Vi times", 
    "zC divided by zC plus R. So in other words, it kind of looks", 
    "like if I had Vi here, somehow some Vi source here, and if I", 
    "had some box, R, and I had some box, zC, then if this was", 
    "Vi, then my vp across the zC box would be given by zC", 
    "divided by zC plus R in some kind of a voltage divider", 
    "relationship.", 
    "So let me put this in quotes because right now we don't", 
    "quite know what we're talking about.", 
    "We're sort of guessing.", 
    "This sort of looks like a voltage divider relationship.", 
    "And there might be some insight here that can get us", 
    "to the promised land.", 
    "So let's explore this further."
