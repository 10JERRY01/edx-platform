    "SPEAKER: So my first attempt at building a memory cell", 
    "almost worked.", 
    "I designed my store pulse to be wide enough that the", 
    "duration of the pulse was much larger than the RC time", 
    "constant, RON times C. So that writing of the capacitor", 
    "worked well.", 
    "But the problem was that the storage node here was directly", 
    "connected to the output.", 
    "And that was not particularly nice.", 
    "This storage node here is my crown jewel.", 
    "I can't expose my crown jewel to the outside world, because", 
    "depending on the resistance it was connected to, that value", 
    "would discharge.", 
    "It simply doesn't work with my memory cell abstraction.", 
    "The memory cell abstraction was such that I want to be", 
    "able to read the value of the memory, but the read should", 
    "not cause that memory value to discharge.", 
    "So here's my second attempt.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is the problem was that when my", 
    "output was connected to the load directly, the load caused", 
    "the output to be discharged.", 
    "So the obvious thing that comes to mind is, why don't I", 
    "buffer the value?", 
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a pair of", 
    "inverters so that they behave like a buffer.", 
    "So if this value is, let's say, x, then this value's x", 
    "bar, at this value is again x, So this becomes my dOUT.", 
    "So together, these things form a buffer.", 
    "So does that work?", 
    "Let's try to understand this.", 
    "Will this circuit work?", 
    "If I built a buffer here, then this buffer is going to", 
    "disconnect, decouple the output from the input.", 
    "So the output ends up going to some load RL.", 
    "I couldn't care less.", 
    "I, as the capacitor, couldn't care less.", 
    "And the reason was I was decoupled from the load by", 
    "those buffers.", 
    "So in this situation, let's go ahead and find", 
    "out how things work.", 
    "Let's start by figuring out how long the capacitor can", 
    "store its charge.", 
    "Notice that the store pulse width stays the same.", 
    "Those dynamics haven't changed.", 
    "So to find out how long I store my charge, let's assume", 
    "that the resistance looking in here is RIN.", 
    "now, in an ideal world-- in a completely ideal world--", 
    "the resistance looking into our inverter was infinity, in", 
    "a completely ideal world.", 
    "And the resistance into this terminal of the switch was", 
    "also infinity.", 
    "But let's say in a practical world, there is going to be", 
    "some resistance.", 
    "There could be the parasitic resistance between this wire", 
    "and ground.", 
    "There's some parasitic resistance.", 
    "There could be some parasitic resistance of the switch.", 
    "And there could be some teeny, teeny resistance that is seen", 
    "into the gate, some non-idealities here and there.", 
    "And let's say that resistance is RIN.", 
    "So let's assume it's a really, really huge resistance in the", 
    "gigaohms, in the billions of ohms, a very, very huge, huge,", 
    "huge resistance.", 
    "So let's assume the input resistance RIN is known.", 
    "So that is a huge, huge, huge resistance.", 
    "So under those conditions, let's try to find out what the", 
    "duration for which the voltage vC is such that I", 
    "store a valid 1.", 
    "Remember, again, the governing equation is given by this is", 
    "vC, this is VS, and this will discharge.", 
    "And at some point, it hits VOH.", 
    "So this duration here is Tvalid.", 
    "So what is Tvalid?", 
    "We just computed it earlier, just that the time constant is", 
    "different now.", 
    "So we computed Tvalid a second ago.", 
    "But Tvalid was given by the time constant minus--", 
    "in this case, the time constant is RINC. It's not RL", 
    "any longer, it's RINC natural log of VOH divided by VS. And", 
    "this may be 5 volts, as an example.", 
    "Generally, RIN is much, much bigger than RL, because RL", 
    "relates to whoever was going to read the value of the", 
    "memory cell.", 
    "And we don't have too much control of who's", 
    "going to read it.", 
    "So if I build a little memory, and I sell it on the market,", 
    "but who knows how people are going to design the circuits", 
    "to read the memory cell?", 
    "I have little control over that.", 
    "So now, by putting a buffer here, I get RIN.", 
    "And by making RIN much, much larger than RL, I could do", 
    "much better.", 
    "So as an example, to show you some typical numbers-- so", 
    "let's say, for example, for some DRAM--", 
    "Dynamic Random Access Memory--", 
    "let's say RIN might be on the order of 1 gigaohm.", 
    "This is not unusual.", 
    "Similarly, the capacitance I might use might be on the", 
    "order of 1 femtofarad.", 
    "So a femtofarad is 1/1,000th of a picofarad.", 
    "It's 10 to the minus 15 farads.", 
    "So for that, what is the time constant tau?", 
    "Tau is RINC, and that is 10 to the 12th times minus 10", 
    "to the minus 15.", 
    "So that's on the order of 10 to the minus 3 seconds, which", 
    "is 1 millisecond.", 
    "So notice that because of the RIN--", 
    "which is a huge value.", 
    "It's a gigaohm.", 
    "And for a typical capacitance value of a femtofarad, notice", 
    "that my tau, that is the time constant of the discharging", 
    "here, of this capacity discharging through RIN, is", 
    "about a millisecond.", 
    "So notice how here, I did not go and", 
    "compute the Tvalid time.", 
    "But I just went ahead and did an analysis using tau.", 
    "And here, I'm using a principle that I discussed", 
    "with you earlier where I showed you that tau is a good", 
    "indicator of these delays.", 
    "So you can very quickly just take a circuit, figure out the", 
    "RC time constant, and the delays of the circuit are", 
    "going to be within small constant factor of the RC", 
    "delays of the time constant.", 
    "So in this case, the time constant tau is about 1", 
    "millisecond.", 
    "And what that says is that this is pretty reasonable.", 
    "What that says is that once I have a time constant of about", 
    "a millisecond, what that is saying is that the circuit", 
    "will hold its charge-- the capacitor will hold its charge", 
    "for some time on the order of a millisecond.", 
    "So if I was able to somehow manage to keep writing the", 
    "capacitor in some time which was much less than a", 
    "millisecond, I would be OK.", 
    "But clearly, I would not be able to store my charge for", 
    "much longer than about a millisecond.", 
    "So this kind of circuit is better.", 
    "So adding a buffer to the output is better.", 
    "But it is still not perfect, still not quite there.", 
    "So let's try something else.", 
    "So my second attempt did better.", 
    "I got about a millisecond of a time constant, much better", 
    "than the past with RL.", 
    "But let's see what we can do further.", 
    "So here's my third attempt.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is the following.", 
    "I'm going to have my buffer as before.", 
    "So this is dOUT.", 
    "This doesn't change.", 
    "So this is my buffer.", 
    "That isn't going to change.", 
    "Here's my storage node with voltage VC.", 
    "That isn't going to change.", 
    "So what I'm going to do now is I want to do something active.", 
    "I'm going to be proactive about making sure that my", 
    "capacitor doesn't mess up.", 
    "What I want to do, I know that this discharge into RIN, for", 
    "the values I chose earlier, would be on the order of 1", 
    "millisecond.", 
    "And that still wasn't long enough for me.", 
    "For a kind of memory we sometimes want to build called", 
    "static memory, or SRAM, static memory, I want to be able to", 
    "hold a value forever.", 
    "I don't want this nonsense about I can only hold the", 
    "value for a millisecond.", 
    "Imagine if I ran around the world saying, oh, I can only", 
    "remember things for about a millisecond, things are going", 
    "to be tough.", 
    "I can only remember things for a very short period of time.", 
    "Now, I want to build an SRAM--", 
    "it's a static RAM--", 
    "where it can store a value for a long period of time.", 
    "So here's an idea.", 
    "Tell you what.", 
    "Before I tell you the idea, let me have", 
    "you think about it.", 
    "How much you modify this cell to make sure that I can store", 
    "the value for a much longer period of time?", 
    "Think about how you might solve this problem by", 
    "embellishing the circuit somehow.", 
    "And then you can come back to seeing how I do it."
