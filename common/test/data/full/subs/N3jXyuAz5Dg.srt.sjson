    "SPEAKER 1: In the final part of\nthe lecture sequence, I&#39;m", 
    "going to show you a\nfun little demo.", 
    "In this demo, I&#39;m going to use\nan AND gate, like the ones", 
    "you&#39;ve seen before, and apply\nsome inputs to it in a fun", 
    "matter, and at the same time,\nsuperimpose some noise on one", 
    "of the signals.", 
    "So for example, what I might\ndo is take a noisy signal,", 
    "take some noise, and add\nthat to the y-input.", 
    "And if you really believe in all\nthat you&#39;ve done so far,", 
    "then even if noise is added to\nthe signal on y, then the", 
    "output of this gate might still\nbe pristine, despite the", 
    "noise on the y-input, because\nthis gate is adhering to the", 
    "static discipline.", 
    "If the gate is correctly\ninterpreting its output low", 
    "and output high voltages, then\nthe output must be correct,", 
    "even if the inputs are noisy,\nprovided, of course, inputs", 
    "adhere to the static\ndiscipline.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to apply a signal\nx that looks as follows.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to apply a signal\ny that looks a little", 
    "bit different, like so.", 
    "And so you would expect that\nthe output z is going", 
    "to look like this.", 
    "So my output is going to be an\nANDing of the two inputs.", 
    "So not surprisingly, notice that\nstarting at this point,", 
    "both x and y are a 1, so\nz is going to a 1.", 
    "And then at this point, x goes\nto 0, while y stays at 1, so", 
    "therefore z pops down to a 0,\nand then stays at 0 until both", 
    "x and y go back up to a 1.", 
    "So this is pretty much similar\nto what we did earlier, and", 
    "this is a signal that\nI expect to see.", 
    "Now I want to inject noise\ninto the system.", 
    "Then what is going to happen is\nthat the signal y is going", 
    "to have some noise superimposed\non it.", 
    "And what you&#39;ll see is that\neven with the noise", 
    "superimposed on the signal,\nmy output is going to stay", 
    "pristine because of the\nstatic discipline.", 
    "Of course, if the noise is so\nmuch, so large, that it begins", 
    "to overwhelm the gate, the gate\nis not designed to handle", 
    "the noise, then things\nwill go haywire.", 
    "But provided the noise is within\nthe noise margin, then", 
    "my gate should work correctly.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Watch and have some fun.",
