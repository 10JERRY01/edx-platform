    "SPEAKER 1: So that little demo that we looked at for the", 
    "second time showed us what the wave form at B looked like.", 
    "And we saw that the rise time was a gradual--", 
    "it rose gradually as opposed to suddenly.", 
    "And that was because of the capacitance which we've now", 
    "discovered for ourselves as being the real culprit behind", 
    "that slow wave form.", 
    "OK so we now all set to begin computing the rising delay at", 
    "B for our inverter repair.", 
    "So in our inverter repair, I have an inverter x.", 
    "I have an inverter y here.", 
    "And notice that CGS is the capacitance between the gate", 
    "and the source of the second MOSFET.", 
    "The node B is the one I'm going to focus on.", 
    "This is the output terminal C. And I let me go ahead and do", 
    "the analysis.", 
    "So for this inverter repair, in order to get a rising--", 
    "I want a rising wave form at B. So to get that I need to", 
    "create a falling wave form at A. And that will, of course,", 
    "result in a rising wave form at C. So to get the rising", 
    "wave form at A, let me just sketch out what A would look", 
    "like. t and this VA, this is 0.", 
    "So at A I need a falling wave form just so I can get a", 
    "rising wave form at B.", 
    "OK, so this is my fall wave form at A that will fall from", 
    "5 volts to 0 volts.", 
    "This corresponds to a 1 to 0 transition at A. So this is my", 
    "1 to 0 transition at A, and that will cause a 0 to 1", 
    "transition at B. And I can plot out B here.", 
    "So this is VB and this is time t equals 0.", 
    "So let me switch colors here just so I can highlight what's", 
    "going on at B. So at B, ideally--", 
    "if the world was completely ideal, if the world was", 
    "completely ideal, for input A that is high, V would be low.", 
    "OK, so V would be low.", 
    "And at time t equals 0, as A went to 0, B would go to A1.", 
    "So this would have been the ideal scenario if this pesky", 
    "little capacitor CGS didn't exist. This", 
    "would be at 5 volts.", 
    "And I would get a sharp rise from 0 to 5 volts", 
    "corresponding to a sharp fall for VA from", 
    "5 volts to 0 volts.", 
    "OK, no surprises there.", 
    "However, because of the capacitor, we've seen that", 
    "there's an RC caused delay.", 
    "And because of that, I continue at 0 until", 
    "time t equals 0.", 
    "And then after that, after a long period of time, I do know", 
    "that my output B is going to get to 5 volts eventually.", 
    "And in this situation, because my initial value is low and", 
    "the final value is high, then this model applies.", 
    "It's the rising wave form for the capacitor, and it's going", 
    "to look like this.", 
    "So this is what I observe.", 
    "So that observation is the one I showed you in a little demo.", 
    "And our next step is for this kind of wave form for the", 
    "capacitor node at B, let's start to compute what the", 
    "rising delay is actually going to be.", 
    "So let's dive into that as our second step.", 
    "So I've cleaned up the various wave forms", 
    "here and redrawn it.", 
    "So notice that my capacitor voltage rises from 0 to 5", 
    "volts, and this is my observed value.", 
    "This is y.", 
    "This is C. A goes like this.", 
    "And B is going to rise, and C is going to fall.", 
    "So let me switch colors to red here.", 
    "So how do I figure out what the rising delay off this", 
    "inverter x is going to be?", 
    "I want to find out the rising delay of inverter x.", 
    "So to find the rising delay of inverter x, notice that I need", 
    "to figure out how long it takes for this node-- the", 
    "output of the inverter-- to rise.", 
    "And notice that that relates to the", 
    "capacitance of the next stage.", 
    "Now in real circuits, there are capacitors all over.", 
    "There are capacitors for the wire.", 
    "There are capacitors at the drain of the MOSFET, between", 
    "the drain and the ground of the MOSFET and so on.", 
    "But in our really simple 6.002 life, we will simply use the", 
    "capacitance from the gate of the inverter y as the", 
    "capacitive load on the output of inverter x.", 
    "So how do I know what is the rising delay for inverter x?", 
    "So let's look at the inverter pair here.", 
    "Notice that my output of this inverter starts off being 0.", 
    "It eventually gets to 5 volts.", 
    "Now delay is simply defined as the time it takes for an", 
    "output to get to a logically valid value.", 
    "And that is the technical definition of a delay.", 
    "So in this case it starts off at 0.", 
    "So clearly it's not a valid value.", 
    "If this had gone to 5 volts instantaneously, the delay", 
    "would have been 0.", 
    "But notice that it starts off at 0, and", 
    "then it rises slowly.", 
    "And eventually, let's say the valid value for a high signal", 
    "is VOH, then notice that eventually it reaches VOH.", 
    "So it takes some time to reach VOH.", 
    "That time that it takes to reach VOH is called tr or the", 
    "rising delay.", 
    "So this time is tr.", 
    "That is called the rising delay of inverter x.", 
    "So let me just make it very clear of inverter x.", 
    "So what that says is that the output of inverter x will take", 
    "time tr to rise from its value--", 
    "when its input was a logical 1, it takes tr amount of time", 
    "to rise to a value that corresponds to the", 
    "input being at 0.", 
    "And so that time is called tr or the rise", 
    "time of inverter x.", 
    "So tr is the rise time, and that is the time it takes for", 
    "the inverter to go from 0 to a valid logical output VOH.", 
    "Now sometimes people might define these delays and rise", 
    "times and fall times somewhat differently.", 
    "And so generally, we will be pretty precise about how we", 
    "define them.", 
    "But if you are not told exactly what tr is, then it is", 
    "simply the time it takes for the inverter to reach a", 
    "logically valid value.", 
    "And this case, it's the time it takes for it to go from 0", 
    "to VOH because VOH is a logically valid value."
