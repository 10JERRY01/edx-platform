    "SPEAKER: So here's what I'm going to do.", 
    "So notice that this is my capacitor, and what I can do", 
    "is if I take out the capacitor and put it aside, then I can", 
    "do the usual Thevenin trick.", 
    "I can replace the entire circuit to the left of the", 
    "capacitor with a Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "And if I did that, then I would end up with", 
    "something like this.", 
    "So the circuit to the left of the capacitor would be", 
    "replaced by a Thevenin equivalent, and then I would", 
    "get my usual series RC circuit, which", 
    "is a standard pattern.", 
    "So this is a standard pattern.", 
    "The series RC circuit being a standard pattern, I know", 
    "exactly how to solve it.", 
    "In fact, I can sketch out its response completely by", 
    "inspection, and I am done.", 
    "So really, the hard step in this problem", 
    "is to simply replace--", 
    "find a way of converting the circuit into its Thevenin", 
    "equivalent.", 
    "And let's go right ahead and do that.", 
    "So I've drawn the circuit out a little bit cleanly for you.", 
    "So I'm going to look to draw the Thevenin equivalent for", 
    "the left-hand side of this circuit.", 
    "So let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So Thevenin replacement of the circuit to the left-hand side", 
    "of the capacitor.", 
    "So the Thevenin circuit is going to look like this.", 
    "I'm going to have some voltage VTH.", 
    "It's not VS anymore but some VTH.", 
    "And it's going to have a Thevenin resistance, RTH.", 
    "Then I'm going to see the capacitor.", 
    "And that doesn't change.", 
    "That is CGS.", 
    "So here, this is my ground node, and this", 
    "is my voltage vB.", 
    "So how do I find out the Thevenin equivalent?", 
    "This is pretty straightforward.", 
    "You've done this in homeworks and in your", 
    "second week of the course.", 
    "So let's go ahead and look at that.", 
    "So how do you go about finding the Thevenin equivalent for a", 
    "circuit like this?", 
    "We saw that you could do it in two steps.", 
    "The first step was to find the open circuit voltage, VOC, at", 
    "this terminal pair.", 
    "And the second step was to find the equivalent resistance", 
    "at that terminal pair after turning off all the sources", 
    "inside the circuit.", 
    "So let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So first of all, let's find the open circuit voltage.", 
    "To find the open circuit voltage, if I make a cut and", 
    "cut out the circuit here and take away the capacitor, then", 
    "I would simply have a voltage source connected to an RL", 
    "connected to an RON.", 
    "And in that case, the voltage across RON would simply be", 
    "given by that-- off a voltage divider.", 
    "So VOC here would simply be the voltage between these two", 
    "points given by a vol divider action.", 
    "So VTH would simply be VS times a voltage divider", 
    "action, which would be RON divided by RON plus RL.", 
    "Very straightforward.", 
    "So if I make a cut here and make a cut here and got rid of", 
    "the capacitor, then my open circuit voltage here would", 
    "simply be the voltage that comes across RON, which would", 
    "be the open circuit voltage, which is VS times the divider", 
    "action, RON divided by RON plus RL.", 
    "So I'm done with VTH.", 
    "So that is how I got my VTH.", 
    "The second part is, how do I get RTH?", 
    "So to get RTH, recall the method I had shown you was", 
    "simply shut down all the sources, you open circuit", 
    "current sources and you short circuit--", 
    "you, rather, open circuit independent current sources", 
    "and short circuit independent voltage sources.", 
    "Of course, if you had a dependent source in your", 
    "circuit, then you would have to leave it in there while you", 
    "computed the equivalent resistance.", 
    "So in this case, if I short circuited my independent", 
    "voltage source VS, then what is the equivalent resistance", 
    "looking in from here?", 
    "Well, looking in from here, I have a ground node here, so I", 
    "have one path RL to ground and one path RON to ground.", 
    "So it would be RL in parallel with RON.", 
    "So RL parallel RON is my RTH, and this is simply RON RL", 
    "divided by RON plus RL.", 
    "OK, there you go.", 
    "So that's my Thevenin equivalent, so I now know VTH", 
    "and RTH, and I can straightforwardly go and", 
    "figure out what my voltage vB is going to look like.", 
    "So intuitively, again, let's figure out, is it this form,", 
    "or is it this form?", 
    "The form going up is related to 1 minus T minus TRC divided", 
    "by RC, and the form decaying is given by e to the minus T", 
    "over the time constant RC.", 
    "So which of these two forms is it?", 
    "Well, let's take a look.", 
    "We can do this quickly by intuition, again.", 
    "So vB, notice, starts off being at a high value.", 
    "We said vB starts off at VS. And I need to find out the", 
    "falling delay.", 
    "So vB is going to keep falling from VS down to VOL, and", 
    "that's the delay that I need to measure.", 
    "So in this situation, here I start from VS,", 
    "and then I fall down.", 
    "So it is this form that I'm going to pick.", 
    "So let's dive right ahead and go ahead and do that.", 
    "So to start, I just summarize what we've seen so far.", 
    "I've replaced my circuit with its Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "And the RTH and VTH are given as follows.", 
    "So I can go ahead and sketch out vB completely by", 
    "intuition, as follows.", 
    "This is time.", 
    "This is vB.", 
    "This is 0.", 
    "So by intuition, notice that I start off being at VS. I'm", 
    "told that the voltage across the capacitor", 
    "is VS to begin with.", 
    "So I stick a VS up here.", 
    "But then, after a long period of time, what is the value of", 
    "the voltage across the capacitor?", 
    "So after a long period of time, it's going to", 
    "have some low value.", 
    "And if you look at this circuit here, notice that", 
    "initially, the capacitor's going to--", 
    "since VS is higher than the final low value, the current", 
    "is going to flow from the capacitor to the left.", 
    "So it's going to discharge until its voltage reaches VTH.", 
    "Once it reaches VTH, then no more current flows.", 
    "So this value here is given by VTH.", 
    "And that should be pretty clear from", 
    "the circuit as well.", 
    "If you recall, the circuit had an RL and had an RON", 
    "connected to ground.", 
    "This went to VS. And here was my capacitor CGS.", 
    "So this started off at VS.", 
    "And then over time, this VS discharged into this", 
    "equivalent resistance until it fell down to VTH.", 
    "How did the VTH come about?", 
    "Well, this is VS, and this node, if you notice here--", 
    "if this is VS, this node here is given by the voltage", 
    "divider action across this node will eventually, in the", 
    "steady state, yield VTH.", 
    "So in the steady state, when the capacitor is behaving like", 
    "an open circuit in the long run and in steady state, then", 
    "the voltage here by the voltage divider action will", 
    "simply be RON divided by RON plus RL times", 
    "VS, which is VTH.", 
    "So this node here-- this is my B node--", 
    "this node starts off at VS and then discharges through these", 
    "capacitors, eventually reaching a value of VTH.", 
    "And that's reflected in this circuit here.", 
    "So VTH is my final value.", 
    "And I go ahead and plot this exponential decay out here.", 
    "And of course, I also know that the decay is governed by", 
    "the time constant tau where tau is the RC time constant.", 
    "And what's the time constant?", 
    "In fact, you may want to hit the Pause button right now and", 
    "think about what the RC time constant is before I go ahead."
