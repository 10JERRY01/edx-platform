    "SPEAKER 1: So I'd like to stare at this formula for", 
    "power a little bit and develop a little bit more insight and", 
    "understanding into what is really going on.", 
    "So let me draw my circuit of the inverter.", 
    "So here's my capacitor C and here is my", 
    "input vi, and I might--", 
    "for the dynamic power calculation, I'm assuming a", 
    "square wave applied as an input.", 
    "So I have both a static power and a dynamic power.", 
    "So based on what I see here, if I don't have a square wave", 
    "input, if I take away my input changing, and I apply a 1 or a", 
    "0 at vi, then I'm going to get the expected", 
    "standby power for a gate.", 
    "Expected standby power.", 
    "And that will be equal to my average", 
    "power, my standby power.", 
    "So that will be p standby, p static, that will be equal to", 
    "VS squared divided by RL.", 
    "OK, there you have it.", 
    "So my static power is VS squared divided by 2 RL.", 
    "And just to understand where that comes from, notice that", 
    "when the frequency of my input is 0, if I don't have a square", 
    "wave applied, so I have only static power.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And the reason I get the half--", 
    "I'm going to go through that again-- if the gate is on,", 
    "then it burns power, but if the gate is off, it doesn't", 
    "burn power.", 
    "So let's write some of these things down.", 
    "So in standby mode, f is 0.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So in standby mode, f is 0, so only static power.", 
    "Standby means that I'm not applying any input, and so in", 
    "this case, my square wave input is not going to be", 
    "present, it's tantamount to my f being 0, so I only burn", 
    "static power.", 
    "If the gate is on, then it burns-- if the gate were on.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's say I have this gate in front of me.", 
    "If the gate had an input 1, then it will burn power, VS", 
    "squared divided by RL.", 
    "Let me write that down again.", 
    "If my gate is on, then it burns power VS", 
    "squared divided by RL.", 
    "So this is VS, this is RL.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And the reason the half comes is the following.", 
    "The gate is off, it does not burn any power.", 
    "OK, so in general, I can imagine that the probability", 
    "that any gate has a 1 at its input is 1/2.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So that's why the expected power, the average power per", 
    "gate, is simply VS squared divided by RL, and that is", 
    "divided by 2 because the probability of a 1 applied to", 
    "the gate is 1/2.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So that's the reason why I get the VS squared", 
    "divided by 2 RL.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "OK, so it's VS squared divided by 2 RL, and", 
    "that's my standby power.", 
    "What I'd like to do next is show you a fun little demo.", 
    "So in this demo, I'm going to show you an inverter like the", 
    "one shown on the top right hand corner here.", 
    "And in this demo, I'm going to first just show", 
    "you the static power.", 
    "I'm going to apply a 1 to my input at the gate, and show", 
    "you the static power.", 
    "Then what I'm going to do is apply a square wave. OK?", 
    "You will now notice that, in addition to the static power,", 
    "the gate will begin burning dynamic power.", 
    "The dynamic power will relate to several factors, including", 
    "the frequency.", 
    "So they keep turning the frequency up, you will notice", 
    "that the power being consumed by the circuit", 
    "will also go up.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's go check out the demo."
