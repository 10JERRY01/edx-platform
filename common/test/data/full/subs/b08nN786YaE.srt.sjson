    "SPEAKER: OK, let's start analyzing a RC circuit, a", 
    "capacitor circuit with a resistor, and I'll add a", 
    "voltage source to it as well.", 
    "Before I do that, one quick piece of nomenclature.", 
    "Circuits with one energy storage element, such as a", 
    "capacitor, are called first order circuits.", 
    "Also be cautious that if I stick a bunch of capacitors,", 
    "it doesn't make it a second or third order circuit.", 
    "Because if the capacitors are just strung together in series", 
    "or in parallel, I can add them up into", 
    "one effective capacitor.", 
    "So let's start with a first order circuit", 
    "with a single capacitor.", 
    "So the circuit I'm going to use is a simple circuit that", 
    "looks like this.", 
    "Have a voltage source and vI of t, I put input.", 
    "And I'm going to put a resistor here of value R and a", 
    "capacitor here value c.", 
    "And the voltage across the capacitor is going to be vc as", 
    "some function of t.", 
    "So before I start analyzing the circuit for you, right", 
    "here you should notice something somewhat", 
    "interesting.", 
    "Why is it that I'm analyzing a circuit like this?", 
    "Do any bells ring in your mind?", 
    "Well, what is this here?", 
    "What is this?", 
    "To the left-hand side, what is this?", 
    "Remember, this is a famous Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "This is a Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "And the reason I'm showing you a circuit like this is the", 
    "same reason that I talked about a few sequences ago,", 
    "where if I have some circuit containing linear elements", 
    "like resistors and so on, and I also add voltage and current", 
    "sources to it, where these are independent voltage or current", 
    "sources, then what I can do is I can pull out the interesting", 
    "element and I can replace this whole thing with its Thevenin", 
    "equivalent.", 
    "So if I have a circuit containing resistors and", 
    "linear elements, and I have independent sources as part of", 
    "it, then they can replace the whole thing by its Thevenin", 
    "equivalent.", 
    "And what I show you here is a Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "A voltage source in series with the resistor.", 
    "So what this says is that if you can understand how to", 
    "analyze a circuit like this, then it means that we can", 
    "analyze any other circuit that is more general and looks as", 
    "follows, simply by replacing the rest of the circuit with", 
    "its Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "All right, let's get right down to it, and let's analyze", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "And going forward from here, it is simply stuff that you've", 
    "learned about before.", 
    "There's not a whole lot of new stuff.", 
    "If you analyze a circuit, well you apply the", 
    "good old node method.", 
    "So for the node method, what I'm going to do, I'm going to", 
    "pick a ground node.", 
    "And let me pick this ground node because recall one trick", 
    "was to try to have sources with one of the terminals", 
    "connected to ground.", 
    "That was a valuable thing to do.", 
    "And then, so the voltage at this node is given", 
    "by vc, vc of t.", 
    "So let me go ahead and apply the node method.", 
    "Notice that this node has voltage vI and so there is", 
    "just one node with an unknown voltage.", 
    "And that unknown voltage is vc.", 
    "All right, let me sum currents according to the node method.", 
    "Let me sum currents leaving the node and add them up.", 
    "They all will add up to 0.", 
    "So the current moving to the left here would be vc minus vI", 
    "divided by R. And then the current that is going down", 
    "from the vc node is simply going to be the current", 
    "through the capacitor.", 
    "And if that node voltage is vc, then the current through", 
    "the capacitor must simply be c d vc by dt.", 
    "Then by the node method, this must sum to 0.", 
    "So how did I get this?", 
    "The first term here is simply vc minus vI divided by R is", 
    "the current going left.", 
    "And the current going through the capacitor is simply c d vc", 
    "dt by the IV relation of a capacitor.", 
    "I can simplify this equation a little bit by multiplying", 
    "throughout by R and moving the constant source vI.", 
    "At least independent in terms of it's an independent source", 
    "with a time varying voltage.", 
    "And so we're multiplying it out by R. I", 
    "get RC cd vc by dt.", 
    "And then I get vc here of vc.", 
    "Write that more clearly, vc.", 
    "And then, let me take the vI to the right-hand side.", 
    "That's my independent source.", 
    "And I move vI to the right-hand side.", 
    "OK, so this is my equation that governs", 
    "the behavior of vc.", 
    "It is a differential equation.", 
    "It's a first order differential equation because", 
    "it relates vc and d vc dt in the form of an equation.", 
    "RC here, notice that this is a voltage, this is a voltage.", 
    "D vc is a voltage.", 
    "And since this is dt, RC here has units of time.", 
    "So RC has units of time.", 
    "So we can go ahead and solve this differential equation.", 
    "And as an example to solve these equations, you need a", 
    "few things.", 
    "One of the things that you need is an initial condition", 
    "to be able to solve these equations.", 
    "As an example, I could tell you that go ahead and solve", 
    "the differential equation from t greater than t0.", 
    "And I give you vc at t0.", 
    "OK, let's say vc at t0 is given.", 
    "So this could be one example of something I could ask you", 
    "to solve where I give you a initial condition for the", 
    "variable in the differential equation, and I give you a", 
    "time period based on the initial condition that I've", 
    "given you for which to solve the differential equation.", 
    "So as a next step, let's go ahead and look to solving the", 
    "differential equation for a example", 
    "input initial condition."
