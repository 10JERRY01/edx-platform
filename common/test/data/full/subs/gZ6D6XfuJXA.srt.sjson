    "SPEAKER 1: OK, let me go\nahead and fill in the", 
    "truth table for you.", 
    "So in this case, notice that if\neither of C1 and C2 goes to", 
    "a 1, what happens?", 
    "So suppose C1 goes to a 1, then\nthere&#39;s going to be a", 
    "short here.", 
    "And the same thing\nhappens here.", 
    "Is C2 goes to a 1, then there\nwill be a short here.", 
    "So if either C1 or C2 is a 1,\nthere will be a short circuit", 
    "and the output will go to 0.", 
    "So fundamentally what&#39;s\nhappening here is that if", 
    "either C1 and C2 have a\n1, output goes to 0.", 
    "OK, so this case the output is\ngoing to be a 0, if either C1", 
    "or C2 is a 1.", 
    "Now if C1 and C2 are both 0&#39;s,\nthen this will be open and", 
    "this will be open.", 
    "And so VS will appear here\nbecause this is going to be an", 
    "open circuit and my output\nis going to be 1.", 
    "So what is this a\ntruth table for?", 
    "OK, well this is a truth\ntable for NOR gate.", 
    "Notice one thing very\ninteresting that is happening", 
    "here, which is that because of\nthe pattern we&#39;ve chosen,", 
    "because of the template we&#39;ve\nchosen, there is a natural", 
    "inversion happening here.", 
    "My pull-down network here, when\nthe pull-down network", 
    "causes a short from the output\nto the ground, I&#39;m", 
    "going to get a 0.", 
    "And so usually shorts happen\nwhen the switches have a high", 
    "value on C1.", 
    "Because when C1 is a high value,\nmy switch turns on.", 
    "And when enough switch is turned\non, I get a path from", 
    "the output to ground and under\nthose conditions my", 
    "output goes to 0.", 
    "So when some inputs are high,\neven the way I&#39;ve chosen my", 
    "switching here in my switches,\nI get a 0 at the output.", 
    "And that gives me my\nnatural inversion.", 
    "And so therefore I&#39;ve been\ngetting things like NOR gates,", 
    "and NAND gates, and inverters.", 
    "OK, so before I wrap up this\nlittle sequence, we could also", 
    "build compound gates that\nlook like this.", 
    "And in this case, I have three\nswitches, switch 1, switch 2,", 
    "and switch 3, the three inputs\nA, B, and C. And that I have", 
    "some load resistor\nRL out there.", 
    "And assume that my switch is\nideal, as before, where I get", 
    "a short circuit if\nthe switch is on.", 
    "So let me have you think about\nwhat the output D is going to", 
    "look like if A and B take\non various values.",
