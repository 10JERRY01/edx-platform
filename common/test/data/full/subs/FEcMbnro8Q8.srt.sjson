    "SPEAKER 1: So let me just dive right in and", 
    "try to compute that.", 
    "So those on the right-hand side, just to summarize my", 
    "expression VS 1 minus e raised to minus t divided by RLCGS.", 
    "So I just separated out--", 
    "I've just rooted VS out here, and that's the same", 
    "expression.", 
    "OK, so let's go ahead and compute the value.", 
    "So I repeat that here.", 
    "So vB is given by VS minus VS raised to e to", 
    "the minus t by RLCGS.", 
    "Let me show this to you multiple times so that it", 
    "really sticks in your minds.", 
    "OK, so let me find out what the tr is going to look like.", 
    "So how do I do that?", 
    "OK, so in order to do that, what I need to do is find out", 
    "the value of t that it takes the voltage vB to", 
    "go from 0 to VOH.", 
    "In other words, if I can go and figure out the value of t", 
    "for which vB reaches VOH.", 
    "In other words, what is the value of t for which vB", 
    "reaches VOH?", 
    "And so I can do that by simply solving", 
    "for t in this equation.", 
    "Notice when t is equal to 0, vB is 0.", 
    "So I need to find out what the value of t is for vB to get to", 
    "VOH, and I can simply do that by sticking in VOH for vB and", 
    "solving this equation and figuring out the value of t", 
    "for which vB equals VOH.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "It's all algebra from now.", 
    "It's a pretty straightforward.", 
    "So I can simply write down VS e to the", 
    "minus t RLCGS equals--", 
    "I want to take this to the left-hand", 
    "side, which I've done.", 
    "And then I want to take VOH to the right-hand side and stick", 
    "it out there.", 
    "Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to move VS to the", 
    "right-hand side.", 
    "So let me take it out of here, and I move VS to the", 
    "right-hand side.", 
    "So now let me go ahead and take the natural", 
    "logs on both sides.", 
    "And so I get minus t divided by RLCGS.", 
    "And that is equal to the natural log of VS minus VOH", 
    "divided by VS.", 
    "And I should've said when I substituted VOH here, then", 
    "this would be tr.", 
    "tr is the time it takes for vB to get to VOH, and so", 
    "this is really tr.", 
    "And so I can now simplify.", 
    "So I multiply out by minus 1 divided by RLCGS, and that", 
    "will give me tr.", 
    "So tr would be equal to minus 1 divided by RLC--", 
    "ah, that is not good.", 
    "Let me start over.", 
    "So tr is minus RLCGS ln VS minus VOH divided by", 
    "VS. There you go.", 
    "So there I have it.", 
    "So tr, my rise time, solving it simply is minus RLCGS", 
    "natural log of VS minus VOH divided by VS.", 
    "So again, how did I get this very quickly?", 
    "I know that for t equals 0, vB is 0.", 
    "And so for tr, v is VOH.", 
    "And so I substitute vB in terms of VOH, and this vB", 
    "becomes tr.", 
    "And I simply go and solve it using some algebra here, and I", 
    "get my value for tr.", 
    "So before I go on to the falling delay, let me go ahead", 
    "and use some numbers here to give you a sense of how things", 
    "might really look like.", 
    "So, for example, let me say that RL equals 1 kilohm.", 
    "Let me assume that the VS equals 5 volts, and let me say", 
    "that VOH, for the starting discipline followed by", 
    "inverter, is 4 volts.", 
    "Let me assume that CGS is on the order of 0.1 picofarads.", 
    "So recall my expression for tr.", 
    "My tr was minus RLCGS natural log of VS minus VOH divided by", 
    "VS. So substituting, I get the following.", 
    "I get minus 1 times 10 to the 3, which is my RL, times 0.1", 
    "times 10 to the minus 12, which is 0.1 picofarads,", 
    "natural log of VS, which is 5.", 
    "VOH is 4.", 
    "So 5 minus 4 divided by 5.", 
    "So you can check out my math for me if you like.", 
    "This comes out to be approximately 0.16", 
    "nanoseconds.", 
    "So the rise time for this example of mine is 0.16", 
    "nanoseconds.", 
    "One interesting thing to do is let's just see what RC--", 
    "if I just did RC, what that gives us.", 
    "So let me compare.", 
    "We're just taking RC by itself, RLCGS.", 
    "So RLCGS is simply 10 to the 3 times 10 to the", 
    "minus 12 times 0.1.", 
    "And that is given by 0.1 nanoseconds.", 
    "What is interesting is that the rise time is not that much", 
    "different from within a factor of 2 of just the RC itself.", 
    "So one piece of insight that I want to give you is that you", 
    "can learn a lot just by looking at the RC time", 
    "constant of these first-order circuits.", 
    "And so for delays and so on, if you just don't have time", 
    "and you want a quick answer, simply take the RC constant.", 
    "And the delay of the circuit is going to be", 
    "roughly similar to that.", 
    "So if you were to have just taken RC and say it, if you", 
    "know nothing else, just present the time constant.", 
    "And by and large, the time constant is close to most", 
    "answers that you'll be looking for from these RC circuits.", 
    "So, in other words, 0.1 nanoseconds is not that", 
    "different from 0.16 nanoseconds.", 
    "So now, if I created a digital circuit and the delay was", 
    "simply governed by an inverter, then for the 0.16", 
    "nanosecond delay, the speed, if the speed was governed by", 
    "the delay of one inverter, would be on", 
    "the order all 6 gigahertz.", 
    "It's 1 divided by 0.16 nanoseconds, and that would be", 
    "roughly 6 gigahertz if the speed was", 
    "governed by one inverter.", 
    "But generally, speeds of circuits might be governed by", 
    "anywhere from 10 to 20 delays, so 10 to 20 gate delays, which", 
    "is more normal for modern-day microprocessor circuits.", 
    "And so if modern-day microprocessors were built", 
    "using these funky little gates and funky little RLs and so", 
    "on, then if the delay was related to 10 to 20 gate", 
    "delays, let's say, 10 gate delays, then the frequency at", 
    "which I could plot that circuit would be on the order", 
    "of 6 gigahertz divided by 10 gigahertz,", 
    "so roughly 600 megahertz.", 
    "So notice how, with these RC values, you can very quickly", 
    "come up with these speeds of digital circuits.", 
    "I want to caution you that modern digital circuits don't", 
    "quite use inverters that look like this.", 
    "They use CMOS inverters, and we will study those towards", 
    "the end of this course."
