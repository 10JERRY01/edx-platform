    "SPEAKER 1: So before we wrap\nup our little unit on", 
    "dependent sources, I want to\ntouch upon a key concept with", 
    "dependent sources, which is\nhow do you use them within", 
    "circuits and apply techniques\nlike superposition and", 
    "Thevenin to them?", 
    "Now clearly, if your dependent\nsources are nonlinear, then", 
    "you cannot apply techniques\nlike superposition and", 
    "Thevenin, which relate\nto linear circuits.", 
    "However, if you have a linear\ndependent source, then you can", 
    "apply superposition.", 
    "And again, recall our slightly\nexpanded definition of what a", 
    "linear circuit is for the\npurpose of applying things", 
    "like superposition\nand Thevenin.", 
    "A linear circuit for our\npurposes is defined as a", 
    "circuit containing linear\nelements such as resistors.", 
    "And we also allow independent\nsources, independent voltage", 
    "and current sources.", 
    "Technically, independent\nsources, voltage sources and", 
    "so on, have an offset, and so\nthey&#39;re not linear by the", 
    "definition of a linear\nelement.", 
    "However, superposition and\nThevenin apply for circuits", 
    "containing resistor networks\nand independent sources,", 
    "whether they&#39;re current sources\nor dependent sources.", 
    "Now I can also apply\nsuperposition when I have", 
    "elements like linear\ndependent sources.", 
    "So a linear dependent source\nmight be, for example, let&#39;s", 
    "say I have a", 
    "voltage-controlled current source.", 
    "So my current i, my output\ncurrent i, for the", 
    "voltage-controlled current\nsource might be some function", 
    "of the voltage.", 
    "Now if i0 is equal to, say, some\nconstant a times v, then", 
    "that is a linear function.", 
    "So if I plot i0 versus, say,\nsome vi, then in this case, I", 
    "want to get a graph that\nlooks like this, avi.", 
    "It&#39;s a straight line passing\nthrough the origin, and so", 
    "that&#39;s a linear function.", 
    "However, if I have some function\nthat looks like this,", 
    "if I have i0 equals some other\nconstant b times vi squared,", 
    "then that is nonlinear,\nand I cannot apply", 
    "superposition to it.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So as long as my dependent\nsources are linear, then I can", 
    "apply superposition.", 
    "In fact, if the linear dependent\nsources are within", 
    "circuits, I can also apply other\ntechniques like Thevenin", 
    "and Norton.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and look\nat what the rules are for", 
    "applying superposition with\ndependent sources.", 
    "So there&#39;s a couple of\nways of doing it.", 
    "One of those techniques I&#39;m\ngoing to summarize here.", 
    "So the idea is very simple.", 
    "All you do is simply leave all\nof the dependent sources in", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "So here&#39;s the circuit.", 
    "And you have a dependent\ncurrent source", 
    "or a voltage source.", 
    "And then you have some\nindependent sources.", 
    "Then what you do is as you\npull out the independent", 
    "sources-- you recall the\ntechnique of superposition--", 
    "you shut down all the sources\nsave for one of them and", 
    "computed a partial result.", 
    "And you did that for\nall the sources.", 
    "Well, you just do that for all\nthe independent sources.", 
    "You simply leave in all the\ndependent sources in.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Don&#39;t take them out.", 
    "Don&#39;t shut them down.", 
    "So you simply leave all the\ndependent sources in shut down", 
    "all but one of the independent\nsources and apply", 
    "superposition in that manner.", 
    "And again, remember, this\napplies only when the", 
    "dependent sources are linear.", 
    "And then what you do is you\nleave the dependent sources", 
    "in, and then you solve for one\nindependent source at a time.", 
    "You shut down all the\nindependent sources except for", 
    "one and then compute\nthe partial result.", 
    "And so this is how you would\napply superposition to a", 
    "circuit containing dependent\nlinear sources.", 
    "You can read a lot more about\nthis in the textbook in", 
    "Chapter 3.5.1.", 
    "And just as a final note, I\nagain want to point out that", 
    "when we talk about linear\ncircuits and applying", 
    "superposition to these circuits,\nwe really include", 
    "resistor networks plus\nindependent sources.", 
    "If you look at one of the last\npieces of notes in the", 
    "tutorials for week two, there&#39;s\na description of how", 
    "this is to be done.", 
    "So if you look at your tutorial\nat the end of week", 
    "two, one of the last snippets in\nthat tutorial at the end of", 
    "week two contains more\ninformation about this", 
    "expanded definition of\nlinear circuits.", 
    "It&#39;s one of those slightly funky\nthings in circuits where", 
    "there is an accepted practice\nin the art, in terms of what", 
    "we call a linear circuit.", 
    "And so it applies to circuits\nwhich have linear elements", 
    "like resistors and independent\nvoltage sources.",
