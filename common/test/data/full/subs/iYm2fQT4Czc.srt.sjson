    "SPEAKER: Now that you've seen the VO versus VI curve for our", 
    "little MOSFET amplifier, it's worth taking a moment to", 
    "understand how this fits in with both our digital and", 
    "analog domains.", 
    "So notice that for the analog domain, we've said that the", 
    "MOSFET must operate in its saturation region.", 
    "And this is the region that we focused on for the MOSFET for", 
    "the analog domain.", 
    "And this is its saturation region.", 
    "So in this region, we said the MOSFET was going to behave", 
    "like a current source, a dependent current source.", 
    "And so this was our valid region for analog systems.", 
    "Now, on the other hand, for the other regions of the curve", 
    "that were useful to us in a different domain.", 
    "So for instance, if you looked at what we did in the digital", 
    "domain, we operated digital devices here.", 
    "And interestingly, here.", 
    "Why is that?", 
    "So go back and look at our inverter.", 
    "So let's say I built an inverter using a MOSFET.", 
    "And if I applied a one signal here, a logical high, say 5", 
    "volts for VT equals 1 volt.", 
    "Then I got a VS. I got 0 volts here.", 
    "So it would be in the triode region.", 
    "This is drain and source of my MOSFET.", 
    "And so in this case, VO for the MOSFET, the output voltage", 
    "VO would be close to 0, and it would be in the triode region.", 
    "On the other hand, if I had a 0 at the input, then my MOSFET", 
    "would go into the cutoff region and my output would be", 
    "at VS. And when the output was at VS, I would be up here in", 
    "the cutoff region.", 
    "So remarkably, for digital systems these were the two", 
    "interesting regions.", 
    "And we said that our digital system would operate for valid", 
    "low voltages and valid high voltages.", 
    "And those really ended up in here.", 
    "And amazingly enough, in our analog domain, I looked at a", 
    "quite a different region of operation, which was here in", 
    "the saturation region.", 
    "And this is where VGS or VI was greater than VT.", 
    "And my V0 was greater than VI minus VT.", 
    "So up here, V0 was greater than or equal to VI minus VT.", 
    "And down here, my V0 was less than VI minus VT.", 
    "So this is quite an interesting fact and worth", 
    "keeping in mind.", 
    "And notice that in this region, when the MOSFET is in", 
    "its saturation region, the output V0 is given by this", 
    "expression.", 
    "Let's put this little detour that we took to reconcile the", 
    "analog and digital spaces, and let's get back to our large", 
    "signal analysis.", 
    "So in the first step of large signal analysis, you already", 
    "went and computed V0 versus VI.", 
    "So I just say that.", 
    "So the first step was to compute V0 versus VI in large", 
    "signal analysis for the MOSFET amplifier.", 
    "Now let's go to step two of large signal analysis, which", 
    "was what are the valid operating ranges under the", 
    "saturation discipline?", 
    "Remember, when we built this MOSFET", 
    "amplifier, we took a promise.", 
    "We made a promise that we were going to operate it in its", 
    "saturation region.", 
    "And in order to do so, I guess it's pretty convenient to know", 
    "what those ranges are.", 
    "What are the lowest values of VI and highest values of VI", 
    "for which I will continue to be in saturation?", 
    "So here is the MOSFET amplifier.", 
    "And I've written down my VO and VI.", 
    "And recall that VI is the same as VGS and VO", 
    "is the same as VDS.", 
    "And my current, iDS, is here.", 
    "So what are my constraints?", 
    "So I have two constraints for saturation region operation.", 
    "One is that my MOSFET should not be in the cutoff region.", 
    "In which case, VI must be greater than VT.", 
    "And the second constraint was that I need to get into", 
    "current source operation.", 
    "And so for that, V0 needed to be greater than VI minus VT.", 
    "And we showed in a previous section that this constraint,", 
    "V0 greater than or equal to VI minus VT boils down to iDS", 
    "less than or equal to K V0 squared divided by 2.", 
    "And this was the equation iDS less than or equal to K", 
    "divided by 2 V0 squared.", 
    "This was equation for this boundary here.", 
    "And at this boundary, iDS is equal to K by 2 V0 squared.", 
    "And so what we have to do, is we need to operate in the", 
    "regime to the right-hand side of that constraint.", 
    "So let me mark that down here.", 
    "Now in order to find the valid regions of operation, let's go", 
    "back to how we had done our graphical analysis.", 
    "And for the graphical analysis, we have superimposed", 
    "our node equation constraint on top of the device curves.", 
    "So here are my device curves.", 
    "So this is an example.", 
    "So this curve, for example, is given by iDS is equal to K", 
    "divided by 2 VI minus VT all squared.", 
    "That's my device equation.", 
    "And if you recall, that equation was denoted as A.", 
    "And then what I did was I superimposed the constraint", 
    "related to iDS V0, that was imposed by writing the node", 
    "equation at this node.", 
    "That's from the second constraint.", 
    "So that equation was given by the following.", 
    "So iDS was equal to VS divided by RL minus V0 divided by RL.", 
    "And I had called that B. So I can plot that.", 
    "So notice that iDS versus V0 is a straight line expression", 
    "where the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] offset is given by VS over RL.", 
    "So this is VS over RL.", 
    "And the slope of the curve is given by minus 1 by RL here.", 
    "And notice that when iDS is 0, then VS equals V0.", 
    "So this point here looks like this.", 
    "So this curve, the straight line B, passes through the", 
    "point VS at V0 and VS divided RL of the iDS axis.", 
    "So let me draw a straight line to join these two points.", 
    "And recall we call that the load line.", 
    "So now, what is the valid region of operation?", 
    "Well, not surprisingly, the valid region of operation is", 
    "simply this region.", 
    "That is my valid region of operation.", 
    "And don't forget that this equation here", 
    "reflect the load line.", 
    "So the load lines represented this equation.", 
    "Now, given this curve here, we can look at the boundaries of", 
    "the saturation region operation.", 
    "So what does this curve say?", 
    "This straight line here says that no matter what happens,", 
    "the node equation at the output will control the", 
    "relationship between V0 and iDS to fall on this line.", 
    "So no matter what happens, the constraint driven by the", 
    "output here is that constraint will make V0 and iDS", 
    "traverse this line.", 
    "So no matter what, I can't be off that line.", 
    "Now by the same token, the device expression will cause", 
    "for any given value of VI--", 
    "so let's say for instance I have a VI here.", 
    "For some VI here, then that would mean that this would be", 
    "a line on which the device, the MOSFET would constrain the", 
    "VDS and the relationship between VDS and V0.", 
    "So clearly, the right answer is somewhere on the right of", 
    "this red curve here given by iDS equals K", 
    "divided by 2 V0 squared.", 
    "But we need to find out what the boundaries are.", 
    "So not surprisingly, this is one boundary down here.", 
    "So this is one point.", 
    "And below that point, I get into the cutoff region.", 
    "So that is the boundary of the cutoff region.", 
    "And I will very quickly write down what the constraints are.", 
    "So if I look at it here, my constraints are the following.", 
    "So at this point notice that as VI increases here, my", 
    "device curves start going up above 0 for iDS greater than 0", 
    "as soon as VI greater than or equal to VT.", 
    "So this point here is VI equals VT.", 
    "So that is one point in the constraint equation.", 
    "And the corresponding value for V0 is simply VS. So V0", 
    "equals VS is the other point.", 
    "What about iDS?", 
    "So for these points here, at this point iDS is given by 0.", 
    "So again, recall how I did this.", 
    "I have the valid region given by this part here.", 
    "And that stretches from this point here to this point here.", 
    "And this is the point where I venture", 
    "into the cutoff region.", 
    "And here is my boundary.", 
    "And then this is the point where I venture into the", 
    "triode region.", 
    "So on the left-hand side here, this is my triode region.", 
    "So what is the value of iDS, VI, and V0 at this point?", 
    "So next, I'm going to go look into how we can compute the", 
    "values of VI, V0, and iDS at that point, which is at the", 
    "left end of the saturation region."
