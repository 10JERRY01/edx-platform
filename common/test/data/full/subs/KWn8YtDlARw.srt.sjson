    "SPEAKER 1: Let me do a second scenario.", 
    "in the second scenario, let me pick V naught, which is the", 
    "initial value in the capacitor, to be five volts.", 
    "OK, so in the second scenario I pick the initial value in", 
    "the capacitor to be five volts.", 
    "And let me pick VI, the voltage of the source, to be", 
    "zero volts.", 
    "In other words, the capacitor starts off at some voltage,", 
    "five volts, and then VI is chosen to be zero.", 
    "And such a situation might happen if the input voltage,", 
    "VI, has been at five volts for a long time.", 
    "And then, at time T equals zero, boom.", 
    "It goes down to zero volts, OK?", 
    "So if VI is at five volts for a long period of time, the", 
    "capacitor will be at five volts, OK?", 
    "So if I'm starting my life at T equals zero and I care about", 
    "what happens at T equals zero forwards, so T equals forwards", 
    "here, then at T equals zero, because VI has been at five", 
    "volts throughout the capacitors at five volts and", 
    "at time T equals zero, let's say VI goes to zero", 
    "instantaneously, VI goes to zero, then suddenly my", 
    "capacitor is five volts across it.", 
    "VI has gone to zero.", 
    "And my capacitor starts discharge across the resistor", 
    "R.", 
    "OK, so what does the graph look like in this case?", 
    "In this case, at time T equals zero, this thing goes to one.", 
    "My V naught is five volts.", 
    "And my VI is also given to be five volts.", 
    "So this is five.", 
    "And this is five.", 
    "They cancel out.", 
    "It leaves me with VI equals five volts.", 
    "OK, so I start out my life.", 
    "So my VC here starts off being the same, starts off being at", 
    "five volts.", 
    "And that's not surprising.", 
    "It's the same as the initial value on the capacitor.", 
    "OK, so it starts off being five volts, which is the", 
    "initial value on the capacitor.", 
    "And so let me mark that down as five volts, OK?", 
    "So how did I get that again?", 
    "Well, V naught in the capacitor, the initial voltage", 
    "in the capacitor, V naught, is five volts.", 
    "And so I start off with five volts.", 
    "And mathematically, when T is zero, this part goes to one.", 
    "And so I get VI plus V naught minus VI.", 
    "VI and minus VI cancel out, so I get V naught, OK?", 
    "So then we start off at five volts because all this was", 
    "five volts as well.", 
    "OK, start off with five volts.", 
    "Now what happens?", 
    "So now I'm in the following situation.", 
    "So now I have a circuit where my VI has gone to zero.", 
    "So VI is zero.", 
    "Here is my resistor, R.", 
    "And I have a capacitor that starts off at five volts, OK?", 
    "Now this capacitor is going to discharge through this", 
    "resistor to ground.", 
    "And I'm going to have an exponential decay in the", 
    "voltage, OK?", 
    "So I'm going to get a situation that looks like", 
    "this, an exponential decay in the voltage with the voltage", 
    "eventually going to zero.", 
    "Mathematically, at time T equals infinity, this whole", 
    "thing goes to zero.", 
    "And so we see, finally, it is going to be the same as the", 
    "input voltage, VI.", 
    "And because my VI is at zero volts here for this example", 
    "that I've chosen, my final value is going to be zero, OK?", 
    "And so, therefore, I get this exponential decay.", 
    "And I get the final value, V zero volts.", 
    "And notice here, just like I've shown you earlier, I", 
    "commonly do this.", 
    "I can take the slope of the voltage, slope of the decaying", 
    "voltage, at the point T equals zero.", 
    "And I can find the point at which the slope intersects the", 
    "final value of the capacitor voltage.", 
    "And in this case, the final value is zero volts.", 
    "And so here, this is my time constant, RC.", 
    "So this value here is my time constant, tau.", 
    "And that's given by RC, OK?", 
    "So that's a trick I will use pretty often, find the slope", 
    "of the capacitor parameter where the voltage occurred at", 
    "the initial point and see where it", 
    "intersects the final value.", 
    "And that gives me the time constant for the circuit.", 
    "In terms of the expression for this, notice that VI is zero.", 
    "So if VI is zero, then this voltage here is simply V", 
    "naught e raised to minus T by RC.", 
    "And because V naught is five, this is simply e raised to", 
    "minus T by RC.", 
    "OK, so there you have it.", 
    "I have a couple of voltages, one increasing and one", 
    "decaying right here.", 
    "And so that should give you a quick sense as to how the demo", 
    "may have been working.", 
    "OK, recall in the very first demo that I showed you for the", 
    "inverter circuit, notice that, at B, I had the following form", 
    "of voltage.", 
    "This was T. Recall that, at the point B In the middle of", 
    "the two inverters, I had the voltage that looked like this", 
    "and so on, OK?", 
    "And so exactly describes why that was so.", 
    "I picked this example to exactly match that situation.", 
    "And there you go.", 
    "OK, notice that this increase it came to this one here.", 
    "And this decay here is akin to the decay here, OK?", 
    "So that is why you got the kind of behavior you saw in", 
    "the initial part of the circuit, OK?", 
    "So hopefully, this buttons it up nicely for you, where I", 
    "showed you something that was extremely strange.", 
    "You'd never seen this before.", 
    "And it is some theory.", 
    "And we saw the practical application of that was to", 
    "exactly going to explain the situation we had in the", 
    "initial demo.", 
    "So finally, to wrap up this little sequence, I'm going to", 
    "show you another demo here.", 
    "Sorry about that extra things that showed up there.", 
    "I'm going to show you a little demo.", 
    "And let me just take it out.", 
    "Oh, there you go.", 
    "So I'm going to show you a little demo.", 
    "And let's go right down to the demo.", 
    "And you'll see some interesting curves as I charge", 
    "and discharge capacitors through a resistor.", 
    "And they will look very much like the ones you see here."
