    "SPEAKER 1: Let us now look at a slightly different way of", 
    "obtaining the valid operating range, which was step to of", 
    "the large signal analysis.", 
    "Now, in large signal analysis, recall there were two parts.", 
    "The first part was to find VO versus VI, and the second part", 
    "was to find the valid operating range for the", 
    "circuit containing the device that you needed to operate in", 
    "your saturation region.", 
    "So in this method, we're going to look at computing the", 
    "saturation region ranges by looking at the", 
    "VO versus VI curve.", 
    "Recall in the previous method, we did it by using the IDS", 
    "versus the VO curve.", 
    "For the IDS versus VO curve, I had a bunch of device", 
    "expressions, device curves.", 
    "And I superimposed a load line, but the load", 
    "line was simply a--", 
    "the load line captured the KVL relationship", 
    "at the output node.", 
    "It simply was reflective of the fact that the voltage is", 
    "at the output, and the output loop neared to sum to 0.", 
    "And it was a constraint established by", 
    "that particular equation.", 
    "So now let's look at a different way of doing it.", 
    "And let's look at the VO versus VI curve, and try to", 
    "find out the valid region from here.", 
    "So graphically, let's look at the interesting region.", 
    "So until this point, VI for VI less than VT, the MOSFET is in", 
    "its cutoff region.", 
    "So in its cutoff region, it is pretty uninteresting to us.", 
    "So this is cut off.", 
    "So clearly, that is an invalid range.", 
    "And then this is where my valid region begins.", 
    "And then somewhere here, my saturation region complete", 
    "finishes, and I go into the triode region.", 
    "So there's some region here between this point here and", 
    "some point here that I have my saturation region.", 
    "And I can draw the corresponding points like so.", 
    "So at that point of my saturation region, I get some", 
    "value for VI and some value for IDS.", 
    "And at this point, this point here, we know that VO is equal", 
    "to VI minus VI.", 
    "And for points above, we know that VO is greater", 
    "than VI minus VT.", 
    "And for points below, we know that VO is less than", 
    "the VI minus VT.", 
    "So the challenge is to find out what this point is.", 
    "But supposing we had that, this is my", 
    "valid operating range.", 
    "So my valid operating range starts from VT and goes on to", 
    "some point here.", 
    "So this range becomes my interesting region for VI.", 
    "And we also call that the valid input operating range.", 
    "And of course, this is all for saturation region operation.", 
    "And so, as an example, this might be 1 volt and this point", 
    "here might be 2 volts, and so on and so forth.", 
    "The corresponding output range is here.", 
    "So if my input range is here, my output range is here.", 
    "And let me write that down.", 
    "So this is my corresponding interesting region for V0.", 
    "And that is called my valid output operating range.", 
    "So let's go ahead now that we've defined regions here and", 
    "mapped things out.", 
    "Let's go ahead and find out what these points are.", 
    "So those are the points that define my saturation region.", 
    "And let's go ahead and find out what that range is.", 
    "This is the range that I'm looking for.", 
    "So I need to find these two points.", 
    "And let me rewrite some of these things here.", 
    "So I know that, up here, V0 is greater than VI minus VT.", 
    "Down here, I know that V0 is less than VI minus VT.", 
    "And at this point, the key point here, V0 is", 
    "equal to VI minus VT.", 
    "Also note that I could write my V0 expression.", 
    "So I know that my V0 is given by VS-- this is from step one", 
    "of the large signal analysis--", 
    "is given by V0, is given now by VS minus K times VI minus", 
    "VT, all squared, divided by 2 times RL.", 
    "So I do know that.", 
    "So now let's go figure things out.", 
    "So let's start with getting some insight.", 
    "So first of all, I'm trying to figure out what this point is.", 
    "So at this point, two equations must be true.", 
    "At that point, clearly V0 equals VI minus VT.", 
    "So this equation is true.", 
    "And at that point, this equation is true.", 
    "So this must be true, because this is an equation for this", 
    "curve, and V0 equals VI minus VT is the point at which I", 
    "know that the MOSFET goes into its triode region.", 
    "I could also draw this thing out graphically as follows.", 
    "What I can do is, I can draw a curve graphically that", 
    "reflects VO equals VI minus VT.", 
    "And I can do that in two steps.", 
    "I can first draw a graph for VO equals VI.", 
    "So this is VO equals VI.", 
    "So this is a 44-degree line, assuming VI and V0 have the", 
    "same scale for the axis.", 
    "So this is a 45-degree line.", 
    "I go and draw that out.", 
    "So that's V0 equals VI.", 
    "And notice that V0 equals VI minus VT is simply a", 
    "translation to the right by a distance,", 
    "VT, of the same curve.", 
    "So I take this curve and I translate that to the right by", 
    "a distance, VT.", 
    "So I take this curve and I translate that by a distance,", 
    "VT, to the right.", 
    "So this curve is simply VO equals VI minus VT.", 
    "So this curve here is VO equals VI, and this guy here", 
    "is VO equals VI minus VT.", 
    "So now, graphically, I just find intersection point of", 
    "this curve, that voltage transfer curve.", 
    "That's straightforward enough.", 
    "But if you want to do it analytically, just go ahead", 
    "and solve simultaneously this equation and this equation.", 
    "Either way works.", 
    "And I also know that, at this point here, my VI is given by", 
    "VT, and my VO is given by VS. So that point, I know, is", 
    "given by VT comma VS. So this is my VI, and this is my VO.", 
    "So I know that point.", 
    "And at this point, I know, graphically, by simply drawing", 
    "a line at 45 degrees from the VT point.", 
    "So next, let me go ahead and just grunge", 
    "through the math here.", 
    "There's nothing really new.", 
    "I'm just going to do some [? grubby ?] math and solve", 
    "these two equations for you.", 
    "As I said, this point is intersection of VO equals VI", 
    "minus VT, and VO equals VS minus KVI minus VT squared, RL", 
    "divided by 2.", 
    "Let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "Let me solve that.", 
    "So VO equals VS. And let me substitute for", 
    "VI minus VT up here.", 
    "And since VI minus VT equals V0 at that point, I get,", 
    "straightforwardly, V0 squared RL divided by 2.", 
    "And just pulling terms around gives me KV0 squared divided", 
    "by 2RL plus V0 minus VS equals 0.", 
    "So I can very quickly go and solve that.", 
    "And solving that gives me minus 1, plus, again, taking", 
    "the positive value for V0 based on the physical nature", 
    "of the circuit that I have, I get 1 plus", 
    "2KRLVS divided by KRL.", 
    "So there's my V0 at this point.", 
    "And what is my VI at that point?", 
    "Well, my VI is simply V0 plus VT.", 
    "So VI equals V0 plus VT, which is equal to VT plus", 
    "this value down here.", 
    "So that's it.", 
    "So I've again managed to find out the boundary value for my", 
    "MOSFET to operate in the saturation region, and that is", 
    "given by V0 out here.", 
    "And VI is given by this value.", 
    "And up here, the other point of the boundary region, my VI", 
    "is VT, and my V0 is VS. So this is VI and this is V0.", 
    "So those are the two boundary regions of the saturation", 
    "region of the MOSFET."
