    "SPEAKER 1: In the last lecture,\nwe looked at the", 
    "digital abstraction.", 
    "And we showed that this digital\nabstraction gave us", 
    "tremendous noise immunity over\nanalog signal processing.", 
    "In the digital domain,\nwe focused on two", 
    "values, 0 one 1.", 
    "And all our signals were\ncomprised of just these two", 
    "digital values.", 
    "In this sequence today, we will\nlook at what&#39;s inside a", 
    "digital gate, although you could\ngo ahead and use the", 
    "digital gate abstraction\nwithout really", 
    "knowing what&#39;s inside.", 
    "And that&#39;s kind of the beauty\nof digital abstraction.", 
    "As EE and EECS engineers,\nsomeone has to go and build", 
    "those gates.", 
    "And so let&#39;s take a look and see\nwhat&#39;s inside those gates.", 
    "The reading for the section is\nchapter six of the textbook.", 
    "Let&#39;s start with\na quick review.", 
    "So we looked at the digital\nabstraction.", 
    "And in this abstraction,\nwe digitized values", 
    "into two, 0 and 1.", 
    "We also established the\nstatic discipline.", 
    "And this discipline, we all\nagreed that digital devices", 
    "would meet certain voltage\nthresholds.", 
    "And provided all of these\ndevices met voltage", 
    "thresholds, it&#39;s like speaking\na common language.", 
    "They could all talk\nto each other.", 
    "So in terms of the global\ncontext of things, recall that", 
    "we had our EECS playground.", 
    "So here is our EECS\nplayground.", 
    "And within that playground, you\nhave some region, which is", 
    "comprised of linear circuits.", 
    "And all of the circuits\nare within EECS.", 
    "So some region was linear\ncircuits, and then we said", 
    "that there was this other region\ninside that we called", 
    "digital land.", 
    "And within that, we agreed to\nfocus on just two values, 0&#39;s", 
    "and 1&#39;s, signals that\ncomprised of", 
    "those highs and lows.", 
    "Now, within digital land, we can\nhave sets of devices that", 
    "follow a static discipline.", 
    "So if a set of devices follow\nstatic discipline 1, then you", 
    "could think of all of those\ndevices as being present", 
    "inside this region\nof the playground", 
    "within our digital domain.", 
    "And as long as all the devices\nwithin this group followed a", 
    "common set of voltage\nthresholds, then they would", 
    "all be able to talk\nto each other.", 
    "Now, a different manufacturer\nmight go and choose a", 
    "different static discipline,\nstatic discipline 2, and a", 
    "completely different set\nof voltage thresholds.", 
    "So for example, for a 0, they\nmight pick 5 volts, while in a", 
    "different part of the\nplayground, a manufacturer", 
    "might pick a 0 to be 0 volts.", 
    "Now, both are OK, just that\nthe two may not be able to", 
    "talk to each other.", 
    "So as long as devices within a\nfamily followed a convention,", 
    "or the static discipline, they\nwould all be able to talk to", 
    "each other.", 
    "So in the static discipline,\nwe have a set of voltage", 
    "thresholds.", 
    "So for example, if I have a\nsender, and the sender needs", 
    "to send a set of values to a\nreceiver, then we expect the", 
    "sender to follow a rigid\nset of values.", 
    "So for a 1, a sender\nwould have to send", 
    "values VOH or above.", 
    "And for a 0, the sender would\nhave to send values", 
    "at the VOL or below.", 
    "Now, similarly on the receive\nside, the receiver would have", 
    "to interpret the values VIH and\nabove as a logical 1, and", 
    "similarly, values VIL\nas a logical 0.", 
    "And notice that the difference\nbetween VOH and VIH", 
    "corresponded to the\n1 noise margin.", 
    "So the voltage from VOH could\n[? droop ?] down to VIH, and", 
    "the receiver would still\ninterpret that as a logical 1.", 
    "Now, the region between VIL and\nVIH is an illegal region,", 
    "and we call that\nthe forbidden.", 
    "And it&#39;s illegal for signals\nto stay in there for long", 
    "periods of times, and the\nsignals need to transition", 
    "very, very quickly as they go\nthrough the forbidden region.", 
    "So with the static discipline, I\nmay have some gate, say, for", 
    "example, a NAND gate.", 
    "And so the outputs of the\nNAND gate would have to", 
    "satisfy VOH and VOL.", 
    "And similarly, on the receive\nside, I may have some kind of", 
    "an inverter.", 
    "And the input of the inverter\nwould have to satisfy the", 
    "input voltage constraints.", 
    "So there again, the outputs\nsatisfy output voltage", 
    "thresholds, and inputs would\nhave to satisfy the input", 
    "voltage thresholds.", 
    "So these thresholds really are a\nspecification on how we must", 
    "design our digital gates.", 
    "Continuing with the review, we\nlooked at the combinational", 
    "gate abstraction.", 
    "And in this abstraction,\nwe introduced", 
    "certain sets of devices.", 
    "For example, this\nis a NAND gate.", 
    "And in these devices\nare gates.", 
    "The outputs must be functions\nof the input alone.", 
    "So at any given point in time,\nI can look at the output and", 
    "uniquely determine its value\nby looking at the inputs at", 
    "that instant in time.", 
    "Now, this will be distinguished\nfrom other", 
    "devices such as memory devices,\nin which values can", 
    "be stored inside the devices.", 
    "And at any given point in time,\nthe inputs alone do not", 
    "reflect what the output\nlooks like.", 
    "Second, these gates must satisfy\nthe static discipline.", 
    "So we also talked about\nthe truth tables.", 
    "And so here is a truth table\nfor a NAND gate.", 
    "And the truth table enumerates\nall of the outputs for a given", 
    "set of inputs.", 
    "So for example, if my inputs are\n0, 0, the output is a 1,", 
    "and so on and so forth.", 
    "And for a NAND gate, the output\nis 0 when the inputs", 
    "are both 1&#39;s.", 
    "We also defined digital\ncircuits.", 
    "And we took a set of\ncombinational gates and", 
    "connected them with\nideal wires, and", 
    "we got digital circuits.", 
    "So here is a digital circuit\nwith three gates.", 
    "We have a NAND gate, we have\nan inverter, and we have", 
    "another NAND gate.", 
    "Analyzing digital circuits is\npretty straightforward.", 
    "So for example, if you look at\nthe output at this point, it", 
    "is A anded with B. And there\nis an inversion happening.", 
    "And similarly, for the output of\nthe inverter, it is C bar,", 
    "because there&#39;s an inversion\nhappening.", 
    "And then we can write down\nD as A do B bar.", 
    "and that is anded with C bar.", 
    "And then we take the whole thing\nand we put a inversion", 
    "on top of the whole thing.", 
    "So here is the three-gate\ndigital circuit.", 
    "And I&#39;ve written down\nthe output for you.", 
    "So a lot of digital design is\ndone with gates or higher", 
    "abstractions that are even\nmore abstract than gates.", 
    "So if you look at a\nmicroprocessor such as a", 
    "Nehalem class chip from Intel,\nthat, believe it or not, has", 
    "on the order of a\nbillion gates.", 
    "OK, a lot of gates in\ntoday&#39;s design.", 
    "So it&#39;s close to a\nbillion gates.", 
    "And they&#39;re all multicore chip,\na design that CSAIL at", 
    "MIT, built by graduate and\nundergraduate students here,", 
    "had about three million gates.", 
    "And then if you look at the\n64-core Tile processor, that", 
    "has on the order of a\nhalf billion gates.", 
    "So notice that, in these digital\ndesigns, we very", 
    "routinely bandy about numbers\nin the orders of billions.", 
    "We design circuits containing\nbillions of gates.", 
    "And the reason all of these\ngates can function correctly", 
    "is because of the key noise\nimmunity property, that as I", 
    "connect a bunch of these gates\ntogether, each gate is", 
    "cleaning up the input.", 
    "If I get VIH and if I have some\ngate, if I get VIH here", 
    "and, say, a VOL level value\nfrom some other sender", 
    "somewhere else, then incumbent\nupon me that if I produce a 1,", 
    "I have to produce a VOH.", 
    "And if I produce a 0, I\nhave to produce a VOL.", 
    "And notice that VOH had tougher\nstandards than VIH,", 
    "and VOL has tougher\nstandards than--", 
    "I&#39;m sorry, I should have\nsaid this was VIL.", 
    "VOL has tougher standards than\nVIL, which I interpret as a 0.", 
    "And so VOL is the tougher output\nthat I have to produce.", 
    "And so notice that there was a\nclean-up of the signals being", 
    "performed each time the signal\nwas processed, and that really", 
    "gave it noise immunity when I\nhave billions of circuits and", 
    "billions of gates in a system.",
