    "SPEAKER 1: All right.", 
    "That's one.", 
    "So, let me write down that expression again.", 
    "This is the form of the solution that I have assumed.", 
    "v raised to t is V1 plus K1 exponential to the cosine then", 
    "plus K2 exponential and a sinusoid.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Now let's go ahead and find out K1 and K2.", 
    "What is K1 and what is K2?", 
    "I know all the other stuff.", 
    "I know omega d, let me just write that", 
    "down just to be sure.", 
    "Omega d is square root of omega naught squared minus", 
    "alpha squared.", 
    "Omega naught is one by square root of LC, and alpha is R", 
    "divided by 2L.", 
    "So I know all of those things.", 
    "And VI is my input.", 
    "So all I need to find out is the K1s and K2s.", 
    "So, from the initial conditions, I know v of 0 is", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "And so I stuff 0 into t in this equation", 
    "here, what do I get?", 
    "When t is 0, the sine component vanishes, and the", 
    "alpha t component becomes 1.", 
    "So what I'm left with is the cosine of 0 is one.", 
    "So what I'm left with is 0 equals--", 
    "what do I get?", 
    "VI plus K1.", 
    "That's one equation.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Next, let me write down i of 0 equals 0.", 
    "That's my second initial condition.", 
    "And I play the usual current trick.", 
    "i of t is C dv dt.", 
    "And let me go ahead and differentiate the expression", 
    "on the top right hand corner with respect to t, and find", 
    "the value at t equals 0 for the second initial condition.", 
    "So d capital VI dt is 0, so that term goes away.", 
    "So here, for the next term, d by dt of", 
    "cosine is negative sine.", 
    "So let me start with minus C K1.", 
    "And so this is going to be a bit messy here,", 
    "so bear with me.", 
    "So I first differentiate by parts here.", 
    "So I get C K1, differentiate the e raised to minus alpha", 
    "term first. So alpha e raised to minus alpha t cosine omega", 
    "dt, and the minus sign comes from the minus alpha.", 
    "Next, let me differentiate the cosine component.", 
    "So I get C K1 e raised to minus alpha t.", 
    "And then differentiating cosine omega dt, I get omega", 
    "d, I get a minus here, and I get a sine omega dt.", 
    "And then--", 
    "let me create some more space for myself here--", 
    "and then I get a minus.", 
    "And I do the same thing for the last term.", 
    "So last term is, in terms of K2 here, so let me", 
    "continue with it.", 
    "So let me differentiate by parts again, and start with", 
    "the e raised to minus alpha t term.", 
    "So I get CK2.", 
    "So I have the minus from the alpha term here.", 
    "So I get alpha e raised to minus alpha t, and I", 
    "get sine omega dt.", 
    "And then I can differentiate with respect to sine, and", 
    "here's what I get.", 
    "Writing that down, I get--", 
    "it's a plus now--", 
    "K2, I'm differentiating the sine component, minus alpha t,", 
    "and I get omega d cosine omega dt.", 
    "A bit messy, but not too bad.", 
    "So now I can go ahead and I know i of t is 0, so", 
    "I write down 0.", 
    "And find out the expression on the right side, find out its", 
    "value for t equals 0.", 
    "So for t equals 0, the sine term goes away, the", 
    "sine term goes away.", 
    "The cosine terms, the cosines become 1.", 
    "e raised to alphas become 1.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And I can also cancel out the C's, because the left", 
    "hand side is 0.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "I get minus K1 alpha.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So the C's cancel out as well.", 
    "So I get the minus K1 alpha.", 
    "And up here I get K2, and there's an", 
    "omega d there as well.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "So I get minus K1 alpha plus K2 omega d must be equal to 0.", 
    "Oh, I just noticed a little typo here, there should have", 
    "been a C in there.", 
    "I hope I haven't made any other little", 
    "mistakes like that.", 
    "So based on this, I can determine--", 
    "so here, up here, I can easily say that K1 is", 
    "simply minus VI.", 
    "And then, down here, I can write down that K2 is now", 
    "equal to a function of K1.", 
    "And I can write that down as K1 alpha divided by omega d .", 
    "And I know that K1 is minus VI.", 
    "So I get minus VI alpha by omega d.", 
    "So thus I have K1, and now I have K2.", 
    "Let me put a couple of stars there to indicate that we have", 
    "the two constants that we were looking for.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So now I have both K1 and K2.", 
    "So given that, I'm ready to write down my final", 
    "expression.", 
    "So v t is simply VI, and since K1 is minus VI, I write down", 
    "minus VI e raised to minus alpha t cosine of omega dt.", 
    "And then K2 is minus VI alpha by omega d.", 
    "And I write e raised to minus alpha t sine omega dt.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Let me just do a very quick sanity check here, just make", 
    "sure that I have not made some silly mistakes along the way.", 
    "Let me just double check to see if I get the same answer", 
    "for the case where R is zero.", 
    "So check.", 
    "Let's do a quick check here for R equals", 
    "zero, what do we get?", 
    "For R equals 0, we know that alpha equals zero.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And we also know that if alpha is 0, then omega d must be", 
    "omega naught.", 
    "Because alpha is 0, then omega d is square root of omega", 
    "naught squared minus alpha squared.", 
    "So omega d will be equal to omega naught.", 
    "So in that situation, v of t will be the VI minus VI e", 
    "raised to minus alpha t goes to 1.", 
    "And so I end up with cosine of omega naught t, because omega", 
    "d is the same as omega naught here.", 
    "And then finally, I take a look at the last term.", 
    "And in this last term I have an alpha.", 
    "And since alpha is 0, this is what I get.", 
    "So this is indeed the right equation for an LC circuit.", 
    "Correct for LC circuit.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So at least for that little check, it appears that what I", 
    "have up here for v of t seems to be on the right track.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So it's correct for LC circuit based on setting r equals 0", 
    "which resulted in alpha being 0, and omega d being equal to", 
    "omega naught.", 
    "OK.", 
    "We're not quite done yet.", 
    "I want to simplify this even further.", 
    "I still don't quite see the decaying sinusoids along the", 
    "lines of what I had hoped for.", 
    "We're almost there.", 
    "Let's go ahead a little further."
