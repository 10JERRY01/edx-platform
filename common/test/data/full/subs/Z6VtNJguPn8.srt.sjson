    "SPEAKER 1: I hope you enjoyed the fun demo and how the", 
    "choice of bias point affects the gain and the kind of swing", 
    "you can get and distortion at the boundaries of the", 
    "saturation region.", 
    "We are now ready to jump into the small signal circuit view.", 
    "So most recently, you looked at what the mathematical", 
    "approach to small signal circuits were and the", 
    "graphical approach.", 
    "We are now ready to revisit the small signal circuit.", 
    "So recall in the small signal circuit view, we can derive", 
    "small signal equivalent models for our elements, and then we", 
    "can use those elements to build small signal circuits", 
    "and conduct small signal analysis directly on those", 
    "small signal circuits.", 
    "We can cut down on the math we have to do and instead build", 
    "little circuits, and then directly analyze", 
    "those little circuits.", 
    "And I'm going to use as an example an amplifier and do", 
    "this analysis for you.", 
    "OK, so let me start with a large signal model for our", 
    "amplifier, and then show you that I can build a small", 
    "signal circuit equivalent for it and directly analyze it.", 
    "So for my amplifier here, let me go ahead and build a large", 
    "signal circuit for it.", 
    "So I need a voltage source here, vI.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "And then I'm going to replace my MOSFET with a dependent", 
    "source, a voltage-controlled current source.", 
    "And its current iD is related to the MOSFET parameters k", 
    "over 2 vI minus VT, all squared.", 
    "So I've done this so far.", 
    "So then, I go up.", 
    "I take a v0 out here.", 
    "And then I go and I have a resistor RL.", 
    "And then, that resistor RL is connected to a supply, which", 
    "in turn goes to ground.", 
    "And my supply is given by VS", 
    "Right, so this is my large signal model for the amplifier", 
    "where I've replaced the physical devices with their", 
    "equivalent circuit models like the dependent current source", 
    "for the MOSFET.", 
    "All right, so my next step will be to do the following.", 
    "So I'm going to show you that we can replace large signal", 
    "element models with small signal element models in the", 
    "same circuit topology.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So for example, in this large signal circuit--", 
    "you've seen this before as well-- you can replace these", 
    "large signal elements with their small signal", 
    "equivalents, each of these.", 
    "And then, we can go ahead and analyze the resulting small", 
    "signal circuit.", 
    "I want to go ahe and show you the method first. I want to", 
    "show the method operationally, and then I'm going to go and", 
    "do an example for you.", 
    "And then, towards the end of this sequence, I'm going to", 
    "spend some time and give you the foundations, the", 
    "theoretical foundations as to why it was possible to replace", 
    "large signal element models with their small signal", 
    "equivalents using the same circuit topology in order to", 
    "get the small signal result.", 
    "And if you're impatient and want to jump ahead, feel free", 
    "to go and look at section 8..2.1 of the textbook.", 
    "All right?", 
    "Let's dive right in.", 
    "So the small signal circuit analysis method has the", 
    "following steps.", 
    "There are three steps.", 
    "The first step is to go and find the operating point of", 
    "the circuit using DC analysis.", 
    "Use your DC bias inputs, and use a large signal model, and", 
    "find out the operating point for your circuit.", 
    "In our case, this would involve applying an input VI", 
    "and finding the corresponding input V0.", 
    "And as part of this, we could also find the bias current", 
    "through the output to the MOSFET.", 
    "As a second step, we will develop small signal models", 
    "for each of the elements.", 
    "So we will create small single linearized models for each of", 
    "the elements of the large signal circuit", 
    "as our second step.", 
    "The first step will be to replace each of the large", 
    "signal elements, OK?", 
    "So the original circuit has a bunch of", 
    "large signal elements.", 
    "We will replace each of those large signal elements with", 
    "their small signal models, and what will result is the small", 
    "signal circuit.", 
    "The small signal circuit will result", 
    "And once you have the small signal circuit, we can then go", 
    "ahead and analyze that small signal circuit.", 
    "And the key here is that we can use some of the bazookas", 
    "in our tool chest like Tool Proposition and other", 
    "techniques to analyze the resulting linearized circuit."
