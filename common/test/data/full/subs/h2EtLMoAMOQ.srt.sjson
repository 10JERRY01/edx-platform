    "SPEAKER: So before we get into selectivity, I want to show", 
    "you something extremely, extremely interesting.", 
    "Think of this as your next aha moment.", 
    "I'm going to show you a way in which I can use this little", 
    "circuit here, this RLC circuit, in a way that gives", 
    "me voltage values that are much higher than voltage", 
    "values that are input.", 
    "So far, almost all the circuits we've seen tend to", 
    "attenuate voltage values.", 
    "If I have some input voltage, the voltage values at", 
    "intermediate points of the circuit are generally the same", 
    "or lower than the input voltage.", 
    "However, I'm going to show you some really cool stuff in this", 
    "video where I'm going to show you how you can accomplish and", 
    "achieve a much higher voltage amplitudes than are input to", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "Let's start with something that we know about, and start", 
    "the no surprises.", 
    "Let's say I have an RLC circuit where I input a", 
    "sinusoid with amplitude Vi, where this simply says that my", 
    "input is Vi cosine omega t.", 
    "And I simply represent in the circuit the real part of that", 
    "input signal.", 
    "Let us say that in this case I observe Vc, the voltage across", 
    "the capacitor.", 
    "Let's see how this is extremely, extremely", 
    "interesting.", 
    "I'm going to start by plotting intuitively the frequency", 
    "response at Vc.", 
    "So I'll just do it intuitively.", 
    "So let's look at Vc divide by Vi.", 
    "And let's take the magnitude of that.", 
    "So let's use our usual trick and first plot it intuitively.", 
    "And then we can write the math for that.", 
    "So intuitively, notice that I'll look at lower frequencies", 
    "and high omega.", 
    "So at low omega, we know that the capacitor behaves like an", 
    "open circuit.", 
    "So for low frequencies almost the entire input frequency", 
    "will drop across the capacitor.", 
    "And so therefore, my function will have a 1 for very low", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "Almost all the input will drop across the capacitor.", 
    "OK, that's easy enough.", 
    "What about high frequencies?", 
    "Well, at high frequencies, the capacitor is short to high", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "The capacitor is short to high frequencies.", 
    "Then I'm going to get a very low", 
    "response across the capacitor.", 
    "So very high frequencies, I'm going to get a low response.", 
    "So c is short to high frequencies.", 
    "And c is open to low frequencies.", 
    "We know that.", 
    "And then, for intermediate values, we also know that it's", 
    "going to look something like this-- we think.", 
    "We don't quite know, but we think.", 
    "I can also plot the value at omega 0.", 
    "I can go figure out what the value is.", 
    "And let's say this is where omega 0 here.", 
    "Here something very interesting is going to", 
    "happen, so I just told you hold onto your", 
    "pencils for a minute.", 
    "I can do the math here and I get Vc over Vi using the", 
    "voltage divider relation.", 
    "I can write the impedance of the capacitor and divide it by", 
    "the sum of all of the other impedance.", 
    "So this will be j omega c.", 
    "So voltage of the capacitor divided by the input voltage", 
    "will be impedance of the capacitor divided by impedance", 
    "of the inductor plus the impedance across the", 
    "capacitor-- or impedance of the capacitor.", 
    "Plus the impedance of the resistor, which is R.", 
    "As is the usual practice, I'll simplify it by multiplying it", 
    "out by j omega c.", 
    "And that will give us 1 divided by.", 
    "So j omega c times 1 divided by j omega c is a 1.", 
    "And then j omega l times j omega c will give me minus", 
    "omega squared LC.", 
    "Minus omega squared LC.", 
    "And then I get j omega C times R simply gives me j omega RC.", 
    "I can take the magnitude of the transfer", 
    "function Vc over Vi.", 
    "And the magnitude is simply given by--", 
    "I get a 1 there.", 
    "And for the magnitude, I simply get the square of the", 
    "real part plus the square of the", 
    "imaginary part square rooted.", 
    "So I get the sum of the square of the real part plus the", 
    "square of the imaginary part square rooted.", 
    "So the square of the real part is omega squared LC, whole", 
    "thing squared.", 
    "And the square of the imaginary part is simply omega", 
    "RC all squared.", 
    "So that is the magnitude of the transfer function for", 
    "something like this.", 
    "So what I'm going to do next is stare at this for a little", 
    "while longer.", 
    "You've taken it on faith from me that between these two", 
    "points the function looks like this.", 
    "I'll tell you right now, I am kind of lying.", 
    "It's not exactly that.", 
    "This is going to blow your mind when I show you what's", 
    "really going on there.", 
    "So let's go right on to it.", 
    "So here again, I have my RLC circuit, and I'm", 
    "looking at Vc over Vi.", 
    "So I showed you earlier that--- let me just plot the", 
    "graph as I've plotted so far.", 
    "So this is Vc over Vi.", 
    "Vc.", 
    "And I've shown you that I think it looks like this.", 
    "We plotted the low frequencies for the", 
    "voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "And then I said that, well, I think it's going", 
    "to look like this.", 
    "c was open to low frequencies here and c was short high", 
    "frequencies here.", 
    "And so I said that omega 0 was somewhere here.", 
    "And I expected it to look kind of like this.", 
    "Now let's have some fun.", 
    "Let us see what is going on.", 
    "So before I go into that, let me write down a couple of", 
    "things that you've seen before.", 
    "So you know that omega 0 is 1 divided by square root of LC.", 
    "And you also remember for the series RLC circuit--", 
    "I hope you remember--", 
    "that there was another parameter, 2 alpha.", 
    "And 2 alpha was R divided by L.", 
    "Here recall when we did time domain series RLC circuits,", 
    "when we looked at the characteristic equation, and", 
    "we equated terms. We denoted R divided by L by 2 alpha.", 
    "And omega 0 was 1 by square root of LC.", 
    "We're going to see this pop up again."
