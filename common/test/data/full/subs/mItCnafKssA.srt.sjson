    "SPEAKER 1: The various methods\nI&#39;m going to show you, in", 
    "particular method one and\nmethod two for solving", 
    "non-linear equations, are really\njust particular ways of", 
    "solving a pair of equations,\nat least one of which have", 
    "some non-linearity to them.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with the\ngraphical method.", 
    "And my circuit is on the\nright hand side.", 
    "And I&#39;m showing you the same\nvoltage source resister", 
    "determinant pattern connected\nto the device D. And below", 
    "know that, I have the equation\niD equals ae raised to bvD,", 
    "which is the device equation.", 
    "So as before, let me\ngo ahead and do all", 
    "the first few steps.", 
    "I go and write the node\nequation at VD.", 
    "And I got that.", 
    "I go ahead and substitute, as\nI always do in the node", 
    "method, for the current\nusing device relation.", 
    "And just for fun here, let me\nkeep that separate for now.", 
    "In the analytical method, notice\nthat you ended up with", 
    "these two equations, and\nyou had to solve", 
    "for these two unknowns.", 
    "And we did that using\nanalytical methods.", 
    "In this video, I&#39;m going to\nsolve these using the", 
    "graphical method.", 
    "In order to do so, here&#39;s\nwhat I&#39;m gonna do.", 
    "I&#39;m gonna start by rearranging\nthe terms in my equation one", 
    "to make it a little bit more\nconvenient to draw the graph.", 
    "So notice in equation two, I\nhave iD equals something.", 
    "And then I have an expression\nin VD and iD.", 
    "So what I&#39;d like to do is let\nme start by taking this", 
    "equation here and expressing it\nin more of a standard form", 
    "so I can get something symmetric\nto equation two.", 
    "So let me express this by\npulling iD to the left hand", 
    "side all by itself.", 
    "And so I get something\nlike this.", 
    "So I get iD on the\nleft hand side.", 
    "And then I&#39;m gonna move VD minus\nV divided by R to the", 
    "right hand side.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with minus V\ndivided by R. And when I move", 
    "that to the right hand side,\nit becomes V divided by R.", 
    "And then when I move VD over R\nto the right hand side, I get", 
    "minus VD over R. And I&#39;ve simply\nnot done much here.", 
    "I just have done some\nrearranging all of the terms", 
    "in equation one.", 
    "And since I haven&#39;t done\nanything unique and different,", 
    "I&#39;m just going to label\nthis as one prime.", 
    "So I just got this from equation\none, and I just", 
    "labelled that as one prime.", 
    "Well, continuing with the\nmethod, now I&#39;m summarizing", 
    "for you equations one\nprime and two.", 
    "We want both of them for iD on\nthe left hand side expressed", 
    "as a function of VD.", 
    "And in equation two,\nit is non-linear.", 
    "So the graphical method can\nbe summarized as follows.", 
    "To start, I want you to\nnotice something.", 
    "Essentially all we&#39;re trying to\ndo is find a solution, find", 
    "a value for VD and iD that\nsatisfies both equations one", 
    "prime and two.", 
    "That&#39;s all we&#39;re trying to do.", 
    "It&#39;s just math here.", 
    "There&#39;s no circuits here.", 
    "We&#39;re just doing some relatively\nsimple math.", 
    "We just have to figure out what\niD and VD are, and we&#39;ll", 
    "use the graphical method.", 
    "So to do the graphical method,\nwhat I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m", 
    "going to plot the two equations\nin a pair of graphs.", 
    "And let me first start by\nplotting equation two.", 
    "And in equation two,\nI&#39;m gonna plot iD", 
    "equals a raised to aebvd.", 
    "I&#39;m going to plot iD equals\na times e raised to b VD.", 
    "That&#39;s my equation two.", 
    "And this is the plot\nthat I get for it.", 
    "It&#39;s a plot that I had before.", 
    "And so that&#39;s my equation two.", 
    "Notice that this plot here is\nsimply the constraint on iD", 
    "and VD imposed by the device.", 
    "I have this little circuit here\ncontaining the Thevenin", 
    "equivalent and connected\nto the device.", 
    "Equation two is simply\nthe constraint", 
    "imposed by the device.", 
    "The device properties are such\nthat it is going to constrain", 
    "iD and VD into some\nrelationship.", 
    "This constraint that I&#39;ve\nplotted here as equation two", 
    "is simply the constraint\nimposed by this device.", 
    "Next, let me go to one prime.", 
    "And in one prime, let\nme go ahead and plot", 
    "the one prime equation.", 
    "And that equation--", 
    "so we write that here-- is V\ndivided by R minus VD divided", 
    "by R.", 
    "So I&#39;m just going to plot\nthat equation for", 
    "you in a second graph.", 
    "So how do I plot this?", 
    "So notice here, when VD is 0,\nwell then, iD is V divided R.", 
    "So that is one point on\nthe straight line.", 
    "Notice that this is an equation\nfor a straight line.", 
    "It&#39;s a linear relationship\nbetween iD and VD.", 
    "Next, when iD is 0--\nso when iD is 0--", 
    "then notice that R and R can be\ncanceled out and V will be", 
    "equal to VD.", 
    "So when iD is 0, V\nand VD are equal.", 
    "So therefore, VD equals V. So\nthis is the line when iD is 0.", 
    "And for that, VD equals V. So\nthen I get this straight line", 
    "for the relationship\nbetween VD and iD", 
    "according to one prime.", 
    "So what&#39;s the slope\nof this line here?", 
    "Can you tell me what the\nslope of this line is?", 
    "Let me give you a few seconds\nto think about it.", 
    null, 
    "From the equation one prime,\nfrom this equation, the slope", 
    "is simply given by the\ncoefficient of VD since the", 
    "slope is negative, which is why\nthe line is inclined the", 
    "following way.", 
    "So the slope here is simply\nminus 1 divided by R. So that", 
    "is my constraint that\nrelates VD to iD.", 
    "And where did that constrain\ncome from?", 
    "That constraint is the\nconstraint on iD and VD that", 
    "has been imposed by the\nrest of the circuit.", 
    "So if the first constraint was\nimposed by the device, then", 
    "the second constraint is\nimposed by the Thevenin", 
    "equivalent that is connected\nto the device.", 
    "The Thevenin equivalent was\nthe V and R in series, and", 
    "those two impose a Thevenin\nconstraint on the terminal", 
    "pair that relates\nto VD and iD.", 
    "So now my next step is given\nthese two graphs", 
    "for iD versus VD--", 
    "and clearly, those are\nmy two constraints.", 
    "Graph two says that iD and VD\nmust be somewhere on this", 
    "trajectory.", 
    "Graph one prime says, well, I&#39;m\nnot going to let V, D, and", 
    "iD be anywhere else\nbut on this curve.", 
    "That&#39;s it.", 
    "Both of them are fighting with\neach other and telling each", 
    "other, nope.", 
    "I&#39;m not going to allow\nyou to do anything.", 
    "You have to be on my curve.", 
    "So in this case, I have two\ncurves, and I need a point", 
    "that satisfies both curves.", 
    "And that is easy enough to do.", 
    "And I simply have to go\nand satisfy both these", 
    "constraints, and that will\ngive me the answer", 
    "for VD versus iD.", 
    "Before I do that, so I can go\nand solve it for you, let me", 
    "go and pick some values for\nthe various parameters.", 
    "So as before, I&#39;m going to pick\nV equals 1 volt, R equals", 
    "1 Ohm, a quarter of an amp, and\nb to be one volt inverse.", 
    "So I&#39;ll pick the same parameters\nas I had done when", 
    "I did the analytical method.", 
    "Next what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll\nsubstitute these parameters", 
    "into the two equations, one\nprime and two, and rewrite", 
    "them with the parameters\nsubstitute.", 
    "So for one prime, I get iD.", 
    "Since V is 1 and R is 1 1, I get\nV divided by R equals 1.", 
    "And then since R is\n1, I get minus VD.", 
    "So this is one prime once I&#39;ve\nsubstituted the values.", 
    "And then for equation\ntwo, what do I get?", 
    "I get iD equals ae\nraised to bVD.", 
    "a is 1/4, so I write\nthat down.", 
    "b is 1.", 
    "And so I get VD up here.", 
    "So I have my two equations\nin terms of the", 
    "parameters I have chosen.", 
    "And now I can go ahead and plot\ntwo equations and see", 
    "where they intersect.", 
    "I&#39;ve given you the form\nof the graph here.", 
    "And so let me go ahead\nand plot this.", 
    "Let me go ahead and\nplot two, first.", 
    "Two looks like this where\nthis point is 1/4.", 
    "That was the a point.", 
    "As I said before, this curve\nis simply my equation two.", 
    "Then let me go ahead and plot\nequation one prime.", 
    "And as you recall, that looked\nsomething like this, where the", 
    "VD-intercept was V and the\ny-intercept was given by V", 
    "divided by R. And in this case\nit was 1, and V was also 1.", 
    "So those are my two curves,\nand here&#39;s the intercept.", 
    "Right here is the point where\nthe two coincide.", 
    "And then I just have to go and\nfind the values of iD and VD", 
    "where they do intersect.", 
    "So at this point, it\nwill be 0.56 volts.", 
    "And this point will\nbe 0.44 amps.", 
    "It&#39;s the same as what\nI calculated in", 
    "the analytical method.", 
    "And so let me go ahead\nand write that down.", 
    "iD equals, in this\ncase, 0.44 amps.", 
    "And VD equals 0.56 volts.", 
    "So basically, I&#39;ve just\ntaken the two graphs,", 
    "superimposed them.", 
    "This was one prime, and\nthe non-linear one was", 
    "[UNINTELLIGIBLE] equation two.", 
    "So before I jump off to one\nother thing to define", 
    "something for you, notice\nthis curve here.", 
    "This is a straight line that\nreflects the Thevenin", 
    "constraint that I apply on\nmy non-linear device.", 
    "And I mentioned earlier, we&#39;re\ngonna do this again, and", 
    "again, and again.", 
    "I think you will see this at\nleast 10 more times in this", 
    "course where I take a Thevenin\nequivalent of the following", 
    "form, sum voltage, V, sum R,\nand apply that in series", 
    "across something interesting.", 
    "And so this line that I see here\nis the constraint imposed", 
    "by the Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "And you can see that from\nequation one prime.", 
    "Now, so there&#39;s a name\nfor this line.", 
    "So this line is called\nthe load line.", 
    "You will see more reasons\nfor this later.", 
    "But that this line is called\nthe load line.", 
    "Let me show you one other little\ntrick just in case you", 
    "didn&#39;t completely get how I\nsolved the graphical method.", 
    "But one little trick here--", 
    "if you like PowerPoint,\nyou will enjoy this.", 
    "And if you don&#39;t like\nPowerPoint, you", 
    "will hate me for it.", 
    "So if you look at these\ncurves, I have my two", 
    "equations in iD, one\nprime and two.", 
    "And I&#39;ve plotted them\nfor you here.", 
    "On the left hand side, I&#39;ve\nplotted equation two, right", 
    "hand side I&#39;ve plotted\nequation one.", 
    "And fundamentally, all that the\ngraphical method is doing", 
    "is simply superimposing\nthe two graphs.", 
    "And by superimposing the two\ngraphs, it is finding the", 
    "point where the two\npoints intersect.", 
    "And this is what you get.", 
    "So let me do that again.", 
    "So I pick up one of the curves\nand superimpose it on top of", 
    "the other curve, given the same\naxes and the same scale", 
    "for the axes.", 
    "And then I go ahead and find\nthe solution for the point", 
    "where the two intersect.",
