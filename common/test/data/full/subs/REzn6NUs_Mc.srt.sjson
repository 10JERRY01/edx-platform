    "SPEAKER 1: So let me start with the second step of my", 
    "solution, which is to find the particular solution of vp.", 
    "So here is my differential equation.", 
    "And notice that we're still struggling down the", 
    "differential equation hard path.", 
    "And in this case, I need to find vp, which is my", 
    "particular solution to my input vi cosine omega t.", 
    "So let me write down my particular equation, RC dvp by", 
    "dt, where vp is my solution for the input, which is any", 
    "solution to the input vi cosine omega t.", 
    "So vp equals vi cosine omega t.", 
    "So any solution vp that's satisfies this", 
    "equation will suffice.", 
    "So notice that differential equations are easy because all", 
    "you have to do is start guessing.", 
    "Well, let's start guessing at what the solution might be.", 
    "So first try, what shall we guess?", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "Why don't we guess vp equals, hey, A, some constant A. So if", 
    "I stick some constant A here, then I get A out there.", 
    "Here I get zero.", 
    "So I end up with A equals vi cosine omega t.", 
    "So that does not work, nope.", 
    "No, no, no, that doesn't work.", 
    "Well, let's try something else.", 
    "After all, we're going to keep guessing and trying.", 
    "And let's try something else.", 
    "So what do you think?", 
    "Well, there's a cosine on the right hand side.", 
    "So let me try something like A cosine omega t.", 
    "Now, this might have a better hope of", 
    "working, another guess.", 
    "All right, so if I plug in A cosine omega t into here, I", 
    "get A cosine omega t.", 
    "That's not bad.", 
    "That looks pretty reasonable.", 
    "There's a cosine omega t on the right hand side.", 
    "And I have a cosine omega t on the left hand side.", 
    "Ah, interesting.", 
    "But let me stick a cosine omega t here.", 
    "And I end up with sine omega t.", 
    "Because when I differentiate the cosine, I get a sine.", 
    "So I end up with something sine omega t plus something", 
    "cosine omega t equals something cosine omega t.", 
    "So that doesn't work either.", 
    "I cannot make that work.", 
    "So that was a failed attempt again.", 
    "All right.", 
    "All right, let's see.", 
    "Let's try a third time.", 
    "Let's pick something else.", 
    "Why don't we pick, let's try A cosine of omega t", 
    "with some phase phi.", 
    "So in this case A is the amplitude of the cosine.", 
    "Omega is the frequency of the sinusoid.", 
    "And phi is the phase of my supposed assumption, my", 
    "supposed output vp.", 
    "So let's see if this one works.", 
    "This looks pretty reasonable.", 
    "So let's stick it in there and see if I can make it work.", 
    "So I want to write down so this must equal vi of", 
    "cosine omega t.", 
    "So I get RC dvp dt plus vp.", 
    "So vp is A cosine of omega t plus phi.", 
    "So I write that down.", 
    "And then I have to write down dvp dt times RC.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "So let's see.", 
    "I get a RC.", 
    "What is dvp dt, where vp is A cosine of omega t plus phi?", 
    "So if I differentiate it, I get a minus.", 
    "I get an omega out here.", 
    "And I get an A. And I get a sine omega t plus phi.", 
    "So I get RC A omega sine omega t plus phi plus A cosine", 
    "[? related to ?]", 
    "phi equals vi cosine omega t.", 
    "I'm not sure where I'm going with this.", 
    "But let me blundle along for a little bit longer.", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "So in order to solve this thing, I could equate cosine", 
    "omega t terms and sine omega t terms. So let me see if I can", 
    "expand out sine omega t plus phi and cosine omega t plus", 
    "phi so that I end up with sine omega t and cosine omega t in", 
    "pristine form without the phase inside them.", 
    "All right, let's try that.", 
    "Let's start with the sine omega t plus phi.", 
    "So I get RC omega A sine omega t plus phi.", 
    "So if I distribute that, I get sine omega t cosine phi and", 
    "then minus RC omega A cosine omega t plus phi, I'm sorry,", 
    "cosine omega t plus cosine phi, oops, I'm sorry.", 
    "Let me just get this straight here.", 
    "So I got a sine omega t cosine phi cosine omega t.", 
    "Then I should get a sine phi.", 
    "As you can see this is getting to be more and more of a mess.", 
    "And you'll recall I got that from the usual trig equations.", 
    "Sine A plus B is given by sine A cosine B plus cosine A sine", 
    "B. You can see this in the appendix in the textbook if", 
    "you're looking for a primer on trig.", 
    "Then let me work on the second thing here.", 
    "So for the second thing I need to distribute cosine", 
    "omega t plus phi.", 
    "And that is cosine of A plus B is cosine A cosine B minus", 
    "sine A sine B. Let me write that down.", 
    "So it's A cosine omega t cosine phi minus A sine omega", 
    "t sine phi.", 
    "And the whole thing is equal to vi cosine omega t.", 
    "Oh my goodness, all right.", 
    "What do we have here?", 
    "So notice here that I have some sine omega t terms. I", 
    "have some cosine omega t terms. So what I could do is I", 
    "could equate the coefficients of sine omega t.", 
    "And since there's no sine omega t here, I", 
    "could set them to zero.", 
    "And then I could equate the coefficients of cosine of", 
    "omega t to vi.", 
    "And I can go ahead and solve this.", 
    "So I will leave that as an exercise for the reader.", 
    "But this is a mess.", 
    "So I am tired of this nonsense.", 
    "This is not a path that I want to take.", 
    "It's a mess.", 
    "So trust me.", 
    "This works.", 
    "This will work if you were to plow through it.", 
    "But I get into a trig nightmare situation.", 
    "I can make it work.", 
    "But it's a nightmare.", 
    "So let me scratch that out some more.", 
    "It is painful.", 
    "So we need to strike out in some other direction.", 
    "And this is too painful, not worth pursuing.", 
    "So let me pause there, take a little breather, and then take", 
    "a few deep breaths, and try to figure out what on Earth I'm", 
    "going to do.", 
    "Because this is just way too hard."
