    "SPEAKER 1: Before I go and do some examples, let me pause", 
    "and quickly summarize what we've seen so far.", 
    "And collect together in the next few minutes some of the", 
    "key notation and other principles that we've learned.", 
    "Let's start with the notation.", 
    "You've noticed that I have very quietly introduced a new", 
    "kind of notation.", 
    "This new notation involves big letters with small subscripts", 
    "of this sort.", 
    "So you recall the complex amplitude, this very special", 
    "complex amplitude--", 
    "big V small p.", 
    "These are all an example of a special notation that we've", 
    "introduced.", 
    "So this is a good time as any to sit down and take a quick", 
    "look at the various notations we have right now in the", 
    "course, and cast them in the right perspective.", 
    "So we've really looked at four different forms of notation.", 
    "And let me give you examples of these.", 
    "We've looked at things that look like this--", 
    "capital V capital A. We've looked at small v capital A", 
    "kinds of notations.", 
    "We've looked at small v small a.", 
    "And then most recently, we've looked at this new thing,", 
    "capital V small p, or capital V small a.", 
    "In fact, just to be consistent, let me go ahead", 
    "and write it down as capital V small a.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So in terms of notation and describing what these mean,", 
    "capital V capital a, and similar things--", 
    "uppercase symbols with uppercase subscripts--", 
    "are DC or operating point variables.", 
    "So let's write that down.", 
    "OK, these are DC or operating point variables.", 
    "All right?", 
    "And then we also looked at lowercase variables and", 
    "lowercase symbols with uppercase", 
    "subscripts, such as vA.", 
    "So in this case, these were our total", 
    "instantaneous variables.", 
    "Total instantaneous variables.", 
    "So notice that these were lowercase symbols with", 
    "uppercase subscripts.", 
    "Then we had lower case symbols with lowercase subscripts, and", 
    "these were our incremental instantaneous variables.", 
    "Or small signal instantaneous variables.", 
    "And then most recently, I snuck this", 
    "new notation at you.", 
    "And this was uppercase symbols with lowercase subscripts.", 
    "And these reflected complex amplitudes.", 
    "Complex amplitudes.", 
    "Notice that these could be complex amplitudes of either", 
    "total variables or incremental components.", 
    "All right?", 
    "So this could be the complex amplitudes of either the total", 
    "variable or incremental variables.", 
    "We don't make a distinction between those two.", 
    "And in fact, very commonly, what we end up having is a DC", 
    "offset with a small signal variation.", 
    "And that small signal variation is very commonly a", 
    "repeating signal, like a music signal, or a sinusoid, or", 
    "something like that.", 
    "So very commonly, these incremental variables are", 
    "represented as complex amplitudes when the deal with", 
    "sinusoids as well.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So this is a quick summary of notation.", 
    "Notice also that things like Va and so on also represent", 
    "real amplitudes of sinusoidal input sources.", 
    "So recall things like Vi cosine omega t, and things", 
    "like that, they also represent real amplitudes of sinusoidal", 
    "input sources.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So that's a quick summary of signal notation.", 
    "And with these four items, we've covered the four", 
    "possible combinations of uppercase and lowercase for", 
    "either the symbol or its subscript.", 
    "Next, let me go ahead and summarize the", 
    "impedance method for you.", 
    "You can find both a summary of the signal notation and the", 
    "summary of the impedance method on", 
    "page 716 of the textbook.", 
    "Now in general, I really encourage you to go and look", 
    "up the textbook, not just for the content as part of the", 
    "lectures, but there's also sprinkled throughout the", 
    "textbook a huge number of solved examples, along with", 
    "the material that we cover.", 
    "So I really, really encourage you to make it a habit to go", 
    "back to the textbook and take a look at a lot", 
    "of the solved examples.", 
    "And they oftentimes form a nice bridge between the", 
    "examples that we solve in lecture and in exercises and", 
    "the examples in places like homeworks and the laboratory.", 
    "So the impedance method has four steps.", 
    "Let's write down one, two, three, and four.", 
    "In the first step in the impedance method--", 
    "and recall in this method we are looking for the sinusoidal", 
    "steady state.", 
    "So in these cases, we are going to be using sinusoidal", 
    "sources, so as a first step we replace the sinusoidal sources", 
    "by their complex or real amplitudes.", 
    "So let's start with that.", 
    "For example, if you have something like Vi cosine omega", 
    "t as an input, then this would be replaced by simply capital", 
    "V small i as a subscript in the circuit model.", 
    "So we just deal with the real amplitudes of the sinusoidal", 
    "sources, or the complex amplitudes of either the", 
    "sources or the intermediate values.", 
    "As a second step, we replace circuit elements by boxes.", 
    "These boxes are the impedance boxes, or impedances.", 
    "So for example, we replace Rs with R boxes.", 
    "We replace inductor's L with inductance boxes--", 
    "with inductance LS boxes.", 
    "And Cs with the 1 by sC boxes.", 
    "These are the impedances.", 
    "Now here, S equals j omega, as usual.", 
    "And really, the circuit topology stays the same.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And so, let me make a note of that, too.", 
    "Circuit topology says the same.", 
    "And this is called the impedance", 
    "model of the network.", 
    "Let me make just a little bit more room for myself here.", 
    "And let me write down three here, and then I'll go down to", 
    "four a little later.", 
    "You will also notice that as I do some", 
    "examples, I may often--", 
    "in step number two, I may often skip the step of", 
    "actually drawing out a special circuit.", 
    "In other words, if I have an inductor, I'm suggesting that", 
    "we draw a new circuit with something like this.", 
    "But oftentimes, as you get more and more practice, you", 
    "may simply skip the second step and simply", 
    "leave it like this.", 
    "And when you do the analysis, wherever you have an L, you go", 
    "and use an sL.", 
    "But for the method is concerned, this is true.", 
    "Once you have the impedance model of the circuit, then you", 
    "simply use an algebraic analysis and all your usual", 
    "techniques, like the node method, the Thevenin method,", 
    "the intuitive method based on series parallel", 
    "simplifications, or the superposition method.", 
    "And go ahead and figure out the various complex amplitudes", 
    "that you care about.", 
    "So let's go and write that down.", 
    "And the third step, you go and determine the complex", 
    "amplitudes of the voltages and currents at the various node", 
    "points and the branches.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So that's the third step where you go ahead and figure out", 
    "the complex amplitudes of the intermediate points in the", 
    "circuit and the various responses as a", 
    "function of the frequency.", 
    "Now, the fourth step is not usually necessary.", 
    "Let me just write that-- not usually needed.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And here, what you try to do is obtain the time variables", 
    "from the complex amplitudes.", 
    "Time variables from complex amplitudes.", 
    "And the way you do that is, if you have a complex amplitude,", 
    "say Va at some point, then the time variable, vA, the total", 
    "time variable, for instance, will look something like Va", 
    "cosine of omega t plus angle Va.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So this is your quick summary of the impedance method.", 
    "And I really encourage you to go and look at", 
    "page 716 of the textbook.", 
    "And surrounding that, and other areas of the textbook,", 
    "you will also find lots of examples.", 
    "This is a place where I think getting a lot of practice with", 
    "this impedance model is a good idea.", 
    "And you will see lots and lots of little examples that have", 
    "been worked out in the textbook.", 
    "So I encourage you to go look at these examples and try to", 
    "work them out for yourselves."
