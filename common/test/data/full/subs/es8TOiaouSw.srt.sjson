    "OK, so those are our gates.", 
    "So these are primitive elements,\nwhich can be used to", 
    "build bigger circuits.",

    "As I promised you, this stuff\nis absolutely fun, and it&#39;s", 
    "extremely easy.", 
    "So let&#39;s say, for example, I\nwant to implement a digital", 
    "circuit that implements\nthis Boolean equation.", 
    "OK, I want to build a circuit\nthat implements A plus the", 
    "inversion of B dot C.",

    "OK, so the inversion here\nis also called a bar.",

    "So let&#39;s start with the\ninnermost expression here, B", 
    "dot C. So let me go ahead and\nhave B and have C. And that&#39;s", 
    "a and function.",

    "So I need an or gate.", 
    "OK, and so the other input of\nthe or gate is A. OK, so", 
    "here&#39;s my circuit.", 
    "So the output is a function of\nA, B, and C, and the output", 
    "circuit, and the circuit\nis shown here.", 
    "So B dot C bar becomes\nan and gate.", 
    "And the result is an OR with\nA. And there I get my",

    "OK, so so far, we have been\ndealing with Boolean values,",

    "And all our inputs have been\ndigital signals that can take", 
    "on either 0 or a 1 value.",

    "Processing of logical signals,\nwhere in logic, things can be", 
    "true or things can be false.",

    "How do I represent something\nlike 5 or 9,099, and", 
    "so on and so forth?", 
    "How do you represent much\nbigger numbers, so I can", 
    "process bigger signal values.", 
    "And clearly, computers\ndo that.", 
    "And so how do we do that?", 
    "So numbers larger than 1 can be\nrepresented using multiple", 
    "binary digits.", 
    "So just like you use the decimal\nnumber system and you", 
    "use decimal digits to represent\nnumbers greater than", 
    "9, I can use binary digits to\nrepresent numbers greater than", 
    "0 or 1 by concatenating\nthem into sequences.",

    "So in the decimal number system,\nlet&#39;s say I have the", 
    "number 921.", 
    "OK, 921 has a value.", 
    "And just to be clear, let me\nwrite that down as base 10.", 
    "So how do we compute\nthe value of this?", 
    "In our minds, how do we know\nhow big this number is?", 
    "The way we do that\nis as follows.", 
    "So we say 1 is in\nthe 0-th place.", 
    "2 is in the tens place and 9\nis in the hundreds place.", 
    "So we say the value of this is\nreally 9 times 10 squared",

    "Plus 2 times 10.", 
    "2 times 10 raised to 1.", 
    "That&#39;s a 10.",

    "That is the ones place.", 
    "OK, so that&#39;s ones place,\ntens place, hundreds", 
    "place and so on.", 
    "And so this is the\nvalue that I get.", 
    "Now, how do I do this in the\nbinary number system?", 
    "So let&#39;s try to find out what\nvalue 101 has in the binary", 
    "number system.", 
    "So 101, this has been written\nin the binary", 
    "system, or base 2.", 
    "And exactly like we did for\nthe decimal number system,", 
    "which was base 10, where we used\n10 raised to 0, 10 raised", 
    "to 1, 10 raised to\n2, and so on.", 
    "We&#39;ll do the exact same thing\nfor the binary system where", 
    "this is 0-th place.", 
    "I&#39;m sorry, this is going\nto be multiplied by 1.", 
    "This is going to be\nmultiplied by 2.", 
    "This is going to be multiplied\nby 2 squared, and so on and so", 
    "forth, to get the\nactual value.", 
    "So let&#39;s do that.", 
    "So I get the value of this is\n1 times 2 raised to 2 plus 0", 
    "times 2 raised to 1 plus\n1 times 2 raised to 0.", 
    "So this is the ones, the twos,\nthe fours place and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "And so if I compute the answer\nhere, 1 times 2 squared is 4.", 
    "And 1 times 1 is 1.", 
    "So 4 plus 1 is 5.", 
    "So the value of this represented\nin the base 10", 
    "system is 5.", 
    "So once we have these numbers\nthat are possibly", 
    "bigger than 1 and 1.", 
    "And/or for that matter, if you\nhave a whole bunch of logical", 
    "signals that we want to process,\nI can then go and", 
    "process and build various\nkinds of circuits.", 
    "So in this case, I can build\na 2-bit adder circuit.", 
    "So let&#39;s say I have a binary\nnumber represented by two", 
    "binary digits and another binary\nnumber represented by", 
    "two binary digits.", 
    "The circuit shown here\nis a adder circuit.", 
    "The adder circuit adds a pair\nof two binary digit numbers", 
    "and produces an answer.", 
    "So notice when I add\ntwo digits, I get", 
    "two digits of answer.",
