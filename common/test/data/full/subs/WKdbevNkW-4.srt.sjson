    "SPEAKER 1: In the last sequence, we learned about a", 
    "MOSFET as an interesting three-terminal device.", 
    "We modeled it as a switch with a resistance when it's on.", 
    "The switch is controlled by the voltage from the gate to", 
    "the source of the MOSFET.", 
    "We use that in the context of building an inverter which is", 
    "a thing that takes an input and puts out an output voltage", 
    "having a characteristic that looks like this.", 
    "This is the input voltage and this is the output voltage.", 
    "And we have a funny curve like that.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And as you go on, you'll see that this curve", 
    "actually ends up looking a little bit less funny, kind of", 
    "this S-shape curve.", 
    "But that doesn't matter.", 
    "What matters actually right now is that this is the first", 
    "device that you've seen that's nonlinear.", 
    "And what nonlinear means is that in different parts of", 
    "this curve, as you change the input voltage, the output", 
    "voltage changes by different amounts.", 
    "So as you change it over here, you make a little step, the", 
    "output changes hardly at all.", 
    "If you change the input over here, the", 
    "output changes a lot.", 
    "And again, as you change it over here, you change it a", 
    "little bit, it changes hardly at all.", 
    "So in the next sequence, we're going to look at more", 
    "nonlinear devices.", 
    "And specifically at two-terminal nonlinear devices", 
    "and how to understand them."
