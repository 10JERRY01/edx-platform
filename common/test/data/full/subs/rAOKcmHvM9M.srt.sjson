    "SPEAKER: Next, let me very quickly review for you this", 
    "whole thing about this peakiness, and how Q indicates", 
    "a peakiness.", 
    "And so you recall that if I take the response at Vc and", 
    "plot Vc, the magnitude of Vc over Vi, and I got the", 
    "low-pass filter.", 
    "That's omega 0 and this is 1 here.", 
    "And if I have a very high Q circuit, then", 
    "this is what I get.", 
    "This value is Q. Let me go ahead and quickly review the", 
    "analysis that we did for the circuit.", 
    "And I'll be dwelling on this a little bit more in the rest of", 
    "the sequence.", 
    "So let me go and do that for you.", 
    "And the way we analyze a circuit was we said, if I want", 
    "to get Vc or Vi, I simply did the usual voltage divider", 
    "action according to the impedance model.", 
    "And so Vc over Vi would simply be the impedance of the", 
    "capacitor, 1 by sC divided by the sum of the impedances in", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "So it was sL plus 1 by sC plus R.", 
    "And then, let's say I went and multiplied the", 
    "whole thing by sC.", 
    "I got sLC plus 1.", 
    "Plus sRC.", 
    "And then, let's say I substituted omega 0 for 1", 
    "divided by LC squared.", 
    "And let's say I also divided throughout by omega 0 squared.", 
    "So I did a couple things.", 
    "Replace LC, so omega 0 is 1 by square root of LC.", 
    "And let's say I divided both sides by omega 0.", 
    "Then what I would be left with--", 
    "I'm sorry, multiplied both sides by omega 0.", 
    "I would get omega 0 squared divided by s squared.", 
    "OK, so the LC would cancel out.", 
    "s squared times--", 
    "I get omega 0 squared here for 1.", 
    "And I would get s times R over L here.", 
    "Now then, if I--", 
    "we're very interesting to figure out what the response", 
    "would be at omega 0.", 
    "And so for omega equals omega 0, recalling that s is a", 
    "shorthand for j omega.", 
    "We showed that the magnitude of Vc over Vi was equal to Q.", 
    "Again, recall how we got that.", 
    "In the denominator of the function above, at s squared", 
    "and omega 0 squared, if s squared was--", 
    "so this is j squared omega 0 squared and", 
    "this is omega 0 squared.", 
    "And this is for omega equals omega 0.", 
    "And notice that j squared is minus 1.", 
    "And so these two canceled out.", 
    "When those two canceled out, I got omega 0 squared divided by", 
    "j omega RL.", 
    "And simplifying that, I ended up at Q, where Q was omega 0", 
    "by 2 alpha.", 
    "And 2 alpha was equal to R divided by L. And of course,", 
    "my omega 0 is 1 over square root of LC.", 
    "OK, so this is again a quick review.", 
    "You've seen all this before.", 
    "And notice how simple the analysis is.", 
    "Impedance analysis is just extraordinarily simple.", 
    "And this parameter Q is a very,", 
    "very interesting parameter.", 
    "What I'm going to do is I'm going to spend some time", 
    "looking at the time domain and frequency domain behavior of", 
    "circuits based on Q."
