    "PROFESSOR: In this segment, we\nwill develop a second method", 
    "that will work for\nlinear circuits.", 
    "This method is called the\nThevenin method, and its", 
    "complementary method,\nthe Norton method.", 
    "So in order to develop this\nmethod for linear circuits,", 
    "suppose you have some arbitrary\nnetwork, N. And", 
    "let&#39;s say in this arbitrary\nnetwork you have a whole bunch", 
    "of resistors, you have a whole\nbunch of voltage sources, Vm,", 
    "and a whole bunch of current\nsources as well.", 
    "OK, so you have a bunch\nof voltage sources.", 
    "And these are all independent\nvoltage sources for now.", 
    "V1, V2, V3, all the\nway through VM.", 
    "You have a whole bunch of\ncurrent sources, I1, I2, I3,", 
    "all the way through to In.", 
    "Suppose I am interested in\napplying some kind of", 
    "excitation due to an external\ncurrent source with current i.", 
    "And let us say that all I care\nto do is to determine the", 
    "voltage, V. So the setup here\nis I have an arbitrary", 
    "network, N, with a ton of\nresistors and voltage sources", 
    "and current sources,\nall independent.", 
    "And I apply an external\nexcitation, and", 
    "it&#39;s a current i.", 
    "And just assume that all I want\nto do is to determine the", 
    "voltage, V. Assume that I don&#39;t\ncare about any internal", 
    "voltages, Vi, or any internal\ncurrents, Ij, and so on.", 
    "Let&#39;s say I don&#39;t care\nabout any of", 
    "those internal currents.", 
    "All I care about is\nthe voltage, V.", 
    "So in a situation like this\nwhere you care about some", 
    "voltage or current at some\npoint, you can use the", 
    "property of linearity and the\nresulting superposition", 
    "property to develop an extremely\npowerful method to", 
    "get you to your answer\nvery quickly.", 
    "So in order to develop this\nmethod, let me use the", 
    "superposition technique and try\nto figure out the voltage,", 
    "V. So the voltage V will be\nsome combination of the", 
    "sources in this circuit.", 
    "So let&#39;s say, for example,\nI want to figure out the", 
    "contribution to the voltage V\ndue to the voltage source, Vm.", 
    "What I would then do is I would\nset i to 0, I would set", 
    "all the currents, I1 through In,\nto 0, and I would set all", 
    "the voltages, V1 through Vm\nminus 1, to 0 as well, and", 
    "just look at the impact on\nV due to Vm acting alone.", 
    "So the impact on V due to Vm\nacting alone, and notice that", 
    "once all the currents have been\nturned off and all the", 
    "other voltages have been turned\noff, I&#39;m left with a", 
    "big resistor network.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to get some\nmultiplier here.", 
    "Let&#39;s label that alpha m.", 
    "So that will be the result of\nthe source Vm acting alone on", 
    "the output voltage, V.", 
    "Similarly, I can do the same\nthing for all the voltages.", 
    "I can do it for V1\nacting alone.", 
    "I can do it for V2 acting alone,\nand so on and so forth.", 
    "For each of those voltages,\nV1, V2, and so on, I get a", 
    "term that looks like this.", 
    "I get alpha 1 V1, alpha 2 V2,\nand so on and so forth, all", 
    "the way through alpha m Vm.", 
    "And so what I get is a sum over\nm of all of these terms.", 
    "By applying V1 acting alone and\nV2 acting alone and so on,", 
    "I get a term, alpha 1 V1,\nalpha 2 V2, and so on.", 
    "Next, I&#39;ll move on to the\ncurrents, and in this case,", 
    "supposing I set all the\ncurrents, say, for In--", 
    "I&#39;m going to set the small i to\n0, and I&#39;m going to set all", 
    "the Vm&#39;s to 0, and I&#39;m going\nto set all the currents, I1", 
    "through In minus 1, to 0.", 
    "So in that situation, I&#39;m going\nto get some factor, Bn,", 
    "that applies to In.", 
    "So I&#39;ve got some factor Bn, beta\nn, that applies to In.", 
    "And that is the result\nof In acting alone.", 
    "Similarly, I can have I1 acting\nalone, I2 acting alone,", 
    "and so on, and for each of them,\nI get a term, beta 1 I1", 
    "plus beta 2 I2 and so\non and so forth.", 
    "And I sum them all up\nas well over all n.", 
    "So with i acting alone, I&#39;m\ngoing to set all of the other", 
    "In&#39;s and Vm&#39;s to 0, and just\nhave i acting alone.", 
    "And so therefore I will get an\ni, and I&#39;m going to have some", 
    "multiplier.", 
    "And in this case, notice that\nwhen all the Vm&#39;s and all the", 
    "In&#39;s are set to 0, I&#39;m just\nleft with a big resistor", 
    "network here.", 
    "And so it will look like a big\neffective resistor looking", 
    "into this port.", 
    "And so let me write that down\nas some R multiplied", 
    "by the current i.", 
    "So notice now that the voltage\nV is a sum of a bunch of", 
    "components that arise from the\nvoltages acting alone, the", 
    "currents acting alone, and also\nthe external excitation", 
    "acting alone.", 
    "And just recall, how\ndid I get this?", 
    "How did I get each\nof these terms?", 
    "So this term which sums up all\nthe voltages I got by setting", 
    "all the In&#39;s to 0 and by\nsetting the external", 
    "excitation to 0.", 
    "Similarly, I got the second term\nhere by setting all the", 
    "voltage sources to 0, and also\nby setting the external", 
    "excitation to 0.", 
    "And finally, this last term, I\ngot that by setting all the", 
    "currents to 0 and all\nthe voltages to 0.", 
    "So what we&#39;re going to do now\nis by using this insight,", 
    "we&#39;re going to build\nup a new technique.", 
    "And to give you a preview to\nthat technique, I&#39;m going to", 
    "show you a trick that will\nenable you to replace this", 
    "network, N, by something\nvery, very simple.", 
    "In fact, I&#39;m going to show you\nthat we&#39;re going to be able to", 
    "replace that entire network by\nsome voltage source and some", 
    "resistor acting in series.", 
    "And this will be able to replace\nthis entire network,", 
    "N, for the purpose of computing\nthe voltage, V. So", 
    "just think of that as a\npreview of upcoming", 
    "attractions.", 
    "So moving on, let&#39;s take a look\nat the equation that we", 
    "just developed and understand\nthat a little bit more.", 
    "So if you look at the equation\nhere that we developed, V is", 
    "some component related to Vm&#39;s,\nsome component related", 
    "to In&#39;s, and some component\nrelated to the external", 
    "excitation, i.", 
    "So if you look at this term\nhere, if you look at the alpha", 
    "m term here, that\nhas no units.", 
    "It has no units because I have\na voltage on the left-hand", 
    "side and it&#39;s multiplying\na voltage.", 
    "Similarly, beta and In must\nresult in a voltage, and so", 
    "therefore beta n must have\nresistance units.", 
    "And then similarly, R that is\nmultiplying i must have", 
    "resistance units as well.", 
    "So notice that if you look at\nthe Vm-related term and the", 
    "In-related term, then what you\nsee is that together they are", 
    "independent of the external\nexcitation, and the behave", 
    "like a voltage.", 
    "Similarly, if you look at the\nright-hand term here, Ri,", 
    "that&#39;s a resistance multiplied\nby a current, and of course,", 
    "that also has resulting\nvoltage units.", 
    "So let&#39;s look at the first part\nhere, the part comprising", 
    "the Vm&#39;s and the In&#39;s.", 
    "That behaves like a voltage,\nand it is independent of", 
    "external excitation.", 
    "And so what I&#39;m going to do is\nI am going to call it VTH.", 
    "And don&#39;t worry about why I&#39;m\ncalling it VTH right now, but", 
    "let&#39;s assume that\nI call it VTH.", 
    "So that&#39;s a first component\nthat is independent of", 
    "external excitation and behaves\nlike a voltage.", 
    "Now if you look at the second\ncomponent, as I said earlier,", 
    "the second component clearly\ndepends on the current, i.", 
    "But if you look at the\nmultiplier R, then that is", 
    "also independent of external\nexcitation and", 
    "behaves like a resistor.", 
    "So let&#39;s call that RTH.", 
    "So again, if you look at the\nterm that gives you V, it will", 
    "now comprise a portion that\nwe&#39;ve called VTH.", 
    "And it has a second component\nthat relates to the external", 
    "excitation, i, by is multiplied\nby something we", 
    "call RTH, where the RTH is\nindependent of the external", 
    "excitation, i.", 
    "So what I&#39;ve just done is I&#39;ve\nwritten down the excitation as", 
    "a sum of a voltage here that I\ndecided to call VTH, and I&#39;ve", 
    "also said that the second\npart is RTH times i.", 
    "And that is equal to the\nvoltage, V. So notice V equals", 
    "VTH plus RTH i.", 
    "So in other words, if you look\nat this expression here, as", 
    "far as the external world is\nconcerned-- and again, for the", 
    "purpose of computing the\nvoltage, our network N is", 
    "completely indistinguishable\nfrom another network.", 
    "What does that network\nlook like?", 
    "So this whole network, N, can\nbe replaced by the following", 
    "network that I&#39;m going to show\nyou in a quick second.", 
    "So I have a voltage, VTH,\nhere, and I have", 
    "a resistance, RTH.", 
    "And this is my voltage, V. And\nwhat I&#39;ve done here is,", 
    "according to this equation,\nV equals VTH plus RTH i--", 
    "I have simply expressed that\nin circuit form as a little", 
    "pattern showing a VTH and then\nwith an RTH in series.", 
    "And this is easy to see, that\nwhen i is 0, the voltage at", 
    "the output here is VTH.", 
    "And then if I have a short\ncircuit where V is 0, then the", 
    "current through that short\ncircuit will simply be given", 
    "by VTH divided by RTH.", 
    "And so this little pattern\nhere can now replace my", 
    "network N for the purpose\nof computing V.", 
    "This network is called the\nThevenin equivalent network.", 
    "And so I can take this network,\nreplace the arbitrary", 
    "network N with this network,\nthe Thevenin equivalent", 
    "network, and then I can\nconnect my external", 
    "excitation, i, and then compute\nthe voltage V that", 
    "appears across the terminals.", 
    "In other words, what I&#39;ve done\nis, using the Thevenin method,", 
    "I can take an arbitrary network\nN. I can figure out", 
    "the VTH and RTH that relate\nsolely to that network&#39;s", 
    "properties, and then replace\nthat network with", 
    "VTH and RTH in series.", 
    "And the series connection\nis called the", 
    "Thevenin equivalent network.", 
    "So you will see this\nis another pattern.", 
    "This is called the\nThevenin pattern.", 
    "So in circuits and electronics\ncourses, you will see the", 
    "Thevenin pattern very often.", 
    "And in this pattern, you have\na voltage source in series", 
    "with a resistor.", 
    "And again, it&#39;s easy to see that\nwhen you have I being 0,", 
    "then the Thevenin voltage, VTH,\nappears at the output", 
    "terminal as a VTH.", 
    "And similarly, if you short the\nterminal pair here where V", 
    "is 0, then your current is\ngoing to be given by the", 
    "expression, VTH divided\nby RTH.", 
    "And since the current is going\nto be in the direction", 
    "opposite to this current, i,\nthere will be a negative.", 
    "But essentially you can see why\nthis expression, V equals", 
    "VTH plus RTH i, directly\nrelates to the Thevenin", 
    "pattern with the voltage source\nin series with the", 
    "resistance.",
