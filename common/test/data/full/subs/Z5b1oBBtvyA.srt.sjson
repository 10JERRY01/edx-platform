    "SPEAKER 1: I had cautioned you\nearlier that we had been", 
    "working with an extremely\nsimplistic model of the", 
    "MOSFET, and that is behavior in\nreal life is considerably", 
    "more complex.", 
    "And in fact, over the next few\nminutes, we will look at kind", 
    "of the next level model for the\nMOSFET, which is slightly", 
    "more accurate.", 
    "But it&#39;s still a gross\nsimplification", 
    "of the actual behavior.", 
    "It will be several lectures\nbefore we will cover a much", 
    "more closer representation\nof the MOSFET looks like.", 
    "But as a next step, let&#39;s do a\nslightly more refined model of", 
    "the MOSFET.", 
    "And here it is.", 
    "In our previous simplistic model\ncalled the S model, or", 
    "the switch model of the MOSFET,\nwe simply said that", 
    "the MOSFET was an open circuit\nwhen V GS was less than VT", 
    "between it&#39;s--", 
    "the open circuit was between\nthe drain and the source", 
    "voltages, then V GS\nwas less than VT.", 
    "So this was an open circuit.", 
    "For the S model, for the switch\nmodel, we said that", 
    "when V GS greater than VT, we\nhad a short circuit between", 
    "the drain and the source, and\nthat was true for when we had", 
    "taken a very, very\nsimplistic model.", 
    "But in reality, what happens is\nthat when you apply a high", 
    "voltage at the gate with respect\nto the source, we", 
    "don&#39;t actually have\na short circuit.", 
    "Rather, there is some finite\nresistance between the drain", 
    "and the source, and\nwe call that R on.", 
    "So the MOSFET turns on.", 
    "So the MOSFET is in\nits on state.", 
    "But even though it&#39;s in its\non state, there is some", 
    "resistance between the drain and\nthe source, and it&#39;s not", 
    "completely an ideal switch.", 
    "And so for example, R on might\nbe on the order of 5 kilohms.", 
    "Now, depending on the kind of\nMOSFET you have and the", 
    "technology you&#39;re using,\nwhether you&#39;re using a", 
    "discrete device, or using a\nMOSFET device within a chip,", 
    "the resistance can change.", 
    "You can also change the size\nof the MOSFET and make the", 
    "resistance of the MOSFET bigger,\nlower, or higher much", 
    "like you could change the\nresistance of some piece of", 
    "material by making the material\nwider and longer, and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "But the SR model for the MOSFET\nsays that in its on", 
    "state, there is a resistance\nbetween the", 
    "drain and the source.", 
    "And in its off state, it behaves\nlike a usual switch,", 
    "which has an open circuit\nbetween the drain and the", 
    "source terminals.", 
    "So with the SR model of the\nMOSFET in mind, we can", 
    "actually go ahead and\nplot the i DS versus", 
    "V DS for the MOSFET.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with, just as\nreference, on the left-hand", 
    "side of this line, you see the\nMOSFET characteristics", 
    "assuming a very simplistic\nmodel for the MOSFET.", 
    "But to get a really, really\nsimple model for the MOSFET,", 
    "that MOSFET behaved like an\nideal switch, then you would", 
    "see the model shown on the left,\nwhere the V DS versus i", 
    "DS would be either reflective\nof an open", 
    "circuit or a short circuit.", 
    "I should write this as small v\nds and this should be small v", 
    "ds as well.", 
    "So this is v ds and this voltage\nbetween the gate and", 
    "the source is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].", 
    "Similarly here, v GS between\n[? grade ?] and source and v", 
    "DS between the drain and\nthe source terminals.", 
    "This is very simplistic\nswitch model.", 
    "You saw the iV curve\nfor the drain and", 
    "source terminal shown.", 
    "And because the MOSFET had two\nstates, so state- this was its", 
    "on state and this was\nits off state.", 
    "Depending on the state, you got\na different value for the", 
    "i DS versus v DS curve.", 
    "Now let&#39;s look at what it looks\nlike, the i DS versus v", 
    "DS for the MOSFET, assuming\nthe slightly more accurate", 
    "model, the SR model.", 
    "So in this case, when v GS is\nless than VT, the behavior is", 
    "still 0 here.", 
    "Behavior is still the same.", 
    "It&#39;s that of a open circuit.", 
    "So that doesn&#39;t change.", 
    "However, when v GS is greater\nthan or equal to VT, I don&#39;t", 
    "get a perfect open circuit.", 
    "Rather, I get some resistance\nbetween the", 
    "drain and the source.", 
    "So this begins to behave more\nlike a small resistance.", 
    "And the resistance here\nis given by R on.", 
    "So the conductance is 1 divided\nby R on in this i DS", 
    "versus v DS curve.", 
    "So there you have it.", 
    "So this is the i DS versus v DS\ncurve for the MOSFET under", 
    "the state that v GS is\ngreater than Vt.", 
    "This is the on state and\nthis is the off state.", 
    "Let me now show you a quick demo\nshowing you these curves,", 
    "and show that as I switch the\nMOSFET on and off by applying", 
    "either a high voltage or a low\nvoltage between the gate and", 
    "source, you will see the curves\nthat look as I&#39;ve shown", 
    "you just now.",
