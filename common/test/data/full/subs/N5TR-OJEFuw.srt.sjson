    "SPEAKER: This is the fun case, OK?", 
    "The underdamped case.", 
    "Here, alpha is less than omega 0.", 
    "And so therefore, Q will be greater than half.", 
    "Again, this is the case where I'm going to", 
    "get a high Q circuit.", 
    "A high Q filter.", 
    "So in this case, what's going to happen is that at omega 0,", 
    "because I have a high Q filter, I am going to get a", 
    "peaky response, something that looks like this.", 
    "Recall for the underdamped case, I got a", 
    "behavior like this.", 
    "But for the overdamped case, I get something that looks like", 
    "this, where this value is Q. If Q is 20, then this", 
    "amplitude here will be 20 times the amplitude for every", 
    "low frequency signal.", 
    "So notice here that this filter has a", 
    "very, very sharp response.", 
    "And recall we talked about bandwidth.", 
    "So the bandwidth of a filter is measured at 1 by square", 
    "root 2 of the peak value.", 
    "So if I take 1y square root 2 of the peak value, which is Q,", 
    "then notice that this bandwidth is very narrow.", 
    "Narrow bandwidth.", 
    "The bandwidth is defined as the interval between the", 
    "points in the curve where the response falls to 1 by square", 
    "root 2 of the peak value.", 
    "And 1 by square root 2 is 0.707.", 
    "And sometimes it's also called the 0.707 frequency at which", 
    "you reach the 1 by square root 2 value.", 
    "Either way, it's a narrow band, and it's", 
    "a very high Q filter.", 
    "What happens in the time domain?", 
    "Again, recall for the step function, let's look at what", 
    "happens in the time domain.", 
    "In the time domain, you recall underdamped circuits.", 
    "Underdamped circuits gave rise to a lot of ringing.", 
    "They were not sluggish.", 
    "So for this capacitor's circuit, it would eventually", 
    "settle down at 1.", 
    "But I would get a whole bunch of ringing here.", 
    "And you recall that the number of rings--", 
    "so this is 1 ring, 2 rings, 3 rings and so on, that Q gives", 
    "me the number of rings, approximately.", 
    "So I approximately get Q rings in this circuit.", 
    "So what that says is that when I apply a step, the circuit is", 
    "going to ring for a long time if Q is large.", 
    "So for instance, if I have a Q of 50, then the circuit is", 
    "going to sit around ringing for about 50 rings.", 
    "And of course, notice that if I make R close to 0, if R goes", 
    "close to 0, then this just becomes LC.", 
    "And recall, for an LC circuit, it will ring forever.", 
    "Provide a unit step, they will simply ring forever", 
    "and ever and ever.", 
    "Because Q for that circuit would be infinity", 
    "when R goes to 0.", 
    "So the key here is that in the time domain, Q relates to how", 
    "ringy the circuit is.", 
    "Q relates to ringiness.", 
    "And in the frequency domain, Q relates to peakiness in the", 
    "frequency domain.", 
    "So that gives you a sense of how circuits behave when the Q", 
    "is very high.", 
    "As a next step, I'd like to go and take a", 
    "look at critical damping."
