    "SPEAKER 1: So there you saw a more fuller behavior of the", 
    "MOSFET, where you saw that if I drew this transition line", 
    "here, this transition curve given by VDS equals the VGS", 
    "minus VT, then to the left of it at the triode region with", 
    "VDS less than VGS minus VT.", 
    "And to the right-hand side, I had the saturation region,", 
    "where VDS was greater than or equal to VGS minus VT.", 
    "And in that saturation region, I had the situation where", 
    "MOSFET behaved like a current source.", 
    "Notice that I get current source-like behavior in the", 
    "saturation region of the MOSFET.", 
    "And you'll find out in a second why I'm drawing these", 
    "curves in this funny way, where I've drawn greater", 
    "distances as VGS has been changing.", 
    "It's to signify that, as VGS increases, the current", 
    "increases more than linearly.", 
    "And we'll look at that in a second.", 
    "But for now, suffice it to say that our MOSFET behaves like a", 
    "current source when VDS is greater than or equal", 
    "than VGS minus VT.", 
    "Of course, also VGS needs to be greater", 
    "than or equal to VT.", 
    "So two things are true.", 
    "When VGS here is greater than or equal to VT, and when VDS", 
    "is greater than or equal to VGS minus VT, then I get this", 
    "saturation region operation of the MOSFET.", 
    "And as VGS increases, so does the", 
    "current through the MOSFET.", 
    "So let's look at that in more detail.", 
    "So here's my MOSFET, and we are now ready to", 
    "define the SCS model.", 
    "It's called the switch current source model.", 
    "As I said earlier, there are two constraints.", 
    "When the VGS is more than VT and VDS is greater", 
    "than VGS minus VT.", 
    "In other words, if I make the drain-to-source voltage--", 
    "if I make this voltage large enough, if I make VDS large", 
    "enough-- so this is VDS--", 
    "if I make that large enough compared to VGS minus VT, then", 
    "I get saturation region operation.", 
    "So in the saturation region of the MOSFET, the MOSFET behaves", 
    "like a current source, which is why we call it the switch", 
    "current source model of the MOSFET.", 
    "And because it saturates, it's much more accurate than either", 
    "the S or the SR models.", 
    "So let's just very quickly draw it out.", 
    "So this doesn't change.", 
    "So in the situation where this is my gate, this in my drain,", 
    "this is my source, when VGS is less than VT, I get my MOSFET", 
    "behaving like an off switch.", 
    "So this is my drain and this is my source, and this is plus", 
    "minus VGS, and this is less than VT.", 
    "In that situation, I get an off switch, so", 
    "this is my off state.", 
    "And then I promised you a current source.", 
    "And in this situation, I know the conditions, first, two", 
    "things happen.", 
    "When VGS is greater than or equal to VT and VDS is greater", 
    "than or equal to VGS minus VT, then my MOSFET behaves like a", 
    "current source.", 
    "So let me draw out a dependent current source.", 
    "So this is my MOSFET here, behaving like a dependent", 
    "source, my drain, my source, this is my gate, and this is", 
    "my VGS, and that has been given to me to be", 
    "greater than VT.", 
    "So in that situation, I get a current source-like behavior,", 
    "and this current is IDS.", 
    "And that current is going to be some function of VGS.", 
    "Let me just make it very clear so there's no confusion.", 
    "It is some function of VGS.", 
    "It's not a function of VDS in the saturation region, it is", 
    "flat as a function of VDS.", 
    "And so now I'm ready to tell you what the function really", 
    "looks like.", 
    "This should not come as any big surprise, but for the", 
    "MOSFET, the IDS versus VGS relation looks like this.", 
    "It's given by k by 2 VGS minus VT, all squared.", 
    "There you have it.", 
    "So very quickly again.", 
    "The MOSFET behaves like a current source in its", 
    "saturation region.", 
    "So this in its saturation region.", 
    "And in that saturation region, the MOSFET current, IDS, is a", 
    "function of VGS and is given by k over 2 VGS", 
    "minus VT, all squared.", 
    "And it's a voltage-controlled current source, VCCS, because", 
    "the input voltage, VGS, controls the", 
    "output current, IDS.", 
    "That's why it's a VCCS.", 
    "It's non-linear because there's a square law", 
    "relationship between the current, IDS, and", 
    "the voltage, VGS.", 
    "So an off switch and then the saturation region, provided of", 
    "course, VDS is greater than or equal to VGS minus VT, the", 
    "MOSFET behaves like a current source, whose current is given", 
    "by IDS equals k over 2 times VGS minus VT, all squared."
