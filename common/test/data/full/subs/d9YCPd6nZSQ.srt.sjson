    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so for the NAND\ngate, as usual, in my truth", 
    "table, I can have--", 
    "I write down all the possible\ncombinations of the inputs,", 
    "00, 01, 10, and 11.", 
    "And then I write down the\noutputs as follows.", 
    "So the output is you treat it\nlike a NAND gate, and then you", 
    "flip the output.", 
    "So if it&#39;s 0 0, for AND gate,\nthe output would be a 0.", 
    "But then I invert it, and\nso it becomes a 1.", 
    "Similarly, for a 0 1, for an AND\ngate, the output is a 0.", 
    "So for a NAND gate, I invert\nit to a 1, and", 
    "1 0 is 1, as well.", 
    "However, for the 1 1, the AND\ngate would have given you a 1,", 
    "so the NAND gate will\ngive you a 0.", 
    "So if you compare, the AND gate\nand the NAND gate, or the", 
    "outputs are inversions\nof each other.", 
    "So in English, the NAND gate can\nbe expressed as behaving", 
    "in the following way, that it&#39;s\noutput is going to be a", 
    "low, when both the\ninputs are true.", 
    "Otherwise, it&#39;s ouptut\nis gonna be a 1.", 
    "In the Boolean equation, I can\nwrite down z equals x dot y,", 
    "and then I invert\nthe whole thing.", 
    "So that is a NAND gate.", 
    "I can do another kind of gate.", 
    "And in this situation, let me\nstart by giving you a logic", 
    "expression for it.", 
    "So here&#39;s another gate in which\nif A is true or B is", 
    "true, then C is true.", 
    "In other words, if I go to the\nstore and I have my wallet", 
    "with me, or if the item is free,\nthen I can get the item.", 
    "So in other words, as an\nanalogy, again, if I go to the", 
    "store and I want to buy an item,\nthen if the item costs", 
    "money-- if A is true, if I have\nmy wallet, or if the item", 
    "is free, then I can get\nthe item, where C", 
    "is I get the item.", 
    "So if neither of those are true,\nin other words, if I", 
    "don&#39;t have my wallet and the\nitem is not free, then C is", 
    "gonna be false.", 
    "So in this situation, I\ncould write a Boolean", 
    "equation for this.", 
    "And the Boolean equation is\ngiven by C equals A plus B.", 
    "This is a Boolean equation,\nand in this case, the", 
    "plus is a or sign.", 
    "Think of the plus as an or.", 
    "So when I&#39;m operating on Boolean\nvalues, the dot and", 
    "plus, the dot means and\nand the plus means or.", 
    "This simply says that C is the\nOR-ing of A and B. And I can", 
    "write this as a gate, as well.", 
    "So if my inputs are A and\nB, then the OR gate is", 
    "represented like so.", 
    "This is and OR gate.", 
    "I can also write the truth\ntable for the OR gate.", 
    "And so I can write down A, B,\nand C. And let me give you a", 
    "chance of writing the truth\ntable for the OR gate.",
