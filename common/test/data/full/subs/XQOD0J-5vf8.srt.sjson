    "that I had used in the previous\nsequence, the", 
    "motivation to really demonstrate\nwhy small-signal", 
    "model can be really\nuseful for us.", 
    "So in this motivating example,\nI was looking to transmit", 
    "music over a light beam.", 
    "And I had this device that I\ncalled the Light Emitting", 
    "expoDweep, a hypothetical\ndevice, which had a nonlinear", 
    "characteristic that\nlooked like this.", 
    "This was the vD and\nthis was iD.", 
    "And I was looking to transmit\nmusic in a linear manner over", 
    "that device.", 
    "So the construction\nis the following.", 
    "Let me very quickly review\nthe construction.", 
    "I have an input voltage,\nvI, think of", 
    "this as my music signal.", 
    "And that falls directly across\nthe LED, which produces some", 
    "light intensity, which impinges\non the receiver,", 
    "which is a photoreceiver.",

    "vD to iD was nonlinear.",

    "distortion in my music.", 
    "So my goal is to try to get this\ntransfer happening in the", 
    "linear way and get a linear\nresponse out of the system.", 
    "So how do I really go\nabout doing this?", 
    "Let me just very quickly also\nreview the kind of wave forms", 
    "that you get when you\nhave a nonlinear", 
    "device in the system.", 
    "So as an example here, let\nme continue with the same", 
    "motivating circuit.", 
    "And here is my i-v\ncharacteristic of the LED.", 
    "And let&#39;s very quickly look at\nthe kind of curves that you", 
    "see with this.", 
    "And again, this is just\na review of what I", 
    "covered the last time.", 
    null, 
    "So if I plot vD versus\ntime, vD here is", 
    "a nice little sinusoid.", 
    null, 
    "And when I look at how vD gets\nconverted to iD, I can do the", 
    "following construction that\nI showed you last time.",

    "be plotted at various points\non the x-axis is related to", 
    "the iV curve of the device and\nit can find corresponding", 
    "values of iD for each\nvalue of vD.", 
    "For excursions of vD as shown\nhere, I end up getting an iD", 
    "as shown on the left-hand\nside.", 
    "Notice that iD looks quite a\nbit different from vD and", 
    "that&#39;s because of the distortion\nhappening not only", 
    "because my iD verses vD curve is\nnonlinear, but also because", 
    "of this flat region here on\nthe negative vD axis.", 
    "And because of this, my iD\nends up looking very much", 
    "unlike a sinusoid and that\ngives rise to a lot of", 
    "distortion of the circuit.", 
    "I though I&#39;d do a fun little\ndemo for you to show how I&#39;m", 
    "constructing the output given\nand input, where the input", 
    "falls across my device vD and\nI get the output as the", 
    "current produced\nby the device.", 
    "So here is the construction that\nI&#39;m going to do, I plot", 
    "the iD versus vD characteristic\nas before.", 
    "And here I&#39;m going to plot vD\nwhere the time axis is going", 
    "down like this.", 
    "And so vD is plotted such that\nthe vD axis here is parallel", 
    "to the vD axis of the\ntransfer curve.", 
    "And then, as before, I&#39;m going\nto plot the iD curve with time", 
    "going to the right and my iD\naxis parallel with the iD axis", 
    "of the transfer curve.", 
    "So let&#39;s see.", 
    "Let me do a fun little animation\nto see if I can show", 
    "you how things work.", 
    "I expect to see as an output\nthis curve for iD.", 
    "And I had a bunch of fun\nwith PowerPoint.", 
    "And let&#39;s see if I can make\nPowerPoint talk to us and show", 
    "us how I got this iD from vD in\na manner that is about as", 
    "clear as it gets.", 
    "So for example, if you look at\nthis blue point here, this", 
    "corresponds to t equal\nto 0 and vD equals 0.", 
    "So that point corresponds to\nvD equals 0 and iD being", 
    "slightly above 0.",

    "slightly above 0.", 
    "So these three points, call\nthem P1, P2, and P3, are", 
    "related in the fashion that\nI just mentioned.", 
    "So watch those three points and\nI&#39;ve built an animation.",

    "function of time.", 
    "And take a look at what part all\nthe vI characteristic of", 
    "the LED is articulated\nby the changes in vD.", 
    "So pay close attention and have\nsome fun with PowerPoint.", 
    "So as the point moves along to\nbe vD curve and then we have",
