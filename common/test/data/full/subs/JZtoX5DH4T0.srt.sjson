    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "So here is what you do.", 
    "The simple idea here is that\nwe are going to hold the", 
    "sender to tougher standards.", 
    "You&#39;re going to say, hey,\nsender, you have to have", 
    "stronger signals so that even\nif noise gets imposed on it,", 
    "receivers can still receive\nthem correctly.", 
    "So here&#39;s what I&#39;m\ngoing to do.", 
    "What I&#39;m going to do is I will\ntell the sender that to send a", 
    "logical 1 you can send a signal", 
    "between what I call VOH.", 
    "V output high all the\nway to 5 volts.", 
    "Similarly, for a logical 0, I&#39;m\ngoing to tell the sender", 
    "that you can send signals only\nin this little range.", 
    "And I am going to call the\nupper end of the low", 
    "signal range VOL.", 
    "So my sender needs to send\nsignals between VOH and 5", 
    "volts for a logical high\nand VOL and 0 volts", 
    "for a logical low.", 
    "Similarly, I will tell\nthe receiver", 
    "something a little different.", 
    "I will tell the receiver that\nyou will interpret signals all", 
    "the way down to a relatively\nlow value as a logical 1.", 
    "So any of these could\nbe a logical 1.", 
    "And so at the receiver input I\nwant to be able to interpret", 
    "signals that go all the way down\nhere to a value that I", 
    "call VIH, V input high.", 
    "Similarly, for a low signal,\nthe receiver will have to", 
    "interpret a larger range of\nvalues as a logical 0.", 
    "And the high range of the\nlow signal I am going to", 
    "call V input low.", 
    "So notice what has\nhappened here.", 
    "In this case, what I&#39;ve done\nhere is I have said that the", 
    "sender needs to send signals\nthat are in a small range, VOH", 
    "to 5 volts and VOL to 0 volts.", 
    "So VOH, for example, might be 4\nvolts, and VOL, for example,", 
    "might be 1 volt.", 
    "Tell the receiver that I need\nyou to interpret signals that", 
    "group all the way down to VIH.", 
    "And as an example, VIH might\nbe 3 volts, and VIL, as an", 
    "example, might be,\nsay, 2 volts.", 
    "Which means that outputs have to\nbe strong between 4 and 5.", 
    "And at the input, I need to be\nable to interpret signals that", 
    "can droop all the way down to\n3 volts as a logical 1.", 
    "And similarly, for a 0, I need\nto be able to interpret", 
    "signals all the way up to\na VIL, a V input low,", 
    "as a logical 0.", 
    "So notice that I am holding\nthe sender to", 
    "very, very tough standards.", 
    "There is a small range of valid\nvalues for the sender.", 
    "But I am telling the receiver,\nhey, I want you to be relaxed.", 
    "I want you to interpret a much\nlarger range of signals as a", 
    "logical 1 and a logical 0.", 
    "And so really, the forbidden\nregion here is a much smaller", 
    "region, where the signal simply\ncannot be present.", 
    "So if I go down that path,\nwhat sort of noise", 
    "margins do I get?", 
    "As I said earlier, this is\na valid 1 at the sender.", 
    "This is a valid 0\nat the sender.", 
    "And the threshold here is V\noutput high and V output low.", 
    "At the receiver, I have a bigger\nrange of valid values", 
    "that the receiver needs\nto interpret as a 1.", 
    "And so this is the lower\nend of the range, VIH.", 
    "And similarly, a range of values\nhere for a logical 0.", 
    "So in this case, what sort of\nnoise margins do I have?", 
    "Let&#39;s start with what is my\nnoise margin for the 1?", 
    "In other words, how much noise\ncan I add into the system and", 
    "still interpret the weakest\npossible 1 as a valid 1.", 
    "So let&#39;s look at it.", 
    "In this case, the weakest\npossible 1 that the sender can", 
    "send is a VOH.", 
    "So if this was four volts, for\ninstance, that would be the", 
    "weakest one that the\nsender could send.", 
    "And if I added the most amount\nof noise in the system, then", 
    "the receiver will interpret\nsignals all the way down to", 
    "VIH as a logical one, which\nmeans that my signal can get", 
    "corrupted by as much as this\nrange here, and my receiver", 
    "will still get the\nright answer.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So this range here is called\nthe noise margin.", 
    "So this is a noise\nmargin for a 1.", 
    "And similarly, this is the\nnoise margin for the 0.", 
    "In other words, the highest\nvalue that the sender could", 
    "send and be legal is VOL,\nand just, for example,", 
    "might be 1 volt here.", 
    "And similarly, at the receiver\nthe VIL might be", 
    "as high as two volts.", 
    "So therefore, any value from 1\nvolt to 2 volts is considered", 
    "a logical 0.", 
    "And so therefore, I have about\n1 volt of noise margin for 0.", 
    "Similarly, for a logical high,\nsince this is 4 volts, I have", 
    "any value between 3 volts and\n4 volts as a logical 1.", 
    "And so my noise margin\nthere is 1 volt.", 
    "So there again, I can summarize\nmy noise margins as", 
    "follows, where my 1 noise margin\nis any value between", 
    "VOH and VIH.", 
    "So I can simply write\ndown VOH minus VIH", 
    "is my 1 noise margin.", 
    "And my 0 noise margin is\nany value from VOL all", 
    "the way up to VIL.", 
    "So here it is simply-- the\ndifference is VIL minus VOL.", 
    "So the noise margin for a 1 is\nVOH, which can droop all the", 
    "way down to VIH.", 
    "And for a 0 noise margin, it is\na VOL that can go all the", 
    "way up to VIL.", 
    "And I will still recognize\nthat as a logical 1.", 
    "So together, these values--", 
    "VOH, VIH, VOL, and VIL--", 
    "are the thresholds that\ndefine a discipline.", 
    "That define a discipline, or a\nconvention, or a contract, or", 
    "a standard that all digital\ndevices in my digital land, or", 
    "the digital part of the\nplayground, must follow so", 
    "that they can talk\nto each other.", 
    "This is a really, really\nkey principle.", 
    "So once you enter a digital\nland, then all the devices in", 
    "digital land must adhere\nto a standard.", 
    "The standard is that to send\nout a logical 1, my value", 
    "needs to be between VOH\nand 5 volts and to", 
    "promise to do that.", 
    "And similarly for logical 0&#39;s\nat the sender and to receive", 
    "values, as well.", 
    "So these thresholds--", 
    "V output high, V input high, V\noutput low, and V input low", 
    "are four values, or four\nthresholds, that comprise a", 
    "standard or a discipline that\nall the devices are going to", 
    "follow together within digital\nland so that they can talk to", 
    "each other correctly.", 
    "It&#39;s like saying that if we are\nall going to enter France.", 
    "And once within France, they are\nall going to speak French.", 
    "We are simply agreeing that once\nthey are all within this", 
    "area, within this land,\nthey are all", 
    "going to talk a language.", 
    "And that&#39;s a language\nof 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s.", 
    "The voltage thresholds are\ngoverned by these four voltage", 
    "thresholds.", 
    "And as long as we stick to this\nconvention, we can all be", 
    "working correctly and not\nmaking any mistakes.",
