    "SPEAKER 1: Next, let&#39;s talk\nabout the third method of", 
    "circuit analysis, of nonlinear\ncircuit analysis.", 
    "And this is called the\nincremental method.", 
    "The method is also called\nthe small signal method.", 
    "Now one way to look at this\nmethod is as a method of", 
    "circuit analysis.", 
    "OK, a small signal method.", 
    "But another even more\ninteresting way to look at it", 
    "is that this indicates a really\ninteresting way of", 
    "using a circuit, and\nit&#39;s called the", 
    "small signal method.", 
    "It is really a very stylized,\nvery special way of using", 
    "nonlinear circuits in a way\nthat can make them linear.", 
    "It is actually pretty amazing.", 
    "I want to show you here, between\na video today and a", 
    "video in the next sequence,\nI&#39;m going to show you a", 
    "technique whereby we&#39;ll take a\nhighly nonlinear circuit, and", 
    "then show you a trick which\nwill enable us to use that", 
    "same circuit to produce the same\nkind of results as if it", 
    "were a linear circuit.", 
    "It is pretty spectacular.", 
    "So this is one those key\ninsights that you will get and", 
    "will result in one\nof those big aha", 
    "moments of this course.", 
    "I think you&#39;ll see many of\nthese big aha moments.", 
    "One of them was when we went\nfrom the user lumped circuit", 
    "abstraction to the lumped matter\ndiscipline, suddenly", 
    "Maxwell&#39;s equations turned into\nKVL KCL, which were very", 
    "simple algebraic rules.", 
    "And getting into the ESC\nplayground was one those big", 
    "aha moments.", 
    "The second big moment you\nmight recall was when we", 
    "entered the digital domain.", 
    "There, we said, let&#39;s focus\non values 0 and 1.", 
    "And by doing so, you suddenly\nrealize that you could get", 
    "incredible noise immunity\nand be able to correctly", 
    "communicate, even in the\npresence of noise.", 
    "Another big aha moment.", 
    "So this small signal trick will\nyield a third big aha", 
    "moment in this course.", 
    "So to motivate the technique,\nwhether you view it as an", 
    "analysis technique, or whether\nyou view it as a really,", 
    "really cool trick or a cool hack\nfor building circuits of", 
    "a given kind, let me\nmotivate it using", 
    "the following example.", 
    "I&#39;m looking to transmit music\nover a light beam.", 
    "And I&#39;m going ask you,\ncan we pull this off?", 
    "And I&#39;m going to look for a\ndevice in order to do this.", 
    "So there is this device, a light\nemitting dial, and a", 
    "photoresistor that\nare commonly used", 
    "in garage door openers.", 
    "In a garage door opener, many\nof you may have seen a light", 
    "that shines across the door of\nthe garage so that if you cut", 
    "that light, then something\nwill happen.", 
    "The door might shut\nor whatever.", 
    "You&#39;ve probably seen many of\nthese movies as well, that Tom", 
    "Cruise and others, with lots\nof these light beams", 
    "all over the floor.", 
    "And if somebody cuts one of the\nlight beams, then strange", 
    "things happen.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to use a garage\ndoor opener and a light beam", 
    "and try to see if I can transmit\nmusic over the light", 
    "beam produced by such a\ngarage door opener.", 
    "And I&#39;ll show you a fun\nlittle demo as well.", 
    "So the circuit I could draw\nlooks as follows.", 
    "So here is my LED, my little\ndevice, that will produce", 
    "light when current\nflows through it.", 
    "So this is VD and this is iD.", 
    "And so what I&#39;m going to do,\njust for kicks, I&#39;m going to", 
    "show you an extraordinarily\nsimple circuit.", 
    "You won&#39;t really use these\ncircuits in real life.", 
    "But for the purposes of\nunderstanding what we&#39;re", 
    "doing, I think this is OK\nfor pedagogical reasons.", 
    "And so, let&#39;s say I apply\nsome input VI of t, a", 
    "time bearing voltage.", 
    "And my goal here will be to see\nif I can transmit music", 
    "over light produced by a highly\nnonlinear device.", 
    "So my voltage--", 
    "so this is my node voltage VD,\ndefined with respect to some", 
    "ground here.", 
    "So, the LED.", 
    "Think of the LED as a\nfun little device.", 
    "If you want to have even more\nfun, why don&#39;t we call it the", 
    "Light Emitting expoDweep.", 
    "Imagine there&#39;s some magical\nexpoDweep that looked like", 
    "what we had before, with the\nsame characteristic.", 
    "Assume that this device, the\nLight Emitting expoDweep, had", 
    "the exact same characteristic\nas the expoDweep devices", 
    "earlier, a very nonlinear\ndevice.", 
    "So, connect this device\nup like this.", 
    "And imagine that this LED\nLight Emitting expoDweep", 
    "produces light who&#39;s\nintensity--", 
    "let me call that light\nintensity XD.", 
    "Let&#39;s say the light intensity is\nproportional to the current", 
    "that flows to the device iD.", 
    "OK, so this device is going\nto produce some", 
    "light with some intensity.", 
    "And the intensity, XD,\nis going to be", 
    "proportional to iD.", 
    "So I apply voltage across\nthe device.", 
    "I produce a current.", 
    "And the current produces\nlight.", 
    "And then, I&#39;m looking\nto transmit music", 
    "over a light beam.", 
    "So, I need some music\nof course.", 
    "So, let&#39;s say here&#39;s my VI\nof t, my music signal.", 
    "And let me do my best to\ndraw some sort of a", 
    "music signal here.", 
    "And I&#39;m looking to transmit that\nover the light beam that", 
    "is produced by VD.", 
    "Now in real life, there are\ndevices called LEDs.", 
    "These stand for Light\nEmitting Diodes.", 
    "And just for this course, I\ninvented a pedagogical device,", 
    "Light Emitting expoDweep.", 
    "The reason I&#39;m not using real\nLEDs, or Light Emitting", 
    "Diodes, is that the diode has\na slightly more complicated", 
    "equation between the leading V\nand I. And it just hampers the", 
    "analysis a little bit.", 
    "So if you&#39;d like, you can go and\nlook up the textbook for", 
    "the real diode curve.", 
    "But for now, let&#39;s just imagine\nthat this is a Light", 
    "Emitting expoDweep, which is\na simplified real life LED.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do then\nis, on the other side, I&#39;m", 
    "going to place a\nphotoreceiver.", 
    "So this guy here is my rendition\nof a photoreceiver.", 
    "And what this photoreceiver does\nis that it takes light", 
    "impinging on it, and it&#39;s going\nto produce a current,", 
    "iR, that relates to this.", 
    "Again, then I&#39;m going to have\nsome sort of an amplifier", 
    "that&#39;s going to do its thing.", 
    "And eventually, you&#39;re going to\nhear some sound that comes", 
    "out of a speaker on\nthe other side.", 
    "So the photoreceiver is going\nto produce some current, i,", 
    "that comes out.", 
    "And let&#39;s say that this current,\ni, is proportional to", 
    "the intensity of light that\nfalls on the photoreceiver.", 
    "So the light produced\nby the LED is--", 
    "intensity produced by the LED\nis XD, proportional to iD.", 
    "And iR is the current in\nthe photoreceiver.", 
    "And that is iR.", 
    "And that is related to the\nintensity of light on the", 
    "photoreceiver, XR.", 
    "So here, this is the light\nintensity in the receiver.", 
    "OK, so there&#39;s my\nbasic system.", 
    "To summarize, what am\nI trying to do here?", 
    "I have a LED.", 
    "And this could be part of my\ngarage door opener circuit.", 
    "And it&#39;s emitting\na light beam.", 
    "And I want to transmit music\nfrom one side to the other.", 
    "And I want to transmit\nmusic over here.", 
    "So VI of t is my music signal.", 
    "I want to transfer my music\nsignal over to light beam and", 
    "listen to it on the\nother side.", 
    "For whatever reason.", 
    "And my question to you\nis, will this work?", 
    "Clearly, if I voltage signal\nrelated to the music signal,", 
    "the voltage is going\nto fall across the", 
    "Light Emitting Diode.", 
    "Or Light Emitting expoDweep\nin this case.", 
    "I get some current, iD.", 
    "The light intensity\nrelates to iD.", 
    "That light falls on\nthe photoreceiver.", 
    "It produces a current.", 
    "That current goes through\nan amplifier,", 
    "and I get some sound.", 
    "So what happens when\nI do this?", 
    "So this is my goal.", 
    "This is what I&#39;m trying to do.", 
    "And I asked you the question,\ncan we pull this off?",
