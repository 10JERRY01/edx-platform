    "SPEAKER 1: So the canonical two-terminal nonlinear device", 
    "is called a diode.", 
    "It has a symbol like this.", 
    "Voltage and currents go this way.", 
    "And if I were to plot its I-V characteristics, the I-V", 
    "characteristics look something like this.", 
    "And what you can see here is as I change the voltage a", 
    "little bit, the curve changes hardly at all over here, but", 
    "if I change the voltage a little bit over here, the", 
    "current changes a lot.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: OK, in fact the actual characteristic of the", 
    "diode iD is some constant determined by the geometry of", 
    "the diode times e to the voltage across the diode", 
    "divided by some threshold voltage, which is a", 
    "characteristic of the physics of the diode, minus 1.", 
    "That's the actual characteristic of the diode.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And I can use a diode in a little circuit.", 
    "This is a very kind of nasty equation.", 
    "So let's draw a circuit with a diode.", 
    "So I drew such a circuit over here.", 
    "We skipped ahead a little bit.", 
    "And we have a resistor, a diode over here.", 
    "And what we can do is we can analyze", 
    "this by nodal analysis.", 
    "We can label this node ground, write Kirkhoff's curve law", 
    "over here, label this the node V. And we'll get, I guess, one", 
    "equation, one unknown, and an abstract.", 
    "If we could solve that, we'd get the voltage here and the", 
    "current through there.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: No we can't solve that.", 
    "It's in general, an exponential equation, and", 
    "indeed, we can only use numerical techniques perhaps", 
    "to solve things like that.", 
    "In general, if you tried to solve those, there's no closed", 
    "form solution that you can derive algebraically.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Except on problem sets.", 
    "There usually are in problem sets.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: There might be, but not for the", 
    "particular circuit you drew.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Of course not.", 
    "So the technique that you kind of do if you want to do this", 
    "numerically is to just sort of pick a voltage, see if it's", 
    "too high too low, pick another one, and eventually get there.", 
    "You can either do this by head or computationally, but it's a", 
    "tedious procedure.", 
    "So instead of this, what we do is we divide", 
    "this into two circuits.", 
    "We have a circuit for a diode over here and we have the", 
    "second circuit for the rest of the circuit over here.", 
    "And what we do is we first plot the I-V characteristics", 
    "of the diode, which we already have. And we use this as the", 
    "current and plus minus for the voltage.", 
    "And then we plot the same thing for", 
    "the rest of the circuit.", 
    "So we get a line that looks something like this.", 
    "Over here it's important to not make mistakes with signs.", 
    "We're not using the standard sign", 
    "conventions on this circuit.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: For the red circuit.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: We're following the same sign conventions as we", 
    "had for the diode.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Because we're plotting it", 
    "on the diode's graph.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And at that point, we get a point where are the", 
    "two intersect and that's where you have to be.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And that's called a load line.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So you'll see that in the next sequence."
