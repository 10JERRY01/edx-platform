    "SPEAKER 1: Alright.", 
    "Let's take a look at how this looks like in practice.", 
    "So let me repeat what we wrote there.", 
    "So big Vc, small c, divided by Vi is Zc", 
    "divided by Zc plus Zr.", 
    "and we showed that that was 1 plus j omega Rc.", 
    "So let's plot that very quickly and see what that", 
    "looks like.", 
    "Let me draw a pair of axes here.", 
    "And in frequency analysis we draw the", 
    "magnitude versus the frequency.", 
    "So, my transfer function H of omega equals Vc over Vi.", 
    "And in this case, let me plot the magnitude of", 
    "the transfer function.", 
    "Let's see what that looks like.", 
    "So here, you should use some intuition to plot this.", 
    "And it is pretty simple.", 
    "So let's take a look at this expression here, 1 divided by", 
    "1 plus j omega Rc, which is a transfer function.", 
    "So the usual trick to do this is to look at low frequencies.", 
    "And, let me just be careful.", 
    "Let's stick with omega here, so there's no confusion.", 
    "So, low omega.", 
    "And look for high omega.", 
    "Alright.", 
    "So what happens when omega is very, very small?", 
    "Well, when omega is very, very small, the right-hand", 
    "component in the denominator is very, very small.", 
    "And so my output is around 1.", 
    "So my output is around 1.", 
    "So this is how things would look like for", 
    "low values of omega.", 
    "Alright, that was straightforward enough.", 
    "What happens when omega is very large?", 
    "When omega is very large, in this case this--", 
    "the right hand side of the denominator--", 
    "becomes very large compared to 1.", 
    "And so 1 divided by j omega Rc and the magnitude of that", 
    "becomes close to 0, because omega is very large.", 
    "So for very large values, for a large omega, I get something", 
    "that looks like that.", 
    "And I connect them as follows.", 
    "OK, so that is my response for very large omegas.", 
    "So a couple of things to note here.", 
    "It's worth looking at why does the circuit behave like this?", 
    "So for low omega, why is the output virtually", 
    "identical to the input?", 
    "Well, if you look at this, this is a resistor, and this", 
    "is a capacitor.", 
    "Now, for very low frequencies, the", 
    "capacitor is an open circuit.", 
    "For small omega, the capacitor is an open circuit, and so not", 
    "surprisingly the output is very close to the input.", 
    "However, for a large omega, the capacitor looks like a", 
    "short circuit.", 
    "And because the capacitor looks like a short circuit, my", 
    "output across that short circuit will", 
    "be very, very small.", 
    "So you should be able to very quickly look at circuits like", 
    "this, and based upon the basic behavior of inductors,", 
    "capacitors and resistors, you should be able to sketch out", 
    "what these responses look like.", 
    "So for this circuit--", 
    "this RC circuit-- the response looks like this.", 
    "For low frequencies, it transfers the input as is.", 
    "And for high frequencies, it attenuates them, and does not", 
    "pass them through.", 
    "Such a circuit which passes low frequencies and kills high", 
    "frequencies, naturally is called a low pass filter.", 
    "Right?", 
    "This is called a low pass filter.", 
    "It's a low pass filter because it passes low frequencies and", 
    "kills high frequencies.", 
    "OK?", 
    "We often refer to this as a LPF or a low pass filter.", 
    "Now recall the circuit was exactly the one that we saw in", 
    "our amplified demo, in S19V2 and this exactly", 
    "reflects the response.", 
    "Let me write that down very quickly.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So what I just wrote down there is that the response", 
    "here is exactly related to, and explains the behavior you", 
    "saw in the amplified demo in sequence 19 video 2, which", 
    "showed that the response--", 
    "the output of that little circuit--", 
    "was such that when I apply the sine wave of the input, the", 
    "output sine wave kept getting smaller and smaller as I", 
    "increased the frequency.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So as omega went up, as the frequency f went up, my output", 
    "kept getting smaller and smaller.", 
    "And that's because it behaved like a low pass filter."
