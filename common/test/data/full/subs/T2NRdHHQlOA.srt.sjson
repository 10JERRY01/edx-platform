    "PROFESSOR: OK, so i1 is very\nquickly calculated by taking", 
    "the difference of V and VTH and\ndividing that by the sum", 
    "of the two resistances.", 
    "So the current i1, flowing in\nthis direction, is given by V", 
    "minus VTH divided\nby R1 plus RTH.", 
    "And there I have it.", 
    "Notice that by converting the\narbitrary network N into the", 
    "Thevenin equivalent, I turn\nthis into a really trivial", 
    "problem where I could write down\ni1 simply by inspection.", 
    "Finally, before we move off\nthe topic of the Thevenin", 
    "network and the Thevenin method,\nit is worthwhile", 
    "staring at this pattern here\ncomprising the voltage source", 
    "in series with the resistance\nand the equation v equals vTH", 
    "plus RTHi that governs the vi\nof the Thevenin pattern.", 
    "So it&#39;s worthwhile looking at\nthis graphically as well.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to show you a\nlittle graph here and plot the", 
    "iv relation for this\nThevenin pattern.", 
    "And usually the way you draw\nthese iv relations is you try", 
    "to find out an open-circuit\nvoltage.", 
    "In other words, try to find out\nof the voltage when the", 
    "current is 0, so open-circuit\nvoltage when i is 0.", 
    "So in this case, when i is set\nto 0 and there&#39;s no current,", 
    "then the open-circuit voltage\nhere is simply", 
    "vTH so v equals vTH.", 
    "So in other words, when\nthe current is 0,", 
    "my voltage is vTH.", 
    "So I found one point on the iv\nrelation for the Thevenin", 
    "equivalent pattern.", 
    "Next, let me find out the\nshort-circuit current.", 
    "And for the short circuit,\nv is set to 0.", 
    "So in this case, I apply a short\ncircuit here, and I&#39;m",

    "So the current in this case,\ni is given by minus",

    "Notice that because vTH is\npositive here, the current", 
    "flows down in this direction and\nis given by vTH divided by", 
    "RTH, and that is in a direction\nopposite to i.", 
    "And so therefore, I get\nthe minus sign.", 
    "So my current is given by minus\nvTH divided by RTH.", 
    "And so for 0 volts, I get some\ncurrent here, and that is", 
    "given by vTH divided by RTH.", 
    "And so this voltage here is my\nopen-circuit voltage, and this", 
    "current here is my short-circuit\ncurrent, OK?", 
    "So this is my short-circuit\ncurrent, and that&#39;s my", 
    "open-circuit voltage, and my iv\nrelation is drawn by simply", 
    "connecting the two points.", 
    "And the slope of this curve is\ngiven by 1 divided by RTH.", 
    "So here again, to very quickly\nsummarize, I&#39;ve drawn the iv", 
    "relation for this definite\npattern, which has a vTH in", 
    "series with an RTH and found two\npoints on the iv relation.", 
    "One is on the voltage axis, and\none is on the current axis", 
    "by measuring the open-circuit\nvoltage and the short-circuit", 
    "current, and then drawing\na line through them.",
