    "SPEAKER 1: So let&#39;s take a\ncloser look at what the MOSFET", 
    "device really looks like when\nwe apply various kinds of", 
    "voltages to it.", 
    "So let&#39;s take the MOSFET, and\nI&#39;m going to try to view it by", 
    "thinking about it as\na pair of ports.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to take my source\nport, my source terminal.", 
    "I&#39;m going to draw it\nout like that.", 
    "I&#39;m going to take the\ndrains terminal", 
    "and draw it out there.", 
    "Take the gate terminal\nand draw it out here.", 
    "So notice that viewed from\nhere, I see a port.", 
    "A port is a terminal pair.", 
    "So a port is a terminal pair.", 
    "And so here, if I have a D here\nand an S, here-- so I&#39;m", 
    "going to call this\nvoltage VDS.", 
    "I can apply a voltage\nVDS here.", 
    "And if I apply voltage VDS,\nlet&#39;s say I get some current", 
    "iDS flowing through here.", 
    "I&#39;ll tell you in a second\nwhy I call it iDS.", 
    "So this is my gate terminal.", 
    "And between the gate terminal\nand the common source, let&#39;s", 
    "say my voltage VGS.", 
    "OK, so I have a voltage VDS\nfrom drain to source and a", 
    "voltage VGS from\ngate to source.", 
    "And I built you this little\npattern, where I take the", 
    "common source terminal and\nI build a pair of ports.", 
    "So one port between drain and\nsource, and a second port", 
    "between gate and source.", 
    "So these terminal pairs\nare called ports.", 
    "And here, let me say I have\nsome current, iG.", 
    "Now, for all of 6002x, current\niG will be taken as zero.", 
    "We are never going to have any\ncurrent flowing into the gate", 
    "terminal in most of 6002x.", 
    "And in the cases where\nwe do, we will", 
    "explicitly tell you so.", 
    "So in other words, what this is\nsaying is that our common", 
    "model of the MOSFET is one where\nthere&#39;s an open circuit", 
    "between the gate and\neither the drain", 
    "or the source terminals.", 
    "And so therefore, when I apply\na voltage VGS, I&#39;m going to", 
    "have a zero current flowing\nthrough it.", 
    "So this in part explains why I\ncall this iDS and not just iD.", 
    "Because if the current from the\ngate is zero, then all the", 
    "current that comes into the\ndrain must be coming out of", 
    "the source.", 
    "So all of this circuit must be\nflowing through here, because", 
    "the current through\nthe gate is zero.", 
    "OK, so that is why I&#39;m\ncomfortable calling that", 
    "current iDS.", 
    "So now let&#39;s try to understand\nthe behavior of the MOSFET", 
    "transistor.", 
    "So the way it works, much like\nwe did for swithces, is look", 
    "at two cases.", 
    "So the one case is where VGS\nis less than some threshold", 
    "voltage, VT.", 
    "OK, so here&#39;s my voltage, VGS.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to apply\na voltage that is", 
    "less than some VT.", 
    "So VT, for example,\nmight be 1 volt.", 
    "Between a system where a VS, the\nhighest is 5 volts and the", 
    "low is 0 volts, my threshold\nvoltage, VT, might be on the", 
    "order of 1 volt per instance.", 
    "So here, if VGS is less than\nVT-- so just as an example,", 
    "let&#39;s say it&#39;s 1 volt.", 
    "If VG is less than\n1 volt, then I&#39;m", 
    "going to get one behavior.", 
    "And if the VGS is greater than\nor equal to VT, I&#39;m going to", 
    "get a different behavior.", 
    "So the MOSFET behaves like so.", 
    "So if VGS is less than VT, the\nMOSFET behaves like an open", 
    "circuit switch.", 
    "OK, so you should have\nguessed this by now.", 
    "So the MOSFET is in what\nwe call an off-state.", 
    "So G is here.", 
    "And this is VGS less than VT.", 
    "And the MOSFET is in\nits off-state.", 
    "OK, my VGS is the voltage\nbetween the", 
    "gate and the source.", 
    "Now when VGS is greater\nthan VT, what happens?", 
    "So in this situation,\nthis is my drain.", 
    "In this situation, I get a\nshort circuit between the", 
    "drain and the source.", 
    "And I can have a nonzero\ncurrent iDS", 
    "flowing through it.", 
    "And this is my gate.", 
    "And this is when a VGS is\ngreater than or equal to VT.", 
    "So what do we have here?", 
    "We have something that\nlargely is very", 
    "reminiscent of our switch.", 
    "Where VGS is less than VT, I\nget open circuit behavior.", 
    "And when VGS is greater than or\nequal to VT, I get a short", 
    "circuit behavior between\nthe D and S terminals.", 
    "This is exactly like\nour switch.", 
    "And in fact, the MOSFET very\ncommonly behaves very nearly", 
    "like an ideal switch in this\nabstract rendition of ours.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So in this case, if you have\ntaken a very simple view of", 
    "the MOSFET and view it like\na switch, we call this the", 
    "switch model, or the S\nmodel of the MOSFET.", 
    "Here, we take this device\nto MOSFET and", 
    "view it as a switch.", 
    "Now, you can go and check out\nthe internal structure of the", 
    "MOSFET in Section 6.7.", 
    "And as we go through various\nadditional lecture sequences,", 
    "we will notice that the MOSFET\nis quite a bit more complex", 
    "than a switch.", 
    "The MOSFET is actually\nmore complex.", 
    "However, as engineers, we need\nto learn to deal with", 
    "abstractions, and we&#39;re\ntaking a very", 
    "simple view of a MOSFET.", 
    "If you&#39;re saying, look, it&#39;s\ngoing to behave like a switch", 
    "in its more simple form\nof behaviors.", 
    "And so, let&#39;s continue with\nthe MOSFET behaving as a", 
    "simple switch and see what we\ncan get using that behavior.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So as the next step, what I&#39;d\nlike to do is I&#39;d like to do a", 
    "little demo for you and take a\nlook at the MOSFET device on a", 
    "scope and convince you that it\nreally behaves like a switch.", 
    "And as before, I&#39;m going to\ntreat it like a two-port.", 
    "One port is the DS port.", 
    "This is the D and the S,\nand this is my gate.", 
    "One port is the DS port, and\none port is the GS port.", 
    "And S port is taken as\ncommon between the", 
    "drain and the source.", 
    "So what I&#39;d like to do is in\nthis demo of ours, I want to", 
    "plot and show you that [? ID ?]", 
    "characteristics of a switch.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to plot for\nyou the following.", 
    "I&#39;m going to plot\niDS versus VDS.", 
    "OK, so between iDS and VDS,\nthis looks like a", 
    "two terminal element.", 
    "However, it&#39;s a funky two\nterminal element.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to plot VDS versus\niDS for that port.", 
    "But what I&#39;m going to do is\nI&#39;m going to plot that a a", 
    "function of VGS.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So as I change VGS, my iDS\nversus VGS, the plot is going", 
    "to look different.", 
    "And in fact, I&#39;m going\nto get two values.", 
    "One is for VGS is greater\nthan or equal to VT.", 
    "And a second value, second curve\nfor VGS less than VT.", 
    "So look at what I&#39;m\ndoing here.", 
    "You haven&#39;t seen this before.", 
    "So I&#39;m showing you the iDS\nrelationship between the drain", 
    "and source terminals\nof the MOSFET.", 
    "You&#39;ve got three terminals.", 
    "So I can plot VDS versus iDS.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to show you what\nVDS versus iDS looks like for", 
    "various values of VGS, which is\nthe gate to source voltage.", 
    "And notice I could very well\nhave drawn a third axis with", 
    "VGS and drawn a plot that way.", 
    "But more commonly, we look at\nthe terminal pair, the DS", 
    "terminal pair with the voltage\nVDS across it, and look at the", 
    "current behavior for different\nvalues of VGS.", 
    "In particular, I&#39;m going to look\nat a VGS value which is", 
    "greater than or equal to VT\nand a VGS value which", 
    "is less than VT.", 
    "So as a switch, I\nhave two states.", 
    "I&#39;m on or off.", 
    "And so therefore, we get two\ncurves for these two states.", 
    "So then, VGS is less than VT.", 
    "And remember, the MOSFET behaves\nlike an open circuit.", 
    "OK, so VGS less than VT,\nthe MOSFET behaves", 
    "like an open circuit.", 
    "So in an open circuit, my\ncurrent is going to be zero no", 
    "matter what VDS is.", 
    "So in VGS less than VT, my\ncurrent is going to be zero", 
    "and my curve is going\nto look like this.", 
    "OK, this the curve of\nan open circuit.", 
    "Let me give you a few seconds to\nthink about what the curve",
