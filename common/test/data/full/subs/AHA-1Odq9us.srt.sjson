    "SPEAKER: Before we move on to\nother things, let&#39;s look at", 
    "one practical detail about this\nlittle amplifier that", 
    "we&#39;ve built.", 
    "So far, we&#39;ve built a little\namplifier using a", 
    "voltage-controlled\ncurrent source.", 
    "There&#39;s one little detail that\nI think it&#39;s worth spending", 
    "some time on.", 
    "So in this little amplifier,\nsomething strange", 
    "was actually happening.", 
    "So if you looked at the\namplifier, here&#39;s my", 
    "vi versus vo curve.", 
    "So notice that the\ncurve falls off.", 
    "Once vi got greater than 1 volt,\nI had a output v0 that", 
    "fell pretty sharply with vi.", 
    "So the question for ourselves\nwas, what would happen after", 
    "vi got large enough, such that\nit got into this region here,", 
    "vi got into that region.", 
    "What would happen there?", 
    "So what would happen there\nis that really, the", 
    "mathematically predicted\nbehavior would look like this.", 
    "So this is really the\nmathematically predicted", 
    "behavior in our amplifier\nbuilt with an abstract", 
    "dependent source.", 
    "Where the dependent source\nrelationship is exactly that", 
    "given here.", 
    "The dependent source exactly\nhad that relationship.", 
    "Of course, this was for\nvi greater than", 
    "or equal to 1 volt.", 
    "And if it had exactly that\nrelationship, then for vi", 
    "greater than 1 volt, the\namplifier would have exactly", 
    "the behavior shown out here.", 
    "So this is an idealized\ndependent source, and that", 
    "would be the behavior\nI would see.", 
    "But let&#39;s stare at this\na little while longer.", 
    "So in this little scenario here,\nlet&#39;s take a look at", 
    "this part of the curve\nand take a look at", 
    "this part of the curve.", 
    "Do you see something\ninteresting here?", 
    "So in this part of the curve,\nnotice that v0 is positive.", 
    "And in this part of the curve,\nnotice that v0 goes negative.", 
    "So v0 goes negative.", 
    "So what is really\ngoing on here?", 
    "So mathematically, what\nwe&#39;ve drawn here", 
    "is perfectly correct.", 
    "But for a practical device,\nwhat do you think", 
    "would happen here?", 
    "So let&#39;s go and stare at that\nfor a little longer.", 
    "And let me just draw\nthis out fully.", 
    "So what would happen in this\nregion, in this region down", 
    "here where v0 became negative.", 
    "So v0 went negative.", 
    "What would happen\nin that region?", 
    "So let&#39;s look at our circuit\nand try to understand", 
    "what was going on.", 
    "So this was a circuit,\nif you remember.", 
    "I had a RL and I had my\ndependent current source.", 
    "This was RL and this was VS.\nAnd I had my v0 over here.", 
    "And I knew this was iD where iD\nwas given by K divided by 2", 
    "vi minus 1 all squared for vi\ngreater than or equal to 1.", 
    "Let&#39;s not worry about the case\nwhere vi was less than 1", 
    "because that case is to the\nleft-hand side, which we don&#39;t", 
    "care about right now.", 
    "We are focused on the case where\nvi is greater than or", 
    "equal to 1.", 
    "So for a situation like that,\nI want you to think a little", 
    "bit about what is happening\nhere and what", 
    "is happening here.", 
    "In particular, I would like you\nto think about the power", 
    "consumed by the device.", 
    "I would like you to think about\nthe power consumed by", 
    "the device.", 
    "So look at these two regions,\nso region a and region b.", 
    "I would like you to think about\nthe power consumed by", 
    "the device.", 
    "And for a, what can you say\nabout the power consumed?", 
    "And in b, what can you say about\nthe power consumed in", 
    "those two regions?", 
    "So let me pause for about five\nseconds and give you a chance", 
    "to think about it.", 
    "And then we can go back and try\nto answer that question.",
