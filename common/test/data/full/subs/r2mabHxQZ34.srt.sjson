    "and answer that question.", 
    "And so let&#39;s look at the power\nconsumed by this device, this", 
    "dependent source of ours.", 
    "So the power consumed\nby the device is", 
    "simply given by V0 iD.", 
    "So this is V0.", 
    "And the current coming\nin here is iD.", 
    "So in this case, the current\ncoming into the positive", 
    "terminal is positive.", 
    "And so therefore, V0 iD is the\npower consumed by the device.", 
    "Now in region A, V0\nis greater than 0.", 
    "So in region A, the\nfollowing is true.", 
    "In region A, V0 was\ngreater than 0.", 
    "So in region A here, V0\nis greater than 0.", 
    "And so therefore, V0\niD is positive.", 
    "And so therefore my voltage\ncontrolled current source", 
    "consumes power.", 
    "OK, not surprising.", 
    "The power consumed on\nmy device is V0 iD.", 
    "And If V0 is positive and\niD is positive by", 
    "this equation here.", 
    "So when VI is positive.", 
    "And notice VI is positive here,\ngreater than 1. iD is", 
    "greater than 1.", 
    "iD is greater than 0.", 
    "And so V0 iD is positive.", 
    "So the VCCS consumes power.", 
    "But then something very\nstrange happens in b.", 
    "As soon as VI increases beyond\na point, V0 becomes negative.", 
    "When V0 becomes negative, it\nbecomes less than 0, then", 
    "something very strange\nhappens.", 
    "V0 iD becomes negative.", 
    "In other words, when V0 is\nnegative, V0 iD is negative.", 
    "And so therefore, the VCCS,\nsuddenly from being a net", 
    "consumer, suddenly appears\nto be supplying power.", 
    "So suddenly as I keeps\nincreasing, this abstract", 
    "dependent source suddenly from\nbeing a net consumer of power,", 
    "suddenly begins to\nsupply power.", 
    "As long as it&#39;s an abstract\ndevice and follow this", 
    "equation, things are fine.", 
    "Notice that this equation here\ndid not say anything about the",

    "supplies power.",

    "that can amplify power.", 
    "In other words, if it&#39;s not a\npassive device, it is a device", 
    "that can amplify power\nor can supply power.",

    "behavior will be observed.", 
    "There are no surprises.",

    "The mathematically observed\nbehavior will be seen.", 
    "No surprises there.", 
    "But the VCCS must\nbe a device--", 
    "our dependent source must be\na device that supply power.", 
    "It must be able to cause V0 to\ngo negative and still be able", 
    "to afford a positive current.", 
    "In other words, it is\nsupplying powet.",

    "not a passive device.",
