    "SPEAKER 1: Good.", 
    "I hope you had a chance to work it out for ourselves, but", 
    "let me go ahead and solve it for you.", 
    "We're trying to find out if the inductor admits a V equals", 
    "IR kind of relationship, much as we saw it for the resistor", 
    "and the capacitor.", 
    "When our currents and voltages are of the form e raised to", 
    "st.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So let me go ahead and try this out.", 
    "So Vl is Vl e raised to st. L di dt is the following.", 
    "IL is IL e raised to st. Then we substitute that,", 
    "and what do I find?", 
    "I get L IL, s e raised to st.", 
    "And so again, I just can't stop singing the praises of", 
    "the exponential form, because it stays very similar to", 
    "itself after being differentiated.", 
    "And so, I can cancel it out, and I'm left with", 
    "VL equals LS IL.", 
    "Easy.", 
    "So let me put a box around it.", 
    "And then this case, LS is known as ZL, or the impedance.", 
    "so ZL is the impedance representation of the", 
    "inductor, and it is given by LS.", 
    "And remember that because s equals j omega, VL is really j", 
    "omega L IL.", 
    "Don't forget that.", 
    "So again, this is just absolutely spectacular, where", 
    "even for the inductor, I now know that VL is some ZL times", 
    "IL, whereas ZL is a generalization of resistance", 
    "called the impedance, and so the inductor, that is given by", 
    "LS, or L j omega.", 
    "But this is just one of those really, really exciting", 
    "moments in 6.002X, and you will see the aha moment in a", 
    "few seconds.", 
    "And this thing is so amazing-- this generalization is so", 
    "amazing-- that if I could sing, I'd", 
    "burst into song here.", 
    "So for the capacitor, what do we have?", 
    "For the capacitor, I'm going to write down complex", 
    "amplitudes here.", 
    "So VC and IC.", 
    "We're creating an impedance model.", 
    "And for the capacitor in the impedance model, you recreate", 
    "the capacitor with a box.", 
    "So this is a box.", 
    "Big surprise.", 
    "This is a box.", 
    "So I replace capacitors, inductors, and resistors with", 
    "boxes, and I write the impedance next to the box.", 
    "Not inductance, not capacitance, not resistance,", 
    "but the impedance.", 
    "And instead of the usual current, I'm going to write", 
    "down the complex amplitudes.", 
    "The complex amplitudes is IC and VC.", 
    "And the relationship between them is given by VC equals ZC", 
    "IC for the capacitor, and the impedance, ZC, is simply one", 
    "by SC, whereas you know, SC is a j omega.", 
    "So ZC is the impedance.", 
    "Similarly for the inductor, I can decorate the little box", 
    "here with the complex amplitude IL, for the current,", 
    "and complex amplitude VL, for the voltage.", 
    "Its impedance is ZL, and then the generalization of Ohms law", 
    "here, VL equals ZL IL, where ZL, the impedance, is SL.", 
    "And don't forget that S is j omega."
