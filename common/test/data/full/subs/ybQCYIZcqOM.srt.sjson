    "SPEAKER: Let me start with the over-damped case as I", 
    "promised, OK?", 
    "The over-damped case is where alpha is", 
    "greater than omega naught.", 
    "And because alpha is greater than omega naught here, then 2", 
    "will be less than 1/2, OK?", 
    "This is the over-damped case.", 
    "And as I promised, identical circuits.", 
    "In one case, I'm going to apply a sinusoid at the input", 
    "and measure the frequency response.", 
    "I'm going to measure the magnitude of Vc/Vi, the", 
    "magnitude of the transfer function for", 
    "the frequency response.", 
    "For the time domain part, I'm going to apply a unit step.", 
    "And I'm going to observe for what VC looks like.", 
    "So again, let's get this very clear, so there's no confusion", 
    "whatsoever.", 
    "For the frequency response, I'm going to look at the", 
    "magnitude of the transfer function, Vc/Vi, take the", 
    "magnitude of that as a function of frequency.", 
    "In the time domain, I'm going to plot something completely", 
    "different, OK?", 
    "This really has nothing to do with the transfer function.", 
    "I'm going to plot VC exactly as is, so we can look at what", 
    "it looks like for a unit step.", 
    "And the main goal of this analysis is to give you some", 
    "insight into how certain kinds of frequency domain behaviors", 
    "relate to time domain behaviors, OK?", 
    "So don't get confused.", 
    "I'm using a sinusoid as input here for a", 
    "frequency domain analysis.", 
    "I'm using a unit step here for a time domain analysis, OK?", 
    "So it's really not comparing apples and apples.", 
    "It's really apples and oranges.", 
    "But I think it's sufficient to give us a lot of insight.", 
    "All right, so the under-damped case for the frequency domain", 
    "analysis, we've seen this before.", 
    "So given that the capacitor is a open circuit for low", 
    "frequencies, I get a low-pass filter, OK?", 
    "Pretty straightforward.", 
    "The break frequency or the cutoff frequency is at omega", 
    "naught for this filter.", 
    "And given that it's a low-Q situation--", 
    "the low-Q situation, Q is less than half--", 
    "I don't get any peaky behavior, all right?", 
    "And so I simply get 1 here because the capacitor behaved", 
    "like an open circuit for low frequencies and like a short", 
    "circuit for high frequencies.", 
    "And so I get my low-pass filter, OK?", 
    "It's a pretty straightforward low-pass", 
    "filter, no peaky behavior.", 
    "Next, let's look at the time domain", 
    "behavior for a unit step.", 
    "And again, I'm going to repeat this one more time.", 
    "It's for unit step.", 
    "It's not a sinusoid.", 
    "So for the unit step--", 
    "you've seen this before for a RLC circuit-- we're observing", 
    "the voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "For a unit step, I'm going to get something that", 
    "looks like this, OK?", 
    "So if VC is a unit step, then I'm going to get a 1 here.", 
    "And I'm going to get a rising waveform that looks like this.", 
    "The reason this is the case is that the capacitor--", 
    "initially, let's say the capacitor has zero volts on", 
    "it, zero charge.", 
    "And so the capacitor voltage is initially zero.", 
    "And then, as the unit step happens, the capacitor gets", 
    "more and more charged in the following manner.", 
    "And eventually, it would be like a long-term open circuit.", 
    "And all the voltage drop is falling across the capacitor.", 
    "OK, so Vi, which is 1 times u of t, ultimately falls all", 
    "across the capacitor.", 
    "The capacitor becomes an open circuit.", 
    "And this is what I get, OK?", 
    "So you've seen the time domain behavior.", 
    "And you've seen the frequency domain behavior now.", 
    "So the frequency domain behavior, it looks like a", 
    "low-pass filter.", 
    "It's low-Q, no peakiness.", 
    "And at the time domain, I get a pretty sluggish circuit, OK?", 
    "It just goes up lazily and saturates at [? unit D ?]", 
    "OK?", 
    "You've seen this before.", 
    "This is the over-damped case.", 
    "Next, let's look at the under-damped case."
