    "So what I&#39;d like to do is, I&#39;d\nlike to plot V0 versus VI,", 
    "given this expression.", 
    "So I like to plot V0 versus Vi\nfor of these parameter values.", 
    "Because I&#39;m going to pick VS to\nbe 10 volts, my dependent", 
    "source parameter, K, to be 2\nmilliamps per volt squared.", 
    "And I&#39;ll pick RL to be 5\nkiliohms. So this was none", 
    "other than the starred\nequation on", 
    "the previous slide.", 
    "So that&#39;s my V0 versus\nVI equation.", 
    "And what I&#39;ll do next is I&#39;ll\nsubstitute the values above", 
    "into this equation,\nand I get this.", 
    "You can notice, for VS,\nI&#39;ve substituted 10.", 
    "So K is 2 milliamps.", 
    "So if I substitute K to be 2,\nthe 2 and 2 cancel out.", 
    "If RL is 5 kiliohms, then\nI get my 5 here.", 
    "And then I have VI minus\n1 all squared up there.", 
    "So let&#39;s plot this equation and\nsee what it looks like.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and do that.", 
    "So we&#39;ve done this\nonce before.", 
    "So this should not be\na big surprise.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to start with\nthe 10 volts here.", 
    "And notice that, as long as VI\nis less than 1 volt, then my", 
    "VO is going to be VS. So VO is\ngoing to be VS, which is 10", 
    "volts for a VI less\nthan 1 volt.", 
    "Again, this is true for VI\ngreater than equal to 1 volt.", 
    "So for VI less than 1, I get a\nflat part of the curve here,", 
    "where V0 is equal to 10 volts.", 
    "Then as I increase the value\nof VI, then notice that the", 
    "curve begins to drop\nrather sharply.", 
    "Because I&#39;m subtracting the\nsquare of VI from 10 volts.", 
    "And so I get a curve that is\ngoing to drop down like this.", 
    "So where is the amplification\nhere?", 
    "So notice, if I focus on, say,\nthis part of the curve, if I", 
    "focus on this part of the curve,\nthen notice that for a", 
    "small change in VI, let&#39;s call\nthat delta VI, notice that", 
    "I&#39;ve got myself a fairly\nlarge change VO.", 
    "So I get a fairly large\nchange in VO, which I", 
    "will call delta VO.", 
    "So for a small change in VI,\nwhich articulates this part of", 
    "the curve, I&#39;m going to get\na large change in VO.", 
    "In other words, delta VO divided\nby delta VI, as you", 
    "can see from this graph,\nis greater than 1.", 
    "And this implies\namplification.", 
    "So if I can somehow take my\ninput signal and boost it to", 
    "this part of the curve, and you\nknow how to do that now.", 
    "We can apply a DC offset to\nboost the signal to this", 
    "range, here.", 
    "Then you will get that signal\ncausing this part of the", 
    "transfer curve to be active\nand give rise to a voltage", 
    "gain, where a delta VI becomes a\ndelta V0, where the ratio of", 
    "delta V0 by delta VI\nis greater than 1.", 
    "So there&#39;s really not much else\nto do, but let me just go", 
    "and wrap it up for you.", 
    "I can also tabulate V0 versus\nVI, for this equation, so that", 
    "we can look at some numbers\nin more detail.", 
    "And so let me put down\na little column here.", 
    "So when VI is 0, when I\nsubstitute VI to be 0, here,", 
    "then notice that I&#39;m going to\nget my equation being one", 
    "where the VS is 10 volts.", 
    "Recall that this equation was\ntrue when VI was greater than", 
    "equal to 1 volt.", 
    "And I knew that V0 equals VS\nwhen VI was less than 1 volt.", 
    "So as long as VI is less than\n1 volt, I&#39;m going to get 10", 
    "volts at the output.", 
    "So I get 10 volts here.", 
    "So I go on up to 1 volts,\nI get 10 volts again.", 
    "Nothing particularly interesting\nhappening here.", 
    "But notice when I substitute\nVI equal to 1, which is the", 
    "threshold point, I get\nV0 equals 10 volts.", 
    "And that&#39;s not a surprise.", 
    "So what about when VI is 1.5?", 
    "So when VI is 1.5 volts,\nthen I get a 0.5 here.", 
    "And the 0.5 squared is 0.25.", 
    "And 0.25 times 5 is 1.25.", 
    "And if I get a minus sign\nhere, so minus 1.25.", 
    "And 10 minus 1.25\nis 8.75 volts.", 
    "I won&#39;t bore you with\nthe detail.", 
    "And you can go check this\nout for yourselves.", 
    "I can go ahead and\nfill the curve.", 
    "So this is 2 volts.", 
    "I&#39;m going to get 5\nvolts out here.", 
    "If it&#39;s 2.1, I&#39;m going to\nget 4 volts out here.", 
    "If it&#39;s 2.2, I&#39;m going\nto get 2.8 volts.", 
    "If it&#39;s 2.3, I&#39;m going\nto get 1.5 volts.", 
    "And if it&#39;s 2.4, then I get\ndown to almost 0 volts.", 
    "So this is what I have. So right\nhere, you can take a", 
    "look at the value from\n2 volts down to 2.1", 
    "volts for the input.", 
    "Notice that this corresponds\nto 0.1 volt change in VI.", 
    "And, correspondingly, notice\nthat this results in a 1 volt", 
    "change in the output, V0.", 
    "So right there, there\nit is again.", 
    "So notice that in certain parts\nof the curve, here,", 
    "there is a gain, if I&#39;m careful\nas to where I go and", 
    "pick my point boost the\ninteresting part of the curve,", 
    "so that the input will\narticulate that interesting", 
    "part of the curve.", 
    "But before I move on to a couple\nof final points, let me", 
    "show you a quick little demo.", 
    "And in this demo, I&#39;m going\nto show you a circuit that", 
    "behaves similar to the one we&#39;ve\nseen in our discussions", 
    "so far, and do a little demo,\nand show you what the output", 
    "really looks like.",
