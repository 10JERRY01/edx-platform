    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so let me\ngive you the trick.", 
    "How do we become unstuck?", 
    "So the real trick is that,\nremember, we are engineers.", 
    "We are not required to study\nexactly what is.", 
    "Our goal is to build interesting\nsystems.", 
    "We are allowed to make changes\nto the playground.", 
    "Unlike a golfer, who is not\nallowed to change the field in", 
    "the golf course, we,\nas engineers,", 
    "can do what we like.", 
    "At the end of the day, we are\ngiven nature and we have to", 
    "build useful systems. But\nwe can make things true.", 
    "So what we are going to do is\nthat, as electrical engineers,", 
    "we are going to make it true.", 
    "So del q by del t\nwas problematic.", 
    "And the current could be\ndefined if it was 0.", 
    "So, believe it or not, what I\nam going to do is I am going", 
    "to make it 0.", 
    "As an engineer, I am going\nto create a playground.", 
    "I am going to create a\nplayground within this entire", 
    "world of ours.", 
    "And I am going to call it\nthe EECS playground.", 
    "And I want to say that within\nthat playground, you come in", 
    "only if for the elements\ndq by dt is 0.", 
    "So I am going to go ahead and\nmake that assumption so that", 
    "dq by dt is always 0 for the\nelements within that", 
    "playground.", 
    "So if I bring in, for example,\na resistor into the", 
    "playground, I am only allowed\nto bring that resistor in if", 
    "del q by del t equals\n0 for that resistor.", 
    "And if del q by del t was not\nequal to 0, I could not bring", 
    "that resistor into my\nEECS playground.", 
    "Notice, I am making\nthe rules here.", 
    "As engineers, we are making the\nrules and defining an EECS", 
    "playground where, for the\nelements that are allowed to", 
    "come in, we make sure that these\nelements abide by this", 
    "oath, that del q by del t for\nthe element is going to be 0.", 
    "And if not, you are not going\nto be allowed in.", 
    "So now, only those elements for\nwhich dq by dt is 0 are", 
    "allowed into my EECS\nplayground.", 
    "And so suddenly, life\nbecomes simple.", 
    "By definition, by fiat, by\ndictatorial edict, I have made", 
    "sure that only those elements\nfor which dq by dt is 0 is in", 
    "my playground.", 
    "So suddenly and magically, I\nis uniquely defined for all", 
    "the elements within\nthe playground.", 
    "Isn&#39;t this just spectacular?", 
    "What about the voltage?", 
    "So don&#39;t forget that I also had\na voltage redefined for", 
    "the element between A and B,\nthat of the voltage, V. I also", 
    "have to make sure that the\nvoltage, V, is defined.", 
    "I won&#39;t go into details\nof how you do this.", 
    "But suffice it to say that the\nvoltage, VAB, is defined when", 
    "del phi B by del t equals 0.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is--", 
    "now, much like I did for my\nprevious example, I will go", 
    "out and assume that del phi B is\nequal to 0 for the element", 
    "on this slide as well.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do here is,\nagain, assume that del phi", 
    "B by del t becomes 0 and\ngo ahead and make that", 
    "assumption.", 
    "So I&#39;m just going to go ahead\nand assume that, too.", 
    "And by doing so, it turns out\nthat what&#39;s going to happen is", 
    "VAB equals the line integral of\nE dot dl will be true when", 
    "del phi B by del t is\n0, outside elements.", 
    "So it turns out that VAB equals\nthe line integral E dot", 
    "dl when del phi B del\nt equal to 0.", 
    "It&#39;s not true otherwise.", 
    "But when I make that assumption,\nthen VAB will be", 
    "uniquely defined for\nthat element.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is--", 
    "I&#39;m on a roll here.", 
    "So I am going to assume\nthis, too.", 
    "So I am going to go ahead and\nassume that del phi B divided", 
    "by del t is equal to 0\noutside the element.", 
    "And by doing so, in this\nplayground of mine, I get a", 
    "unique current and a voltage\ndefined for the element.", 
    "There&#39;s one other assumption\nI have to make.", 
    "Remember, one assumption was\ndel q by del t must be 0.", 
    "And the second assumption is del\nphi B by del t equal to 0", 
    "for all the elements\nin my playground.", 
    "There&#39;s a third that I have to\nmake, which is that the signal", 
    "speeds of interest should\nbe way lower than", 
    "the speed of light.", 
    "So when I build my circuits, the\nsignal speeds of interest", 
    "that I have in my circuit\nmust be way lower than", 
    "the speed of light.", 
    "So for the elements that I bring\ninto the playground and", 
    "for the circuits that I built,\nif these three assumptions--", 
    "one, two, and three--", 
    "if these three assumptions are\ntrue, then my lumped circuit", 
    "model works.", 
    "And I can build very\nsimple circuits.", 
    "As soon as I do that,\nI have nature.", 
    "And I can create this\nEECS playground.", 
    "So all of you, welcome to\nour EECS playground.", 
    "So within this playground,\nwhat have we done?", 
    "We have imposed some constraints\namong ourselves.", 
    "What we have said is that\nyou are allowed in this", 
    "playground.", 
    "Let&#39;s say you are a resistor.", 
    "You want to come into\nthis playground.", 
    "If you want to come into this\nplayground, you have to go and", 
    "talk to the border guard.", 
    "And the border guard is going to\ncheck to see if your del q", 
    "by del t, del phi\nB by del t is 0.", 
    "And as you come in, if you\npromise that your signal", 
    "speeds would be way lower than\nthe speed of light, then they", 
    "will let you in.", 
    "So once you do that, good things\nwill start to happen.", 
    "So the two assumptions we are\ngoing to make inside are del", 
    "phi B by del t equals\n0, del q by del t", 
    "equals 0 inside elements.", 
    "And also that the speed of\nsignals that we care about", 
    "will be way lower than\nthe speed of light.", 
    "And as soon as we do this,\ngood things will happen.", 
    "We will be able to build cool\ndevices such as iPads.", 
    "And this is the foundations\nof video gaming and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "Lots of good things\nwill happen.", 
    "So as a quick summary--", 
    "these self-imposed constraints\nare called the lumped matter", 
    "discipline or LMD.", 
    "Remember that this is\nnot true in general.", 
    "All we&#39;ve done is create\nthe EECS playground.", 
    "And we said, we are\ngoing to impose a", 
    "discipline on ourselves.", 
    "Inside the playground, we are\nonly going to bring in", 
    "elements for which del phi B\nby del t equals 0, del q by", 
    "del t equals 0.", 
    "And we also are going to swear\nthat the speeds of signals of", 
    "interest to us will be way lower\nthan the speed of light.", 
    "And these are the tenets of the\nlumped matter discipline.", 
    "You can read more about this in\nchapter one of A and L and", 
    "also in appendix one.", 
    "Now, the moment you abide by\nthis discipline and you use", 
    "this lumped elements which\nfollow this discipline, then", 
    "if you take these lumped\nelements and then you connect", 
    "them up with ideal wires to form\nan assembly, then that", 
    "will result in the lumped\ncircuit abstraction.", 
    "So for example, if you take\na resistor and you take a", 
    "voltage source and you connect\nthem up and you build a", 
    "circuit where these\nare ideal wires.", 
    "And your lumped elements, your\nbattery and the resistor, are", 
    "lumped elements that abide by\nthe lumped matter discipline.", 
    "Then circuits such as this\nthat you build are called", 
    "lumped circuits.", 
    "The lumped circuit abstraction\nwill give us some very, very", 
    "simple and powerful\ntechniques.", 
    "Truly, believe me when I tell\nyou that you will be able to", 
    "discard the use of Maxwell&#39;s\nequations and instead simply", 
    "use some very, very simple\nalgebraic equations to be able", 
    "to solve even complicated\ncircuits.",
