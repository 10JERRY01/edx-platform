    "SPEAKER: So one question to ask ourselves is how do we", 
    "actually go about operating in the saturation region?", 
    "So we've said so far that if I operate my MOSFET such that it", 
    "is in saturation, good things will happen.", 
    "It is going to behave like a decent current source.", 
    "Now the question is in this amplified", 
    "connection shown here.", 
    "How do I make sure that the MOSFET is in saturation?", 
    "What sort of a connection do I make?", 
    "What input do I apply?", 
    "Well let's take a look at this graph here.", 
    "So this is my zero.", 
    "And I plotted the v0 versus Vi for the MOSFET.", 
    "And recall this is the region in which I need to operate.", 
    "And in this region the transfer curve of the MOSFET", 
    "is given by this equation here.", 
    "Now the question for us is what do I physically have to", 
    "do to make the MOSFET operate in this region?", 
    "How do I hold the MOSFET by the hand and lead it down the", 
    "path of saturation region operation?", 
    "Well they've seen this before.", 
    "The way I move the MOSFET to operate in this region here--", 
    "so if this is the saturation region,", 
    "then my input voltage--", 
    "it needs to articulate about this interval here, where", 
    "remember this point was given by Vt.", 
    "And this point was calculated at the point where V0 was", 
    "equal to Vi minus Vt.", 
    "And below was the region where V0 was less than Vi minus Vt.", 
    "So how do I operate in this region?", 
    "Well you've seen this before.", 
    "It's not a big deal.", 
    "I have to find a way to boost my signal.", 
    "And remember boost. I need to find a way to boost my input", 
    "signal such that the signal of interest operates in this", 
    "range here.", 
    "Let me call that DC bias, or the boosting signal, Vr.", 
    "And the way I do this is I make my connection as follows.", 
    "So I have my voltage source here.", 
    "And I apply a Vi.", 
    "By applying a DC value--", 
    "so this is a DC value--", 
    "I boost any signal to the range here--", 
    "to this range.", 
    "And then what I'm going to do is then I'm going to apply my", 
    "signal of interest. And why don't I call my signal of", 
    "interest Va.", 
    "It is some signal, Va.", 
    "That's the one of interest. So now by doing so, my signal Va", 
    "is going to be applied to about this point.", 
    "And that's going to be my Va.", 
    "So by doing so, I make sure that my signal of interest is", 
    "now operating in the saturation region here.", 
    "Let me also mark my interesting signal so it's", 
    "very clear.", 
    "Let me write that down as my interesting signal.", 
    "So just as an example, what I might do is apply some input", 
    "voltage of interest here.", 
    "So let's say I could pick a triangular wave. And I could", 
    "apply an input that looked like this.", 
    "So that is my time axis.", 
    "So I could apply an input signal that looks like a", 
    "triangular wave.", 
    "And notice that this input signal is carefully chosen", 
    "such that it does not go outside the bounds of", 
    "saturation region operation.", 
    "So what does the output look like for something like this?", 
    "Well, let's see.", 
    "So let's take this point.", 
    "So at the voltage that the input is here, my", 
    "corresponding output is here.", 
    "So I get some voltage here.", 
    "Then when my input is somewhere in the middle, I get", 
    "a value here.", 
    "And so after a small delta in time, I get a voltage that is", 
    "roughly here.", 
    "And then finally for its high value here, I get a", 
    "voltage down here.", 
    "So that will appear down here.", 
    "Now if you were to plot this out against this curve, this", 
    "is what you would get.", 
    "This is what you would get.", 
    "So notice that in this particular situation, two", 
    "things are of interest. First of all, notice", 
    "that I get an inversion.", 
    "There's an inversion happening here.", 
    "The inversion is happening because this curve has an", 
    "inversion associated with it.", 
    "Notice the minus sign up here in this equation.", 
    "And that causes my output to be an", 
    "inverted form of the input.", 
    "That's the first point.", 
    "And the second point is that I get a fair bit of distortion.", 
    "Notice that it doesn't quite look like a triangular wave.", 
    "It kind of does.", 
    "But really one has to be nuts to think of this as", 
    "triangular.", 
    "It's very heavily distorted.", 
    "Well we'll need to figure out what to do about that.", 
    "But we do notice that I was able to operate the amplifier", 
    "in my saturation region.", 
    "And I did so by boosting my signal with the DC value into", 
    "the saturation regime.", 
    "So let's proceed down this path a little further and try", 
    "to make some sense of this.", 
    "One interesting fact to observe is that although I am", 
    "operating in my saturation region given by this, I am", 
    "seeing a lot of distortion in my signal.", 
    "And so I can plot my input and output signals like so, if", 
    "this is my time.", 
    "And I had chosen a triangular wave for Vi", 
    "that looked like this.", 
    "And the corresponding V0 that I got was an inverted form.", 
    "But it was highly distorted.", 
    "It looked something like this.", 
    "And that's how it went.", 
    "And the problem with that was it was highly distorted.", 
    "I should be careful to draw it such that the peak here", 
    "corresponds to this peak.", 
    "So these peaks should correspond.", 
    "It's an inversion of the wave form there.", 
    "So this is how it is.", 
    "So notice that I do see an amplification.", 
    "I mean clearly the V0 has a bigger swing that Vi.", 
    "So it amplifies for sure.", 
    "It amplifies all right.", 
    "But the problem is that it distorts.", 
    "The signal is quite distorted.", 
    "And that is a real problem.", 
    "So my amplifier is linear.", 
    "And of course the question remains how do I go about", 
    "getting a linear amplifier?", 
    "So so far I've built you an amplifier.", 
    "But it is non-linear--", 
    "not quite what I want.", 
    "However I think I can go and build a linear amplifier.", 
    "And we'll look at that in the next few minutes.", 
    "Before we go there though I am going to show you an little", 
    "demonstration.", 
    "So in this demonstration I'm going to apply a few steps.", 
    "I am going to first apply some offset.", 
    "I'm going to start by applying some offset to my input.", 
    "And then what I would do is I'm going to show you what the", 
    "output looks like and show you that it", 
    "is going to be distorted.", 
    "I'm also going to change it a little bit and", 
    "then apply no offset.", 
    "And you would see that the output would be terrible.", 
    "There wouldn't be any amplification.", 
    "And it would be really, really bad.", 
    "And then I will apply a large offset.", 
    "And you will see that again the output", 
    "will look pretty terrible.", 
    "So notice that when I have no offset, then this is my", 
    "operating point.", 
    "And so I will be exercising this part of the curve.", 
    "So that's not a good thing.", 
    "If I apply too much offset, then I'll be excising this", 
    "part of the curve, which is also not interesting.", 
    "Of course when I apply the right amount of offset, then I", 
    "will be in the saturation region of the MOSFET.", 
    "And reasonable things will happen.", 
    "It still will be non-linear, but pretty reasonable.", 
    "So let's get into the demo."
