    "SPEAKER 1: All right, so at this point, I would not be", 
    "surprised if there was some confusion out there.", 
    "We've gone through several ways of looking at a MOSFET.", 
    "We've looked at the switch model, the switch-resistant", 
    "model, the switch current source model.", 
    "And you must be thinking, oh my gosh, when", 
    "do I use which model?", 
    "What's going on here?", 
    "How can a single device behave in different ways?", 
    "And it's really very simple.", 
    "The reason it is simple is that fundamentally, if you", 
    "recall, I am dealing with three voltage.", 
    "There's a VGS I'm dealing with, there's a VDS I'm", 
    "dealing with.", 
    "And then there's a current, IDS.", 
    "Now because I'm dealing with high voltages, it turns out", 
    "that the master behavior depends on both VGS and VDS.", 
    "So take a look.", 
    "So we started with S model, the switch model, a very", 
    "simple model.", 
    "We said, look, I want to approximate the MOSFET", 
    "behavior as open switch and a closed switch,", 
    "a very simple model.", 
    "And then we said, well, there's some resistance", 
    "associated with the MOSFET in that it's on state And so it's", 
    "an off switch here, it's an on switch here.", 
    "And it turns out that in all the cases that we looked at", 
    "where we modeled the MOSFET with the SR model, it turned", 
    "out that the voltage across the drain terminal and the", 
    "source terminals was very small.", 
    "If you recall, digital circuits, I built circuits", 
    "that looked like this where I had a resistor, RL, a supply,", 
    "and when MOSFET was in its on state--", 
    "in other words, when the GS was high, this was on.", 
    "When it was on, I connected the output--", 
    "I had pretty much a short circut from the output to", 
    "ground, and possibly through a resistance, R on, and so my", 
    "voltage, V out, was very low.", 
    "And generally, because the voltage was low, I was", 
    "operating in some region here, and so this was a reasonable", 
    "approximation for my MOSFET.", 
    "So not surprisingly, for digital designs, as we just", 
    "looked at it, the SR model is quite sufficient.", 
    "When the MOSFET is in its off state, then it works like an", 
    "off switch.", 
    "With the MOSFET in its on state, generally the voltages", 
    "are such that the SR model is a reasonable model to apply.", 
    "So I went there and applied my SR model for on-state MOSFETs", 
    "and digital circuits.", 
    "So in 6.002x, for digital circuits we are going to be", 
    "using the SR models.", 
    "So unless we tell you explicitly, you will always", 
    "use the SR models for doing digital designs.", 
    "We also looked at the current source model, where when VGS", 
    "was greater than VT and VDS was greater than VGS minus VT,", 
    "then I was in this region, in the saturation region, to the", 
    "right-hand side of this curve here.", 
    "I was on the right-hand side of that curve, and the", 
    "saturation region behavior of the MOSFET applied.", 
    "This is with the increasing VGS.", 
    "In that case, we notice that the current source model of", 
    "the MOSFET applied.", 
    "And given by the square law behavior, we call", 
    "that the SCS model.", 
    "And we are going to use that as a dependent source for all", 
    "our analog designs.", 
    "So unless you are explicitly told otherwise, which I", 
    "believe we are not going to do, for digital designs you", 
    "will use the SR model.", 
    "For analog designs, you will use the SCS model.", 
    "So again, when do you use each model for 6.002x?", 
    "Very simple.", 
    "For digital designs, the SR model, and for analog designs,", 
    "the SCS model.", 
    "And there, we will use the MOSFET as the dependent", 
    "current source in our designs.", 
    "Note, of course, that when you use the MOSFET for analog", 
    "designs, you have to make sure that the saturation region", 
    "operation applies, that MOSFET is, indeed, in", 
    "its saturation region.", 
    "Otherwise, this is not going to apply.", 
    "We will spend a lot more time thinking about exactly that", 
    "point in a few seconds.", 
    "Now before we move on to analyzing MOSFET amplifiers", 
    "and other such circuits, I want to take a couple seconds", 
    "and give you a slightly different perspective, which", 
    "is that what I told you so far is how we're going to use", 
    "MOSFETS in 6.002x.", 
    "SR model for digital designs, and then SCS", 
    "model for analog designs.", 
    "In the more advanced courses in the future, you have many", 
    "more choices.", 
    "One thing that you might do to get more accurate design is", 
    "you may use a combination of the SR and SCS models.", 
    "So in your circuit, if you find that the VDS is low, then", 
    "you go ahead and use the SR model.", 
    "But for regions where you find VDS is", 
    "high, use the SCS model.", 
    "In this case, it would be a piecewise, non-linear model.", 
    "Actually, no.", 
    "It would be a piecewise linear model where you would use the", 
    "SR resistance in the triode region and you would use the", 
    "current source in the saturation region.", 
    "So you could use a piecewise linear model with the", 
    "resistance and the current source in different regions,", 
    "depending on which applied.", 
    "So here you would use the resistance, and here you would", 
    "use the current source.", 
    "That would be one approach to doing it in future courses,", 
    "but not 6.002x.", 
    "Just to be clear, not in 6.002x.", 
    "The textbook will also describe a different model, a", 
    "more involved model of the MOSFET called the SU model,", 
    "the Switch Unified model.", 
    "For those interested, you can go look at", 
    "section 7.8 of the textbook.", 
    "And here, it is a single model that works across all of these", 
    "regions, and you can look at that as well in the more", 
    "advanced courses.", 
    "But again, to be very clear, all of this is not in 6.002.", 
    "We're going to keep it very simple.", 
    "We're going to use SR for digital, straight resistance", 
    "of the on state, and SCS, which is a straight current", 
    "source, in on the on state for analog designs."
