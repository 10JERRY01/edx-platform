    "SPEAKER 1: Now let's do some really, really fun stuff.", 
    "What we're going to see is that, by using some intuition,", 
    "I want to show you how you can plot the responses to various", 
    "inputs, and in this case, an input that goes to Vi at time", 
    "t equals 0 for a given initial condition.", 
    "And I'm going to show how you can plot these responses", 
    "completely by inspection, OK?", 
    "So much so that you can say bye-bye", 
    "differential equations.", 
    "It's important that you know how to solve differential", 
    "equations, and you have the basic foundations behind it.", 
    "But practitioners in the field oftentimes do not resort to", 
    "different equations at the drop of a hat.", 
    "Rather, they look at the circuit, and they can write", 
    "down by inspection what various outputs look like, OK?", 
    "So I'm going to show you some of these key techniques, some", 
    "of these intuitive approaches to solving these circuits, and", 
    "so that you can very quickly sketch out these responses", 
    "without having to worry too much about what the details of", 
    "the differentials equations are that", 
    "enabled you to get this.", 
    "OK, so here is my same little circuit again.", 
    "I'm telling you that the DC value of the input is VI at", 
    "time t equals 0.", 
    "And the initial condition is V0 on the capacitor.", 
    "Now, in the past when we did these examples based on the", 
    "relative values of VI and V0, you saw a", 
    "couple of things, OK?", 
    "A first-order circuit with a capacitor or an inductor, but", 
    "actually, pretty boring.", 
    "The waveforms looked either like this, or the waveforms", 
    "looked like this.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "There were two kinds of waveforms, either an", 
    "exponential decay, like as shown here, or a rise that", 
    "looked like this.", 
    "For a waveform that went like this, it is easy to see that", 
    "the expression for that is of the form 1 minus e raised to", 
    "the minus t by Rc, where Rc is the usual time constant and t", 
    "is the time.", 
    "And so waveforms like this that rise up in this manner", 
    "are of the type 1 minus e raised to minus t by Rc.", 
    "And waveforms that are like this are exponential, and", 
    "these look like--", 
    "waveforms like this are of the form e to the", 
    "minus t by Rc, OK?", 
    "So waveforms that decay like this for these first-order", 
    "circuits, whether capacitive or inductive, decay as e to", 
    "the minus t by Rc, or they reflect a 1 minus an", 
    "exponential decay, which looks like this.", 
    "It shows a rise up to some constant value.", 
    "So really, there's two forms.", 
    "So by and large, if someone shows you a circuit, a", 
    "first-order circuit, and says, hey, show me what the output", 
    "looks like at one of these points, of course, not at the", 
    "voltage source, but one of the most interesting points, then", 
    "a good guess is to go [SHICK]", 
    "or [SHOOK].", 
    "You can either go to it exponentially or go up as 1", 
    "minus e to the minus t over Rc.", 
    "There are just two forms. That's it.", 
    "So no matter what you're given, you have a 50% chance", 
    "of being correct.", 
    "So all I have to show you now is for a given circuit, which", 
    "one do you pick?", 
    "Do you pick this, or do you pick this?", 
    "That's it.", 
    "That's all there is to it.", 
    "So let's do this example.", 
    "And for this example, I've shown you just a circuit, and", 
    "this is the equation you've seen several times now.", 
    "So let me start by plotting a little graph here.", 
    "So this is time, This is vc, and this is t equals 0.", 
    "OK, so let me start with the case where we VI is--", 
    "let's say, for example, VI is greater than V0.", 
    "So let me choose blue here.", 
    "OK, that's blue.", 
    "And let me choose this example here, OK?", 
    "And let me show you how you can very quickly plot the", 
    "answer when VI is greater than V0.", 
    "So when VI is greater than V0,", 
    "intuitively we know the following.", 
    "Given that my initial condition is V0, I know that", 
    "the world for the capacitor starts at V0.", 
    "That's done.", 
    "I know that.", 
    "Second, if you look at the physical nature of the circuit", 
    "here, notice that if VI is larger than vc, that current", 
    "is going to flow in this direction.", 
    "I'm going to have VI being a DC value.", 
    "It's going to drive current into the capacitor, and vc is", 
    "going to charge up and is going to keep charging until", 
    "the capacitor value is going to equal the input voltage.", 
    "So if this is VI, then after a long period of time, the", 
    "capacitor voltage is going to be at VI.", 
    "Let me write that down here.", 
    "The capacitor voltage is going to be out there.", 
    "And then, so I picked the initial value, and I picked", 
    "the final value from-- completely from intuition.", 
    "And then, I just have to go and pick either", 
    "this one or this one.", 
    "And in this case, given that VI is greater V0, boom, I", 
    "picked this one, and I'm done.", 
    "That was easy.", 
    "I find the initial value, which I'm given.", 
    "And the final value, I look at the circuit, and I can tell", 
    "that in the steady state the capacitor is going to charge", 
    "up and is going to keep charging until vc equals VI.", 
    "And when that happens, it's going to stop charging up, and", 
    "that will be its steady-state value.", 
    "So in that sense, after a long period of time, the capacitor", 
    "looks like an open circuit.", 
    "So in other words, this vc is indistinguishable from whether", 
    "this was an open circuit--", 
    "the capacitor was an open circuit, or whether it was", 
    "fully charged to vc because no current would be flowing in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "Even if this was an open circuit in place of the", 
    "capacitor, the voltage here would be vc.", 
    "So capacitors behave like-- let me write that down here--", 
    "long-term open circuits.", 
    "Once they are fully charged up, they look", 
    "like they're open.", 
    "Once their voltage equals that of the input, they don't--", 
    "you can't pump anymore current through them.", 
    "And so from that same-- because the potential", 
    "difference goes to 0, and they look like a", 
    "long-term open, OK?", 
    "So I picked the first point here.", 
    "This is my first step one.", 
    "I picked the initial value.", 
    "Step two, I pick the final value", 
    "completely from intuition.", 
    "And then as step three, I just pick either this or this.", 
    "And in this case, it's VI is higher than V0.", 
    "Boom, I picked this.", 
    "And I also know that the time constant for this--", 
    "I can write this down-- time constant tau equals Rc.", 
    "All this is saying is that the form of the equation is such", 
    "that I'm going to see an e to the minus t over Rc out there.", 
    "The equation itself can be written as follows.", 
    "So vc equals what?", 
    "So I know I'm going to have a 1 minus e to the minus t over", 
    "Rc in there somewhere.", 
    "I know I'm going to do that.", 
    "I'm going to have that because this form is 1 minus e raised", 
    "to minus t over Rc.", 
    "Now, with a form like this, notice that time t equals 0.", 
    "This is 0.", 
    "So this expression here starts off at 0, and the time t", 
    "equals infinity goes to 1.", 
    "So this equation starts off at 0 and goes to 1 at time t", 
    "equals infinity.", 
    "So in this case, I start off not at 0, but I start off at", 
    "V0, and I end up at VI.", 
    "So what I can write here intuitively is I have a VI", 
    "minus V0 out here.", 
    "So it's this difference here.", 
    "It's that difference over which the capacitor voltage is", 
    "going to rise.", 
    "In other words, just this expression here is multiplied", 
    "by 1, which is the difference between these two.", 
    "So if I write down the difference between the final", 
    "value and the initial value, that's what I get here.", 
    "So at time t equals 0, notice that this whole thing is 0.", 
    "And at time t equals infinity, it goes to VI minus V0.", 
    "So then, notice since that time t equals 0, this whole", 
    "thing is 0.", 
    "I need to make this is equal V0 at times t equals 0, so I", 
    "just put V0 out here.", 
    "So vc is given by this expression, which intuitively", 
    "explains how this waveform behaves.", 
    "And I will let you play around with this equation and", 
    "convince yourself that these two are the same.", 
    "You can develop this equation directly from this equation.", 
    "The two are identical.", 
    "You can develop this equation purely using algebra from the", 
    "equation above.", 
    "I've developed it completely using intuition.", 
    "And the reason I like to write it this way is the following.", 
    "Initial value is V0, so that is the initial value.", 
    "And then, this piece here governs this part.", 
    "So I take V0, which is this part here.", 
    "And I add to that this increase of VI minus V0 times", 
    "1 minus e raised to minus t divided by Rc, which is this", 
    "second piece here."
