    "SPEAKER: Now let me do a second order circuit for you.", 
    "And remember, we are only looking for the steady state", 
    "sinusoidal response.", 
    "So a sinusoidal steady state response which we often", 
    "shorthand as SSS.", 
    "So I'm going to draw the circuit for which I want the", 
    "sinusoidal steady state response.", 
    "So I'm looking for something like this.", 
    "So I want my circuit--", 
    "I have an inductor.", 
    "I have a capacitor.", 
    "I have a resistor.", 
    "And I close my circuit like this-- my inductance L,", 
    "capacitance C, resistance R.", 
    "And I can go ahead and do the boxes for you.", 
    "Oftentimes I may even ignore that and just--", 
    "I know that I have boxes.", 
    "So let me go ahead and pretend I have the boxes for", 
    "impedances.", 
    "So here's my complex amplitude Vi.", 
    "I And notice that Vi is really the complex amplitude of the", 
    "drive Vi e raised to st. And notice that I can get the real", 
    "input drive to Vi cosine omega t, which will be the real part", 
    "off Vi e raised to st.", 
    "So let's say here that I care about finding out the voltage", 
    "across the resistor, VR.", 
    "Notice I'm playing a little fast and loose here.", 
    "Technically I should have drawn all the impedance boxes", 
    "for ZL and so on.", 
    "But I'm just doing a quick little shorthand here and", 
    "going and using my amplitudes, knowing full well that this is", 
    "a impeded circuit that I'm talking about.", 
    "So the voltage VR across the resistor--", 
    "what that really means is that VR is the complex amplitude,", 
    "VR e raised to st. And from that I can find--", 
    "once I find VR--", 
    "know that the reason I can stop there and not worry", 
    "further is that I can find out the time domain response very", 
    "quickly as follows-- cosine omega t angle VR.", 
    "So oftentimes we completely skip this final step and", 
    "simply go ahead and figure out what VR is, knowing that by", 
    "looking at these two steps, I can figure out", 
    "the time domain response.", 
    "So what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to go ahead and", 
    "find VR for yourself in terms of Vi, the input amplitude,", 
    "and the various values of L, C, and R. Remember you have to", 
    "replace L,C, and R with their impedances.", 
    "So impedance ZL will be sL.", 
    "Impedance for C for will be ZC is 1 by sC.", 
    "And the impedance for R will simply be R itself.", 
    "So go ahead and try that out.", 
    "And for this example, I'm not even going to bother trying to", 
    "solve the differential equation to find out the", 
    "sinusoid using our first method.", 
    "It would be a second order differential equation.", 
    "And I promise you the sines and cosines would be", 
    "[? ifty ?].", 
    "For the first order RC, those were nightmarish.", 
    "For the second order, it would be pretty unthinkable.", 
    "So go ahead and directly try the impedance model.", 
    "Find VR using the impedance model in the next exercise.", 
    "And then I will come back and go ahead and solve it once", 
    "you've had a chance to try it out in the exercise."
