    "SPEAKER 1: To continue with our review, let's play around", 
    "with impedances for a little longer.", 
    "And as you recall, impedances analyze like resistance.", 
    "OK?", 
    "No differential equations.", 
    "No trick.", 
    "So for example, so just as this circuit here-- let me", 
    "just draw a circuit.", 
    "Let's take a couple of resistors.", 
    "And let's say this little branch is called AB.", 
    "Let's say the current of this branch is IAB.", 
    "And the voltage between A and B is denoted VAB.", 
    "And let's say the two resistances are R1 and R2.", 
    "And then we know that R between the two ends of the", 
    "branch, RAB is VAB divided by IAB.", 
    "And that is simply R1 plus R2.", 
    "OK, it is very easy.", 
    "The resistances simply added up.", 
    "OK, so just as these just added up, the impedance model", 
    "works in the same way.", 
    "And impedances simply add up.", 
    "So for example, if I have something like this.", 
    "OK, so let's say in this case I have a resistor and I have", 
    "an inductor.", 
    "And I label my branch points A and B, resistance R1, and an", 
    "inductor L.", 
    "The Impedance of the inductor is given by j omega L. So", 
    "let's say in the impedance model I deal with complex", 
    "amplitudes.", 
    "So let's say IAB is the complex", 
    "amplitude of the current.", 
    "And VAB is the voltage, is a complex amplitude of the", 
    "voltage across the resistor inductor pair.", 
    "So in this case, the correspondence is that the", 
    "ZAB, the impedance of the combination of the resistor", 
    "and inductor, is VAB divided by IAB.", 
    "It's the ratio of the complex amplitudes VAB and IAB.", 
    "And that is simply the sum of the impedances.", 
    "So the impedance for R is simply R1.", 
    "And the impedance for the inductor is simply j omega L.", 
    "OK, it's very, very simple.", 
    "I simply add up the impedances much like I added up the", 
    "resistances in our very simple resistor model.", 
    "OK, so I can do a slightly more complicated circuit, just", 
    "to show you how easy this is.", 
    "Alright, so let's say this is my point", 
    "A. I have is resistor.", 
    "And let me make things a little bit more complicated by", 
    "sticking a capacitor here, and another resistor here.", 
    "So let's call this R2, let's call this R1, and let's call", 
    "this C.", 
    "And you know what?", 
    "Let's add an inductor here.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So this is AB.", 
    "So in this particular situation I could very quickly", 
    "write down the impedance for A to B. OK, ZAB could very", 
    "quickly be written down as the impedance of R1--", 
    "so ZR1--", 
    "plus the parallel connection of the capacitor and resistor.", 
    "So ZC in parallel with R--", 
    "I should be careful to use the impedance here, although I'm", 
    "sure you understand.", 
    "So the impedance of R2 plus the", 
    "impedance off the inductor.", 
    "OK, that is simple enough.", 
    "So I can go ahead and plug in the values.", 
    "The impedance of R1 is simply R1.", 
    "The impedance of the capacitor is 1 by j omega C. Impedance", 
    "of the resistor is R2.", 
    "And the impedance of the inductor is j omega L.", 
    "OK, so pretty straightforward.", 
    "So now I can go ahead and simplify this a little bit,", 
    "and this becomes R1.", 
    "And 1 by j omega C in parallel with R2 is also very easily", 
    "calculated as follows.", 
    "So recall the parallel connection was simply the", 
    "product of the impedances divided by the sum of the", 
    "impedances.", 
    "OK, so the parallel connection, you take the", 
    "product of the impedances divided by the sum of the", 
    "impedances.", 
    "Plus j omega L. OK, I can simplify this further by", 
    "multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by j omega", 
    "C. I end up with R2 divided by 1 plus j omega R2C plus j", 
    "omega L. OK, again, notice how simple this is.", 
    "In the next exercise that you can jump in and do, we'll give", 
    "you some practice of trying to figure out what the boundary", 
    "values off the impedance might be for low and", 
    "high values of omega.", 
    "OK, so go ahead and try it out in the next exercise."
