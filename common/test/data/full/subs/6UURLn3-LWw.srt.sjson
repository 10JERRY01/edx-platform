    "SPEAKER 1: Now let&#39;s solve a\nsmall circuit analysis example", 
    "using the techniques that\nwe have just learned.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to use the same\nExpo Dweeb device and put that", 
    "into a circuit similar to what\nthat we&#39;ve seen before.", 
    "So here is the circuit that\nI&#39;m going to analyze the", 
    "source, then put VI, and in\nseries with a resistor, R. And", 
    "that is connected to my Expo\nDweeb device, my LED.", 
    "And I have ID and\nVD across it.", 
    "And so let&#39;s assume that, for\nthis Expo Dweeb device, ID", 
    "equals ae raised to b VD.", 
    "So my goal here for this\ncircuit is to find ID.", 
    "Find the small signal, ID,\nfor a small signal, VI.", 
    "Assume that the values are\nset according to these.", 
    "So assume R is 1 ohm.", 
    "Assume a equals 1/4 of an\namp, and b is equal to", 
    "1 volt minus 1.", 
    "Why don&#39;t you go ahead and let&#39;s\nmake an assumption about", 
    "where we set the bias point.", 
    "So also assume that we set\nthe bias point set", 
    "at VI equals 1 volt.", 
    "So here&#39;s the problem.", 
    "So you want to go and solve this\ncircuit with the LED in", 
    "series with the resistance, R.\nThis is our light-emitting", 
    "Expo Dweeb.", 
    "And I&#39;m asking you to find ID,\nthe small signal, ID, for a", 
    "small change in VI.", 
    "And assume the same kinds of\nvalues for R and b that we", 
    "assumed in the previous analysis\nof the same kind of", 
    "nonlinear circuit.", 
    "And do this about the bias\npoint, VI is equal to 1 volt.", 
    "OK, so this is a statement\nof the problem.", 
    "So our goal will be to conduct a\nsmall signal analysis and go", 
    "ahead and solve this problem.", 
    "And we will use a small\nsignal circuit model", 
    "in order to do that.", 
    "Now recall, we had three steps\nof the small signal circuit", 
    "analysis method.", 
    "The first part was to perform\na large signal analysis.", 
    "This would be a nonlinear\nanalysis.", 
    "Then the second step was to\ncreate linearized models for", 
    "each of our elements.", 
    "And then, as a third step, we\nwere going to build a small", 
    "signal circuit and analyze it.", 
    "The small signal circuit would\nhave the linearized model.", 
    "So we go ahead and analyze this\nsmall signal circuit, the", 
    "SS circuit, the small\nsignal circuit.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and go down\nthese three steps, step one,", 
    "step two, and step three,\nand solve this problem.", 
    "OK, let&#39;s start with step one.", 
    "Step one says, build the large\nsignal circuit model and", 
    "analyze it.", 
    "So just to be sure we understand\nwhat&#39;s going on,", 
    "this was our original circuit.", 
    "So this was VD, ID, this\nwas R, and this was VI.", 
    "So for my large signal circuit,\nI simply take the", 
    "same circuit and pick the\noperating point values for the", 
    "inputs in the circuit.", 
    "Also recall that ID is some\nfunction of VD, given by ae", 
    "raised to b VD.", 
    "So let me go ahead and build\nmy large signal circuit--", 
    "so my bias point, voltage VI,\nR stays the same, the LED", 
    "device stays the same.", 
    "And in this case, I get a bias\npoint value for the voltage", 
    "across the device, and a\nbias point current, ID.", 
    "So that is my circuit.", 
    "And here&#39;s my ground node.", 
    "Now, let me go ahead and\nsolve this circuit.", 
    "But let me start by writing\nthe equations for this.", 
    "And I&#39;ll use the analytical\nmethod.", 
    "So according to the analytical\nmethod, I&#39;m going to go ahead", 
    "and write the node equations for\nthis and then solve them", 
    "analytically.", 
    "So my goal here is to find\nout the relationship", 
    "between VD and ID.", 
    "So according to the node method,\nI label this node", 
    "voltage as VD.", 
    "Because I&#39;ve chosen my ground\nnode carefully, my node here", 
    "has voltage, VI.", 
    "So let me go ahead and write\nthe node voltages.", 
    "So here, for the node with\nvoltage, VD, this node has the", 
    "potential VD with respect\nto ground.", 
    "So if I write the node voltage\nfor this, the current in that", 
    "direction is going to be VD\nminus VI divided by R. So it", 
    "is going to be VD minus\nVI, divided by R.", 
    "And then the current exiting\nthis node in this", 
    "direction is ID.", 
    "And ID is given by ae\nraised to b VD.", 
    "So I get ID is ae raised to\nb V D. And the whole thing", 
    "equals 0, according to the\nnode method [? guide, ?]", 
    "because the currents that exist\nthe node are all going", 
    "to sum up to 0.", 
    "Now, recall I&#39;ve asked us to\nsolve the problem for the", 
    "following values, for R equals\n1 ohm, for a equals 1/4 of an", 
    "amp, for b equals\n1 volt inverse.", 
    "And at the bias point,\nat VI equals 1 volt.", 
    "I&#39;m telling that go ahead and\nsolve the problem for VI", 
    "equals 1 volt at the\nbias voltage.", 
    "In general, let me also ask you\nto pick a bias voltage,", 
    "depending on various\nparameters.", 
    "But in this case, I&#39;m going to\ntell you what that voltage is.", 
    "So substituting these\nvalues into the", 
    "equation here, I get VD.", 
    "So R is 1 and VI is 1.", 
    "So this is simply VI minus 1.", 
    "Plus a is 1/4, so I\nwrite that down.", 
    "And then, oops, this\nshould be e.", 
    "So this would be e\nraised to b VD.", 
    "And b is 1, so I simply\nget VD equals 0.", 
    "Now, so I want to solve this\nequation for these parameters.", 
    "And this is the equation that\nI get when I substitute", 
    "for R, a, and b.", 
    "Now, we can go ahead and use\nwhatever technique you like to", 
    "solve this equation, but in\nthis case, we can use a", 
    "numerical method, or we can\nguess and check, or whatever.", 
    "We have done this\nthing before.", 
    "And I&#39;ll just write down\nthe solution here.", 
    "VD is 0.56 volts, and the\ncorresponding ID is 0.44 amps.", 
    "If you recall, I had solved\nthis equation for U in a", 
    "previous sequence.", 
    "And let me just go and write\ndown the answer.", 
    "So there you have it,\nso that is step one.", 
    "I&#39;ve done a nonlinear analysis\nof the large signal circuit,", 
    "and I&#39;ve computed the bias point\nvalues of VD and ID.", 
    "And the reason I need to get\nthese bias point values is", 
    "that I will have to use these\nvalues to compute the", 
    "incremental or linearized\nmodels for the various", 
    "components in the circuit.",
