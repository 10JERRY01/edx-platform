    "SPEAKER 1: so before I wrap up the small signal circuit view,", 
    "I just want to go over one note of caution.", 
    "In my analysis so far in the examples that I just happen to", 
    "have picked, I had noticed that in most cases--", 
    "in fact in all the cases, I wrote Vi equals Vgs.", 
    "I wrote capital Vi equals Vgs and so on.", 
    "I want to give you a caution that this is not always true,", 
    "OK And I just want to give you an example circuit where Vi is", 
    "not necessarily the same as Vgs.", 
    "OK, so Vi is not the same as Vgs in general in [? MOSFET ?]", 
    "circuits.", 
    "And I want to give you an example circuit that you will", 
    "see in some of your exercises and homework and so on.", 
    "And the single most common mistake I've seen students", 
    "make in this unit is making the mistake of writing Vi when", 
    "they should really be writing Vgs.", 
    "So let me give you a quick example and show you how to be", 
    "very careful.", 
    "So let's say I give you a little circuit", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "In this case, instead of putting the load resistor", 
    "between the drain and the source supply, I put the load", 
    "resistor between the source and the ground, O And I take", 
    "my output V 0 at the source terminal.", 
    "And so here, I connect a Vi.", 
    "So this node has voltage Vi.", 
    "So notice right here that my output is taken from the", 
    "source terminal of the MOSFET.", 
    "And this voltage here plus minus is Vgs between the gate", 
    "and source terminals.", 
    "So in this example, notice that Vgs here is", 
    "not equal to Vi.", 
    "What is Vgs equal to?", 
    "OK, what is Vgs equal to in this example?", 
    "Well, this node voltage is Vi.", 
    "And this is the node potential with respect to ground.", 
    "And here, it is V 0 with respect to ground.", 
    "So therefore, the potential difference between these two", 
    "points, the gate and the source, is Vi minus V 0.", 
    "And similarly, the small signal Vgs will be small", 
    "signal Vi minus small signal V nought.", 
    "So be very careful here.", 
    "And in fact, when you go and do the analysis and you", 
    "replace the elements with their small or large signal", 
    "models, here is what you're going to see.", 
    "If you replaced them with the small signal models, here is", 
    "the circuit you will obtain.", 
    "So I get a small signal Vi.", 
    "So I stick it here.", 
    "I get a small signal Vi.", 
    "And I get a dependent source, and I get", 
    "a resistor to ground.", 
    "That is RL, and here is where I take my output V 0.", 
    "This is my source.", 
    "This is my gate.", 
    "This is my drain.", 
    "And notice that I get a short circuit from the drain to the", 
    "ground because my source Vs has shorted out.", 
    "And so this is the circuit that I get.", 
    "OK, so in this particular situation, Vgs", 
    "V small gs is here.", 
    "So in this case, the current Ids--", 
    "OK, what is ids?", 
    "In this case, the moss-fed ids is Vgs minus", 
    "Vt times small Vgs.", 
    "OK, but I think Vgs you can't go wrong.", 
    "It's just that in this case, Vgs is not equal to Vi.", 
    "In fact, capital Vgs is actually Vi minus V 0.", 
    "And small Vgs in fact is small Vi minus small V 0.", 
    "OK, so if you go and do the analysis and you write node", 
    "equations, you will find the following.", 
    "So for example, if I went ahead and wrote the node", 
    "equation here, then--", 
    "so if I wrote the node equation for the small signal", 
    "model, what would I get?", 
    "I would get V 0 divided by RL is the current going down.", 
    "And the current going up is ids, and that is equal to 0.", 
    "But ids in this case would be given by k times Vgs minus Vt", 
    "times Vgs, OK?", 
    "So it would be Vgs minus Vt times small Vgs.", 
    "And Vgs is Vi minus V 0 minus Vt.", 
    "And then small Vgs would be Vi minus V 0.", 
    "Notice that in this case, ids is given by this expression,", 
    "as always, in terms of Vgs.", 
    "But that Vgs, the operating point value is Vi minus V 0,", 
    "and the small signal Vgs is small Vi minus small V 0.", 
    "So just be super careful, and hopefully you won't go wrong.", 
    "So if we replace this ids with this expression here, you can", 
    "now analyze V 0 in terms of Vi by using this equation here.", 
    "In fact, I encourage you to go and try this out, and you'll", 
    "see something very interesting.", 
    "You will see that--", 
    "convince yourselves that for this little circuit, if GMRL", 
    "is much greater than 1, then you will find that V 0 is more", 
    "or less equal to Vi.", 
    "Go convince yourselves for the small, signal circuit that V 0", 
    "more or less equals Vi when GMRL is much greater than 1.", 
    "This circuit is called a buffer.", 
    "In other words, if I apply a small signal input here, I get", 
    "the same small signal output there, Just that this buffer", 
    "here can supply a lot more current than maybe a previous", 
    "stage may have been able to supply.", 
    "So that's why it's a buffer.", 
    "It can supply more current, but it", 
    "maintains the same voltage.", 
    "Now go and try this out for yourselves."
