    "SPEAKER 1: Good.", 
    "So far I've computed the energy dissipated in the", 
    "resistor in the first time interval T1.", 
    "I call that energy E1.", 
    "So as my next step, let me go ahead and compute the energy", 
    "that is dissipated in T2, the second half of the cycle.", 
    "OK, in T2.", 
    "So in this situation, what I'm going to do is I'm going to", 
    "open switch S1 and I'm going to close switch S2, like I've", 
    "shown here.", 
    "So switch S1 is closed, and I'm going to open switch S2.", 
    "So what is the equivalent circuit in this situation?", 
    "So in this situation, since S1 is open, I can ignore the left", 
    "hand part of the circuit, and here's what I get.", 
    "Here's my capacitance, here is my resistance R2.", 
    "So my switch is here, but the switch behaves like a short", 
    "circuit, so I don't have to show it.", 
    "Here's my capacitance C, here's my resistance R2, and", 
    "let's say that my voltage across the capacitor is vc.", 
    "Pretty simple circuit.", 
    "So let's figure out what the energy dissipated is in T2.", 
    "So this case is actually pretty simple.", 
    "So my situation is the following.", 
    "My capacitor C and R2 are connected as shown.", 
    "vc is the time varying voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "And recall in this situation, I'm going to start life from", 
    "the previous cycle.", 
    "At the end of T1, vc was equal to VS. The capacitor had been", 
    "fully charged at the end of T1.", 
    "So my life in T2 starts with the capacitor voltage being", 
    "VS. So let me write that down.", 
    "Let me also remind you that this was true when T1 was much", 
    "greater than R1C.", 
    "Don't lose sight of that, OK?", 
    "So when T1 is much larger than R1C, the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor was VS. All right.", 
    "So as we also saw previously, the energy that the capacitor", 
    "is starting out with is half C VS squared, because it has a", 
    "capacitance C and a voltage VS across it.", 
    "So let me write that down as well.", 
    "Good.", 
    "So the energy stored in the capacitor is 1/2 C VS squared.", 
    "This case is actually very simple.", 
    "Let's assume again that T2, the second interval, is much", 
    "greater than R2C.", 
    "The time constant here is R2C again.", 
    "And in this case the capacitor starts with VS, and it will", 
    "fully discharge through R2 if T2 is big enough.", 
    "OK, so when the switch is turned on, when S2 is turned", 
    "on, then C will start discharging through R2.", 
    "And if T2 is much greater than R2C, the capacitor will fully", 
    "discharge in time T2.", 
    "So the capacitor with energy half C VS squared across it,", 
    "that capacitor fully discharges.", 
    "If its voltage goes from VS to zero, what's happened here?", 
    "So all the charge across the capacitor, this energy half C", 
    "VS squared fully vanishes.", 
    "The capacitor completely discharges through R2, which", 
    "means what must happen is that all of that energy across the", 
    "capacitor gets burned by the resistor R2.", 
    "In this case, the capacitor is supplying the energy.", 
    "Normally capacitors don't consume energy.", 
    "They can store energy, or they can supply energy.", 
    "They don't dissipate energy.", 
    "So in this case, the energy is supplied by the capacitor, but", 
    "it dissipates in the resistor R2, and fully dissipates", 
    "across it, because the final voltage across the capacitor", 
    "is taken to be 0, because T2 is much greater than R2C.", 
    "So therefore, the energy dissipated in R2 doing the", 
    "interval T2 will be 1/2 C VS squared.", 
    "So this energy that is fully dissipated in the resistor in", 
    "time interval T2, let me call that E2.", 
    "Let me call that E2.", 
    "So E2 is the energy dissipated in the resistor R2 during time", 
    "interval T2.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So what is interesting again is that-- notice E2 is also", 
    "independent of R2.", 
    "E1 was independent of R2, and E2 is also independent of R2.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So both E1 and E2 are independent of R2,", 
    "and both are equal.", 
    "E1 was half C VS squared, and so is E2.", 
    "E2 is 1/2 C VS squared."
