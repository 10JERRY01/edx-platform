    "SPEAKER 1: All right, let&#39;s\nbegin by building a tool chest", 
    "of our analysis techniques.", 
    "But before we begin, it would\nworth while asking the", 
    "question, what does it mean\nto analyze a circuit?", 
    "Well analyzing a circuit simply\nmeans find all the", 
    "element v&#39;s and i&#39;s.", 
    "In other words, find all\nthe branch variables.", 
    "And so what are these\nbranch variables?", 
    "Well if you look at element\nR1, I can write its branch", 
    "variables as plus minus\nv1 here, so the", 
    "voltage across R1.", 
    "And I can assign a current i.", 
    "And for R4, as an example,\nI can say there&#39;s", 
    "v4 and there&#39;s i4.", 
    "And in general I&#39;m pretty free\nto assign voltage and currents", 
    "in any direction.", 
    "But you will notice that I&#39;m\ngoing to follow a discipline", 
    "where I&#39;m going to draw the\ncurrent entering into the", 
    "positive terminal.", 
    "And I will show you why\nin a quick second.", 
    "So as another example, I can\ndefine the element value for v", 
    "for the voltage source.", 
    "The branch variables here would\nbe v0 and a current i0", 
    "going here.", 
    "And so on and so forth\nand I can do the", 
    "same for all the elements.", 
    "So analyzing a circuit really\nmeans go find all the element", 
    "v&#39;s and i&#39;s for the circuit.", 
    "Now we&#39;re ready to start with\nour analysis techniques that", 
    "will go into our tool chest. The\nfirst method that we will", 
    "look at is called a very\nbasic KVL, KCL", 
    "method of circuit analysis.", 
    "And as I mentioned earlier, our\ngoal with circuit analysis", 
    "is to find all the element\nv&#39;s and i&#39;s.", 
    "The KVL, KCL method is\nextremely simple.", 
    "In the first step in this\nmethod, you take your circuit", 
    "and you write down for each\nelement their v-i", 
    "relationships.", 
    "Then, the second step, you pick\nall the nodes and for", 
    "each node you write KCL.", 
    "Then as a third step, you go\nthrough the loops one by one", 
    "and you write KVL for\neach of the nodes.", 
    "Notice that each of these\nequations is a very simple", 
    "equation containing simple\nalgebraic expressions of the", 
    "currents and the voltages.", 
    "Now you&#39;ll end up with lots and\nlots of equations and you", 
    "will have lots of fun\nsolving them.", 
    "Let&#39;s take a look\nat an example.", 
    "So our goal, as I said earlier,\nwas to find all", 
    "elements v&#39;s and i&#39;s.", 
    "Now before we go in and do an\nexample of using the KVL, KCL", 
    "method, I want to spend 30\nseconds telling you about a", 
    "couple of ideas on how to label\nelement v&#39;s and i&#39;s.", 
    "So for example, here&#39;s\nan element, the", 
    "Element e in some circuit.", 
    "And notice it has\na v and an i.", 
    "In general, what we&#39;re going\nto do is we are going to", 
    "follow a little discipline or a\nlittle convention in how we", 
    "assign the voltage\nand currents.", 
    "Specifically, we are going\nto take the current to be", 
    "positive going into the positive\nvoltage terminal", 
    "So in this case, here is the\npositive voltage terminal of", 
    "the Element e.", 
    "And so we&#39;re going to be\nassigning currents to be going", 
    "into the positive voltage\nterminal.", 
    "Now you can do whatever\nyou want, it", 
    "really doesn&#39;t matter.", 
    "You can go and assign currents\nand voltages any which way and", 
    "reverse them and KVL, KCL\nwill simply work.", 
    "It just turns out that in a lot\nof what we do in circuits", 
    "and electronics, it is useful to\nfollow conventions so that", 
    "you don&#39;t make silly\nalgebraic mistakes.", 
    "So whenever you have a choice of\nbeing able to do something", 
    "10 different ways, it is just\ngood to be disciplined and use", 
    "one technique all the\ntime so that you", 
    "just don&#39;t make mistakes.", 
    "Now one benefit of taking the\ncurrent to be going into the", 
    "positive terminal of the element\nis that the power", 
    "consumed by the element, which\nis given by vi, is positive.", 
    "So if you choose your convention\nof the current", 
    "going into the positive\nterminal, then the power", 
    "consumed by the element, vi,\nis going to be positive.", 
    "So this way, or this convention,\nof assigning", 
    "voltage and currents as the\nbranch variables is called the", 
    "associated variables\ndiscipline.", 
    "And again, as with all\ndisciplines, it&#39;s something we", 
    "impose on ourselves,\nit&#39;s a convention.", 
    "We just follow this convention\nto simplify our lives and to", 
    "reduce the chance that we&#39;re\ngoing to make mistakes.", 
    "And if you don&#39;t like this,\ndon&#39;t worry, go ahead, make my", 
    "day, pick different convention\nfor v and i, just be careful.", 
    "If you follow this convention,\nit is less likely you will", 
    "make mistakes.", 
    "Now before we actually begin the\nKVL method, there is one", 
    "more thing that I need to\nquickly cover which is a few", 
    "elements relationships.", 
    "So you have seen resistors\nbefore.", 
    "So for a resistor with the\nresistance value R, the v-i", 
    "relationship is simply\ngiven by v equals iR.", 
    "Where if this is my\nvoltage v, and the", 
    "current i, v equals iR.", 
    "Next, for our voltage source,\nlet me draw out a voltage", 
    "source with voltage\nV0 in this case.", 
    "And let me assign branch\nvariable, v plus v and v, and", 
    "the current i.", 
    "Then the element relationship,\nv is given by V0.", 
    "One of the places where I find\nstudents getting confused is", 
    "the difference between element\nvalues and the", 
    "component value itself.", 
    "So if you look at a voltage\nsource of this sort, V0 is a", 
    "property or this\nvoltage source.", 
    "So if it&#39;s a battery,\nit might supply a", 
    "voltage V0 of 1.5 volts.", 
    "However, when I take this\nvoltage source and I put that", 
    "into a circuit, with the circuit\nit&#39;s going to draw", 
    "some current i and there will\nbe some voltage across it.", 
    "If there&#39;s a resistor, it will\nbe some of the voltage.", 
    "But if I put an ideal voltage\nsource with internal voltage", 
    "V0 and I stick that into a\ncircuit, then the branch", 
    "variable v associated with that\nwill also be equal to V0.", 
    "But in general, that doesn&#39;t\nhave to be true.", 
    "Next, let me go to\na current source.", 
    "In this case, I would define\nmy current source like so.", 
    "I can also apply branch\nvariables v and i.", 
    "And the equation, if the current\nsource supplies a", 
    "current I0, then the element\nrelationship for this is given", 
    "by i equals I0.", 
    "So these are three examples of\nelement relationships for", 
    "resistors, voltage sources,\nand current sources.", 
    "OK, we are done with\nthe preamble.", 
    "We are now all set to dive into\nmethod one of circuit", 
    "analysis, the KVL, KCL method.", 
    "So let&#39;s apply this method\nto the demo circuit", 
    "that we used earlier.", 
    "And let&#39;s see how we can\nfind out all the", 
    "element v&#39;s and i&#39;s.", 
    "Now recall, the KVL, KCL method\nsaid, in fact circuit", 
    "analysis said, that solving a\ncircuit involves finding all", 
    "the element v&#39;s and i&#39;s.", 
    "So why don&#39;t we start this\nexample with labeling all the", 
    "v&#39;s and i&#39;s for our\ndemo circuit.", 
    "OK, so let&#39;s get started and\nvery quickly label all the", 
    "branch variables.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to to follow the\nassociated variable discipline", 
    "in doing that.", 
    "So let me start by labelling\nall the branch variables.", 
    "Let me call this v0, current\nis i0 coming in here.", 
    "Let me call this v1 and let\nme say this is current i1.", 
    "Let me say this is\nv4, current i4.", 
    "Let me say this is v3\nand current i3.", 
    "Let me then say that this guy\nhere is v5 and current is i5.", 
    "In this case, it&#39;s v2 and\nthe current is i2.", 
    "So I have a bunch of branch\nvariables assigned.", 
    "And I also have these branch\nvariables involved with the", 
    "currents and voltages.", 
    "And notice here that in this\nexample I have used the", 
    "associated variable discipline,\nthat I have", 
    "assigned all my currents flowing\ninto the positive", 
    "terminal of each of the assigned\nbranch voltages.", 
    "So here I get 12 unknowns\nin all.", 
    "If we count v0, v1, v2, v3,\nv4, and v5, that&#39;s 6.", 
    "And i0 through i5, that&#39;s\nanother 6, so I have a total", 
    "of 12 unknowns.", 
    "Also notice that is a is a\nnode, b is a node, c is a", 
    "node, and d is a node.",
