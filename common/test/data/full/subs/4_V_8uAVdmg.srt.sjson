    "SPEAKER: Next, let's do the same kind of analysis we did", 
    "for a capacitor with a input source.", 
    "And in this particular situation, look at the", 
    "following little circuit.", 
    "For the capacitor, I had looked at a current source,", 
    "driving some current into a capacitor.", 
    "For an inductor, I have a look at a voltage source.", 
    "So here's my little circuit, my inductance L, and it has a", 
    "voltage v across it.", 
    "This is a current i.", 
    "And let's assume that the inductor has current i of 0 at", 
    "rest. I'm sorry, at t equal to 0.", 
    "In other words, when the inductor starts, when time", 
    "starts for us, the inductor has a current i of 0 flowing", 
    "through it as it's initial condition.", 
    "And the voltage here is v.", 
    "Now let's try to figure out for a given v of t what i of t", 
    "looks like.", 
    "And as an example, let's do something similar to what we", 
    "did with the capacitor.", 
    "I'll assume that we have a nice little pulse like this", 
    "with t and value at its peak capital V.", 
    "Now, given this pulse, let's try to figure out what the", 
    "current through the inductor is going to look like.", 
    "Let me write down some equations for you just to jog", 
    "your memory here.", 
    "L di dt is the voltage across the inductor.", 
    "And the current i, in turn, is 1 by L minus", 
    "infinity to t v dt.", 
    "Those are important relations that you have to remember for", 
    "an inductor.", 
    "OK, so this is time 0, this is time 0.", 
    "So let's get started.", 
    "So clearly at time t equal to 0, we are told that the", 
    "inductor current is i of 0.", 
    "We are told that.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "Let me also mark the points corresponding to t here.", 
    "OK, so nothing's really changing in the circuit here.", 
    "And so therefore, the inductor holds its current i sub 0.", 
    "And the voltage continues to be 0.", 
    "Much like a capacitor which holds its charge, q on itself,", 
    "when the current driven through it is 0 assuming that", 
    "the external connection to it is an open circuit.", 
    "Similarly, in a dual manner for the inductor, when v is 0,", 
    "that is like a short circuit across the inductor.", 
    "And so the inductor must simply sit there holding that", 
    "current i of 0.", 
    "Much like a capacitor holds a voltage across it, the", 
    "inductor will simply a current across it.", 
    "Now, in general, practical inductors have a hard time", 
    "doing this because when you build an inductor out of wire,", 
    "wires have some resistance.", 
    "And so there's always this parasitic resistance contained", 
    "in practical conductors.", 
    "And that will cause some power dissipation to happen and for", 
    "the current to decay.", 
    "But supposing we are an ideal inductor, and people do build", 
    "extremely--", 
    "inductors that are close to ideal and are able to store", 
    "current through those.", 
    "They have some super cool devices and so on that can", 
    "have very low resistance.", 
    "And there the inductor can really sit there and hold a", 
    "current through the inductor, much like the capacitor holds", 
    "a charge when there's nothing connected to it.", 
    "So that's the first step, I get i sub 0.", 
    "So as was my next step, let's see what happens between the", 
    "two points t equals--", 
    "at the point the pulse starts and through", 
    "the end of the pulse.", 
    "Now, given our little equation here, i is equal to 1 by L", 
    "integral v dt, this is very simple.", 
    "So given that v is a constant, then the integral of that must", 
    "be something that looks like a ramp.", 
    "So I haven't told you the value yet, but the integration", 
    "of a constant value for v, in this case will be capital V.", 
    "That integration there will simply cause a ramp to occur", 
    "when I integrate the constant value.", 
    "And once the pulse goes away, then the inductor has a", 
    "current given by this amount here, and that will hold it", 
    "from there on.", 
    "So let's try to find out what this jump is.", 
    "OK, let's try to find out what this increase", 
    "in the current is.", 
    "So that is also pretty straightforward.", 
    "Let me switch my colors here.", 
    "Recall that for a capacitor, my delta q was given by I", 
    "times T. I'll switch back to red for the inductor and for", 
    "an inductor, delta lambda is given by VT.", 
    "Hopefully you recall where that came from.", 
    "If not, let me refresh your memory.", 
    "So recall this comes directly from Maxwell's equations where", 
    "we do know that v is d lambda by dt.", 
    "In other words, the rate of change of flux is the voltage", 
    "across the inductor.", 
    "So here, we're given that v is d lambda by dt.", 
    "Notice that when my v is a constant for a period of time,", 
    "I get something that VT is equal to delta lambda.", 
    "So in this particular situation, t is my delta t.", 
    "It's this duration here.", 
    "And so therefore, v times t is equal to delta lambda.", 
    "So the jump in the current can now be very quickly calculated", 
    "from this change in delta lambda.", 
    "Now I know that lambda equals Li And so therefore, I can", 
    "very quickly get delta i as delta lambda divided by L. So", 
    "that directly follows from that little expression there.", 
    "What this says is that if I get a change in the total flux", 
    "linked of delta lambda, then the change in current is given", 
    "by delta lambda by L directly from here.", 
    "So this is the jump that I'm going to see because of that", 
    "voltage pulse.", 
    "And then, this in turn is simply VT divided by L. So", 
    "remember this is very similar to the ramp that you got with", 
    "the circuit containing a current", 
    "source driving a capacitor.", 
    "There are a couple of interesting things to note", 
    "from what you've seen here, which is that notice that the", 
    "voltage across the inductor jumps from 0 volts to capital", 
    "V volts at this point in time.", 
    "But if you notice the inductor current, the inductor current", 
    "is continuous.", 
    "The inductor current, right after the voltage jumped, is", 
    "virtually i of 0.", 
    "So even though the voltage jumped, the inductor current", 
    "changes much more slowly.", 
    "It then ramps up from that initial value.", 
    "Similarly for capacitors, if you pump a current into a", 
    "capacitor, the capacitor will slowly charge up.", 
    "It certainly doesn't jump with the voltage.", 
    "So what you notice here is that inductors like to hold", 
    "their current constant.", 
    "They don't like to change it very quickly.", 
    "Things change slowly.", 
    "So what this means is that when I apply a voltage jump to", 
    "an inductor, its current pretty much doesn't change.", 
    "It changes very slowly.", 
    "And so let me make a quick note of that, which is that", 
    "inductors like to hold the current the same.", 
    "They don't like to make sudden changes.", 
    "So for continuous input changes, and also for--", 
    "let me say for continuous input and also for", 
    "non-infinite jumps in input, the inductor current will", 
    "change slowly.", 
    "The inductor current will be continuous.", 
    "So this is a key property of these storage devices, whether", 
    "it's inductor or capacitor.", 
    "Similarly, in a capacitor, the capacitor likes to hold onto", 
    "its charge.", 
    "So if I change the current through a capacitor by some", 
    "amount, as long as it's not an infinite jump in the current,", 
    "for a current that changes by some amount and is not", 
    "infinite, the voltage across the capacitor is also going to", 
    "be continuous, much like the inductor current was", 
    "continuous as long as there wasn't an", 
    "infinite jump in the current.", 
    "And in fact, this is a very interesting property of", 
    "inductors and capacitors.", 
    "So what happens if I get a massive current", 
    "change to an inductor?", 
    "OK, so supposing I suddenly pump a big current i through", 
    "the inductor.", 
    "The inductor is holding on to its current and inductor likes", 
    "to hold on to its current.", 
    "So let's say the current through the inductor is", 
    "currently, let's say ix.", 
    "And suddenly, I try to pump a huge current though an", 
    "inductor, let's say iy.", 
    "This is a bigger current than ix.", 
    "I put a current source.", 
    "Bad things happen.", 
    "The inductor looks like an instantaneous open.", 
    "So it looks like an instantaneous open to a", 
    "current change.", 
    "To an external current change.", 
    "So therefore, if you have an inductor, you need to be very", 
    "careful forcing a change in the inductor current using a", 
    "current source.", 
    "Oftentimes what happens is that if you turn on a current", 
    "source and try to pump a big current through an inductor,", 
    "and because the inductor appears as an open circuit to", 
    "that change in current, there can be huge voltage spike", 
    "across the inductor and cause the components to break down.", 
    "In the same manner with capacitors as well, if you", 
    "take a voltage source and you have a capacitor with a given", 
    "amount of--", 
    "so let's say I'm sitting with a capacitor with a given", 
    "voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "And then it's holding that voltage and I take a much", 
    "larger or a smaller voltage for that matter and I try to", 
    "connect that across the capacitor, the capacitor is", 
    "trying to hold its voltage.", 
    "But this new voltage comes in and that can cause a major", 
    "current spike through the system where the capacitor", 
    "looks like an instantaneous short when this change in", 
    "voltage is applied.", 
    "And there again, notice this duality between inductors and", 
    "capacitors where one deals with voltages and the", 
    "capacitor being a short, instantaneous short to changes", 
    "in voltages while a capacitor looks like an instantaneous", 
    "open to a external change in current."
