    "SPEAKER: So we built ourself an oscillator", 
    "using the op amp.", 
    "OK, this oscillator oscillates between minus VS and plus VS", 
    "at the output V0 as a function of time.", 
    "So the output of the op amp looks something like this, as", 
    "a function of time.", 
    "It goes from minus VS to plus VS. And OK, this is V0.", 
    "So as V0 sits there and oscillates by itself, it", 
    "produces this square wave that we can use for", 
    "a variety of purposes.", 
    "OK, one example use of this will be as a clock.", 
    "So what is a clock?", 
    "And why is it useful in digital systems?", 
    "OK, let's look at that next.", 
    "So interestingly, I just noticed the", 
    "page number down here.", 
    "So this is where you can get more information on clocks in", 
    "digital systems. But what is very curious is", 
    "this number, 555.", 
    "OK, this is a very curious number.", 
    "Completely coincidentally, this is the page in the book", 
    "in which you can read about clocks.", 
    "And completely coincidentally, this number has something very", 
    "interesting and historical to do with clocks.", 
    "OK, I encourage you go to the discussion forum and to figure", 
    "out what is it that 555 has to do with clocks, all right?", 
    "I'll let you worry about that.", 
    "OK, back to clocks in digital systems. So a clock is, think", 
    "of a clock as a square wave that's applied to digital", 
    "systems. And the clock can be useful for senders and", 
    "receivers to communicate effectively.", 
    "OK, as an example, suppose I have a sender and a receiver.", 
    "And the sender wants to send some values.", 
    "So let's say the sender really wants to send the sequence of", 
    "values, 1, 1, 0, as in the waveform shown here, OK?", 
    "Also notice that the waveform is a little funny, in the", 
    "sense that I have a 1 and 1.", 
    "I have a high part of the waveform out here with the 1", 
    "and 1 with the low part of the waveform showing 0, but then a", 
    "part of the waveform where the signal is a bit funky.", 
    "So for example, it could be that the output of the gate", 
    "that is producing the waveform, because of parasitic", 
    "capacitance and impedances, may have some ringing", 
    "associated with it.", 
    "OK, so something funky might be going on.", 
    "However, I want to communicate effectively.", 
    "So I would really like to see a transmission of 1, 1, 0.", 
    "How do I make it happen?", 
    "For example, the sender is sending 1, 1, 0.", 
    "But as a receiver, how on earth do I know whether the", 
    "signal that I just saw, is that a 1, 0?", 
    "Is it a 1, 1 0?", 
    "Or is it a 1, 1, 1, 1, 0?", 
    "I have no idea, because I just see a high followed by a low,", 
    "and I see some garbage in the middle, OK?", 
    "And because of the garbage, it's quite likely the receiver", 
    "is going to be thinking, huh?", 
    "What's that?", 
    "There's some funky stuff that's coming at me.", 
    "So the receiver can get really confused.", 
    "So here is one way of fixing the problem.", 
    "I can use a clock, OK?", 
    "Supposing I do the following.", 
    "OK, so the receiver is sitting there trying to figure out", 
    "when is the signal valid.", 
    "OK, remember the key word \"when\" is the", 
    "signal valid here?", 
    "Or is the signal valid here?", 
    "Or is the signal valid here?", 
    "The receiver doesn't know when to go and look", 
    "at the signal, OK?", 
    "So when you think of the word, \"when\", think clock, OK?", 
    "So here's an idea.", 
    "Suppose the sender and receiver share this green", 
    "signal called a clock.", 
    "So this green signal, called a clock, is shared by the sender", 
    "and receiver.", 
    "And that establishes a common time base for both the", 
    "receiver and the sender, OK?", 
    "So it establishes a common time base.", 
    "It tells the receiver when to look at the signal, OK?", 
    "So as an example, it could tell the receiver, hey,", 
    "receiver, look at the signal whenever the clock is high.", 
    "OK, so as an example, it can tell the receiver, look at the", 
    "signal here.", 
    "I have another value for you here.", 
    "I have another value for you here.", 
    "OK, it can say that, whenever the clock is high, look and", 
    "get a value at that point.", 
    "Similarly, from the sender's viewpoint, you can tell the", 
    "sender, sender, hey look, send a value to a receiver, but", 
    "make sure you send a value in such a way that the value is", 
    "valid throughout the clock being high.", 
    "If you take 6.004x and other such courses, you can learn", 
    "much more about these things.", 
    "And this course will be available in the future.", 
    "There are many, many ways of using a clock.", 
    "You can say the receiver can look at the signal when the", 
    "clock is high, for example.", 
    "That's the example I'm using here.", 
    "In other cases, with what is called edge-triggered logic,", 
    "you can tell the receiver, look at the signal during a", 
    "given clock edge, a rising edge or a falling edge.", 
    "But in our example, I'm simply going to say that the sender", 
    "needs to make sure that a valid signal is available to", 
    "the receiver whenever the clock is high.", 
    "So what does a receiver do?", 
    "So what a receiver does is that it transitions the output", 
    "in such a way that it knows the output is going to settle", 
    "down before the clock goes high.", 
    "So that, when the clock is high, the receiver can sample", 
    "it and the input is stable.", 
    "So notice here the receiver is looking at the output from the", 
    "sender whenever the clock is high.", 
    "Notice that the first time the clock is high,", 
    "it picks up a 1.", 
    "Then it picks up another 1.", 
    "Then it picks up a 0 out here, OK?", 
    "So it picks up a 0 at the point where the clock is high", 
    "for the third time because the receiver sees a 1, 1, 0.", 
    "And the receiver is pretty happy with that.", 
    "So what we have done here using the clock is another", 
    "kind of discretization which, unfortunately, we won't have a", 
    "lot of time to spend on in this course.", 
    "But it's another form of discretization.", 
    "It is discretizing time, rather than dealing with", 
    "continuous time, by using a clock, a broken", 
    "up time into quanta.", 
    "And in these discreet intervals of time, I can then", 
    "establish a common time base in which to transfer", 
    "information.", 
    "So as an example, I can transmit one bit of", 
    "information every clock cycle.", 
    "And in modern circuitry, I can often transmit many values in", 
    "a given clock cycle, but a clock fundamentally", 
    "establishes a common digital time base.", 
    "It's a common digital time base established between", 
    "various senders and receivers, various communication", 
    "entities, communicating entities within", 
    "the circuit, OK?", 
    "This is another simplification that makes systems a lot", 
    "easier to build, and it's called discretization of time.", 
    "Notice that discretization of time is one among another", 
    "major sequence of discretizations that we do in", 
    "systems to make it all work, OK?", 
    "Recall, in physics, we had the discrete mass or lumped mass", 
    "discipline where we lumped matter and got the point mass", 
    "simplification.", 
    "In the beginning of this course, we lumped matter and", 
    "came up with the Lumped Matter Discipline or LMD, OK?", 
    "And we came up with discrete resistors and inductors and", 
    "capacitors and so on.", 
    "So there, we discretized matter in order to get the", 
    "Lumped Matter Discipline.", 
    "Then, for the digital discipline, we discretized", 
    "value, and we got the digital abstraction.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So recall we discretized a lumped matter.", 
    "Then we discretized value.", 
    "And now we've talked about discretizing time, OK?", 
    "So this is a pretty cool sequence of things that we do", 
    "to make systems easy to design and build."
