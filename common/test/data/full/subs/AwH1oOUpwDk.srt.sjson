    "SPEAKER 1: Hopefully that little demonstration convinced", 
    "you that we are completely unprepared to study the", 
    "behavior of networks for sinusoidal inputs.", 
    "We notice that the output response, the amplitude of the", 
    "output decreased as the frequency increased.", 
    "And this is something that we haven't really understood.", 
    "We really haven't figured out the tools to analyze so far.", 
    "So what I'd like to do is I'd like to do a very simple", 
    "circuit example with a sinusoidal input.", 
    "The circuit I'm going to pick is a voltage source VI", 
    "connected to a series connection of a resistor and a", 
    "capacitance here, R and C. The voltage across the capacitor", 
    "is V, and the current through it is I. Now, this mimics the", 
    "input of the RC circuit that was part of the amplifier that", 
    "I showed you earlier.", 
    "So the amplifier looked like this.", 
    "So this was a MOSFET and a resistor.", 
    "This was my output, V0.", 
    "This was my gate capacitance, CGS.", 
    "GS, and this was my resistor, R. I said that was some", 
    "parasitic resistance of the wires and so on.", 
    "And then here I had my input voltage, so V bias and V small", 
    "signal input.", 
    "So I have some input VI.", 
    "And so this little circuit here is pretty accurately", 
    "modeled by the little RC network that", 
    "I'm showing you here.", 
    "I'm going to use a sinusoidal input.", 
    "So as a function of time, this is 0, this is VI of t.", 
    "And in this case, I'll pick something very", 
    "simple in this network.", 
    "I'll pick a straightforward sinusoid.", 
    "So mathematically, I could represent the sinusoid as VI", 
    "of t is equal to some amplitude VI cosine of omega", 
    "t, and for t greater than or equal to 0.", 
    "And I'm telling you that VI is real.", 
    "So VI might be a value, such as 2 volts or 3 volts or", 
    "something like that.", 
    "It's not an imaginary value.", 
    "It's a real value.", 
    "So it's VI cosine omega t.", 
    "Omega is the frequency and radiance", 
    "of the input sinusoid.", 
    "Let me also tell you that the input is 0 for t less than 0.", 
    "So an equivalent way of representing VI would've been", 
    "VI cosine omega t times u of t.", 
    "U of t was the input step.", 
    "Let me also give you the initial", 
    "condition on the capacitor.", 
    "And let's keep it simple.", 
    "Let's say that V of 0 is equal to 0.", 
    "And so for time t equal to 0, V is 0.", 
    "So let's say a 0 state response", 
    "for an input sinusoid.", 
    "OK, pretty straightforward, about as simple a circuit as", 
    "we can get, a little RC circuit", 
    "with an input VI sinusoid.", 
    "I'd And I'm going to measure the", 
    "voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "So before I dive into describing what this is, I", 
    "want to give you a little, little bit of a caution here.", 
    "I want to caution you about one thing.", 
    "I'll tell you what approach that I'm going to take.", 
    "So here on the left-hand side is my circuit.", 
    "And my goal is to determine V of t.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to plot my approach on", 
    "the right-hand side here.", 
    "So the x-axis is the time during this lecture sequence,", 
    "and the y-axis is effort.", 
    "How difficult it is going to be for us to go", 
    "and figure this out?", 
    "So what I'm going to do, so let's say down here is easy,", 
    "and let's say up here is agony,", 
    "incredibly, incredibly hard.", 
    "So what I'm plotting here is the approach I'm going to take", 
    "to solve this.", 
    "So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to", 
    "take a usual differential equation approach.", 
    "I'm going to take the usual", 
    "differential equation approach.", 
    "And for the first, oh, 20 or 30 minutes of this sequence,", 
    "I'll take the usual approach that we've learn about so far,", 
    "and it is going to be agonizing.", 
    "I'm sorry.", 
    "But I really want you to appreciate the beauty of some", 
    "of what I'm going to show you, and the way to appreciate that", 
    "is to look at something that is horrendously hard.", 
    "So I'm going to start down the path that we know so far, and", 
    "we will very quickly find that it is absolutely,", 
    "absolutely a disaster.", 
    "It's very, very hard.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is something that I", 
    "don't usually do.", 
    "I'm going to give up halfway.", 
    "I'm going to say, you know what, this is too hard.", 
    "I'm going to give up halfway.", 
    "And instead, I'm going to say let;s strike out in a", 
    "different direction.", 
    "Let's say that let's take a different approach, and I'm", 
    "going to call the approach a sneaky approach.", 
    "I'm going to sneak and do an end-run.", 
    "And I'm going to do an end-run around this problem and take a", 
    "sneaky approach.", 
    "And we're going to find that it is", 
    "going to be a lot easier.", 
    "This is going to be a lot easier than the differential", 
    "equation approach.", 
    "So that's what we're going to cover in this sequence today.", 
    "So then if you thought the sneaky approach was easy, in", 
    "the next sequence, I'm going to show you-- not in this one,", 
    "the next sequence.", 
    "I'm going to show you a super, super sneaky approach, just a", 
    "spectacular approach in the next sequence that will make", 
    "it almost a by-inspection, write-down-the-answer kind of", 
    "thing for sinusoids--", 
    "absolutely unbelievable.", 
    "And this will result in your next big aha! moment.", 
    "So not in this sequence, but in the next sequence, you will", 
    "see the big aha!", 
    "So I would like you to indulge me.", 
    "And let's start with the horrendous approach, the", 
    "differential equation approach.", 
    "But don't give up.", 
    "Don't run away.", 
    "Stay with me.", 
    "Don't worry if it's hard or if I lose you.", 
    "We're going to find an easy approach.", 
    "And then we're going to find a super easy approach.", 
    "So bear with me, and let's go down this path.", 
    "And let me show you the hard approach and", 
    "then the sneaky approach."
