    "SPEAKER 1: All right, let's start by go to our next step,", 
    "step two, find the homogeneous solution.", 
    "OK, I've shown you the homogeneous equation here with", 
    "the drive set to zero.", 
    "So we'll start with the first step of solving the", 
    "homogeneous equation, which is to assume a solution of the", 
    "form, Ae raised to st. So VH is equal to Ae raised to st.", 
    "You're going to assume this form", 
    "where A and s are unknowns.", 
    "So the reason, you may ask, why is it that we are assuming", 
    "the form Ae raised to st?", 
    "Well, we don't know.", 
    "We are guessing.", 
    "OK, we're guessing that might be correct or might be a", 
    "reasonable solution.", 
    "And first of all, in 6.002x, that's the one", 
    "we use all the time.", 
    "Both the first order and second order", 
    "equations, we use that form.", 
    "And the reason we pick that form is that, if you look at", 
    "the differential equation here, the nice thing about the", 
    "form Ae raised to st is that, as a differentiator, time and", 
    "time again, the e raised to st part of it is retained as you", 
    "differentiate further and further.", 
    "So for example, if I differentiate it once, I get", 
    "As e raised to st. OK, and if I differentiated d by dt", 
    "again, I get As squared e raised to st. So notice that e", 
    "raised to st part is present as I differentiate it time and", 
    "time again.", 
    "And this gives me hope, OK?", 
    "And the reason is that I have a VH here, and a first", 
    "derivative of VH, the second, and so on.", 
    "And since e of st is retained in each of these forms,", 
    "there's a good chance that this is", 
    "going to be a solution.", 
    "OK, so what I'd like you to do is we have built a little", 
    "exercise for you where I would like you to find out if Ae", 
    "raised to st is a suitable solution, OK?", 
    "And the way you will do that is you will take Ae raised to", 
    "st, and you will substitute that into the", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "OK, you will substitute Ae raised to st for VH into the", 
    "second order differential equation.", 
    "And then you will find an equation in s that must be", 
    "satisfied for a solution of the form Ae", 
    "raised to st to be workable.", 
    "OK, I would like you to go and find that polynomial.", 
    "OK, so let's write this down.", 
    "Find the polynomial in s that must be satisfied.", 
    "OK, so go ahead, substitute Ae raised to st in the equation,", 
    "the differential equation.", 
    "And find out what polynomial in s must be satisfied in", 
    "order for Ae raised to st to be a reasonable solution, OK?", 
    "So go ahead and try it out.", 
    "And then I will give you the answer."
