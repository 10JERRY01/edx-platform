    "SPEAKER: OK, so let me do this very quickly for you, just to", 
    "show you that this is, indeed, a whole lot easier than the", 
    "trig metric approach.", 
    "So, again, recall this was the trig approach.", 
    "And this was the sneaky path that I took.", 
    "So here's my solution.", 
    "So as a first step, I had to set up my", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "And I observed the circuit and set the", 
    "differential equation up.", 
    "And this is what I got.", 
    "RC dv dt plus v equals Vi--", 
    "where my input was--", 
    "Vi cosine of omega t.", 
    "So Vi was Vi cosine of omega t.", 
    "That was my first step.", 
    "So as my second step, I applied the sneaky input Vi e", 
    "raised to st. And by the way, I use the silly term sneaky", 
    "all the time, just to relate that to the s that I have in", 
    "my e raised to st, where s is the short form for j omega.", 
    "So s equals j omega.", 
    "Just keep that in mind.", 
    "And then find the particular solution.", 
    "Apply the sneaky input.", 
    "Then find particular solution to the sneaky input.", 
    "So the particular solution to this sneaky input is vp e", 
    "raised to st. And this is the trapezoidal vp that we keep", 
    "talking about, the complex amplitude.", 
    "So let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So the sneaky input that I apply, the", 
    "result in this equation.", 
    "And then I go ahead, and I need to find the particular", 
    "solution to the sneaky input.", 
    "So I go and find vp e raised to st.", 
    "And how do I go about doing that?", 
    "I substitute that in to the equation that I have. So it's", 
    "RC dv p e raised to st dt plus vp e raised to st. And that is", 
    "equal to Vi e raised to st.", 
    "Let me first go and differentiate it.", 
    "So I get RC times vp times s e raised to st plus vp s e", 
    "raised to st. And that is equal to Vi e raised to st.", 
    "Now I can cancel out the e raised to st's.", 
    "And I simplified that a little bit.", 
    "And I end up getting vp is equal to Vi 1 plus s RC.", 
    "And this is the famous complex", 
    "amplitude that is so important.", 
    "Recall that all the information about the", 
    "sinusoidal steady state is contained in this vp.", 
    "So finally, the final step, step number four, was to find", 
    "the steady state solution for v--", 
    "find vp, which is the steady state solution for v.", 
    "So find vp, the steady state solution to input Vi.", 
    "And that is simply given by vp, is given by amplitude vp", 
    "cosine omega t plus angle vp.", 
    "So notice that pretty much all that I want to know--", 
    "the magnitude of the final output and the", 
    "phase of the output--", 
    "are all given by this little component here. vp the complex", 
    "amplitude off the sneaky output.", 
    "So that was easy.", 
    "Single slide.", 
    "And if you think this was easy, in the next sequence, I", 
    "want to show you something that is spectacularly easy.", 
    "Believe it or not, but we will write down the vp in one", 
    "single step.", 
    "We will get rid of all of the stuff.", 
    "Not here, but in the next sequence I'm going to show you", 
    "how we can get rid of all of that stuff and simply write", 
    "down vp by inspection."
