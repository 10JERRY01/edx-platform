    "SPEAKER 1: OK, let us now\nget into the meat of", 
    "this lecture sequence.", 
    "Let us start by trying to\nunderstand how to build a", 
    "digital gate.", 
    "What I&#39;m going to do is try to\nbuild up your intuition using", 
    "an analogy.", 
    "So let us say I have the\nfollowing system.", 
    "I have a reservoir of water.", 
    "And what I&#39;m going to do is\nconnect it through a pipe to", 
    "some output, C. And what I&#39;m\ngoing to do in the pipe is", 
    "have to think of them\nas taps or faucets.", 
    "OK, so I have two\ncontrols here.", 
    "Think of them as taps that are\nin series with each other.", 
    "And let&#39;s take a look\nat what happens.", 
    "Let me call them A and B.", 
    "So how does this work?", 
    "So suppose, under what\nconditions, do you have H20,", 
    "or water, at the output?", 
    "Well, you get water\nat the output when", 
    "both A and B are open.", 
    "When I set both of them into a\nstate where they allow water", 
    "to pass through, then C\nwill contain water.", 
    "If either of them is shut off,\nthen there won&#39;t be any water", 
    "in C. So I can write this into\nsome kind of an equation in", 
    "the following way.", 
    "I could say, if A is on and\nB is on, then C has water.", 
    "But if both A and B are not on,\nthen what we&#39;re going to", 
    "see happening is that\nC has no water.", 
    "So if A is on and B is\non, then C has water.", 
    "But if either one of them\nis shut off, then C", 
    "will have no water.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to use this insight\nto build an AND gate.", 
    "Now, think of the water here\nas your power supply.", 
    "The water here, like the power\nsupply, is going to--", 
    "it&#39;s like a power supply.", 
    "It&#39;s going to supply juice.", 
    "And I want to have water flow\nhere to the output only if", 
    "both taps A and B are on.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to use this insight\nto build a AND gate.", 
    "Well, that&#39;s pretty good.", 
    "Let me give you another example\nand show you what I", 
    "might do to build a OR gate.", 
    "How might I get a OR function?", 
    "Well, let me start with a\nsimilar sort of reservoir", 
    "containing water.", 
    "And then, what I&#39;ll do in this\ncase is, rather than", 
    "connecting the switches in\nseries, I&#39;m going to have two", 
    "pipes that connect in parallel\nin the following manner.", 
    "So I have two branches, and I\nwant to set up a little tap in", 
    "each of them.", 
    "I&#39;m going to call them A and\nB. And my output here, as", 
    "usual, I&#39;m going to call C.", 
    "So in this case, what\ndo you see?", 
    "In this case, you see C\nhas water if either A", 
    "or B is turned on.", 
    "So this is a OR function.", 
    "So in this case, if I turn\neither of the taps or faucets", 
    "on, then my output has water.", 
    "So now switching over to the\nelectrical domain, let&#39;s", 
    "convert to a electrical\nanalogy.", 
    "So in this case, supposing I\nhave some voltage source", 
    "supplying the voltage [? V ?],\nand suppose in this situation,", 
    "I set up two switches.", 
    "Let&#39;s call them A and B. So this\nis a switch, and this is", 
    "a switch as well.", 
    "I have a couple of switches.", 
    "And what I&#39;m going to do is,\nsupposing I connect a bulb to", 
    "my switch and I complete\nthe circuit here.", 
    "So A and B are switches.", 
    "And let&#39;s say C is the bulb\nturning on or off.", 
    "So I have two switches,\nA and B.", 
    "So in this case, I can write my\nlittle equation as follows.", 
    "If A and B are turned on, then\nbulb C will turn on.", 
    "But otherwise, if both A\nand B are not on, then", 
    "bulb C will turn off.", 
    "So this is a drawing from the\nsame analogy with the little", 
    "water reservoir.", 
    "And so here, if I turn off\neither one of A or B, I won&#39;t", 
    "have my bulb turning on.", 
    "I&#39;m going to use this insight\nto build a AND gate.", 
    "So notice that, only when A and\nB are turned on, I&#39;m going", 
    "to have current that goes\nthrough the bulb.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to use that insight\nto build a gate.", 
    "But notice that the key here\nwith this logic was the", 
    "concept of a switch.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to start by\ninventing a switch device.", 
    "Let&#39;s create a switch device.", 
    "And then using this insight\nhere, we are going", 
    "to build a AND gate.", 
    "And then we&#39;ll build other\nforms of gates as well.",
