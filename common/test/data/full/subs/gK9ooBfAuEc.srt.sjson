    "SPEAKER 1: All right.", 
    "Now that we&#39;ve seen some\nnon-linear elements, let&#39;s", 
    "build some circuits containing\nthese non-linear elements, and", 
    "let&#39;s understand how to analyze\nthese circuits.", 
    "Interestingly enough, I will not\nreally be teaching you any", 
    "new methods beyond the first\nthree methods that let you", 
    "analyze non-linear circuits.", 
    "I&#39;m just going to use the same\nmethods and, in fact, use the", 
    "basic node method, and then\nshow you how to solve the", 
    "equations that arise using\nvarious techniques.", 
    "So really, it&#39;s a basic node\nmethod that will need to be", 
    "applied to solve\nthese circuits.", 
    "So let&#39;s start.", 
    "Let me build a little example\ncircuit for you using the", 
    "hypothetical ExpoDweeb\nthat we defined in", 
    "the previous lecture.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with\na little circuit.", 
    "So let&#39;s say my circuit contains\na volted source with", 
    "a voltage V and has some\nresistance R here.", 
    "And then I connect my little\nhypothetical device--", 
    "the ExpoDweeb--", 
    "out here.", 
    "And vD and iD--", 
    "iD&#39;s the current that flows\nthrough it, and vD&#39;s the", 
    "voltage across the device.", 
    "So this device here is\nnone other than my", 
    "hypothetical ExpoDweeb.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at how we\nmight analyze a circuit like", 
    "this, a circuit containing\nsome linear elements, and", 
    "there is this non-linear\nelement.", 
    "And it&#39;s non-linear because,\nas you can see,", 
    "iD relates to vD.", 
    "So before we begin, I want to\nshow you a little trick.", 
    "One of the things that you will\nsee a lot in 6.002x and", 
    "in circuits courses and in\nengineering practices in", 
    "general is that engineers like\nto deal with patterns.", 
    "Once we figure out a way of\ndoing something, then, even", 
    "though we may have a lot of\nchoices, we continue to keep", 
    "reusing that pattern.", 
    "And in circuits and electronics,\nwhenever we come", 
    "across a pattern, and we\nidentify that pattern for you", 
    "so that you can remember that\nand cast that in your mind as", 
    "something to bear in mind as\nyou build future circuits.", 
    "So these patterns are really,\nreally critical.", 
    "So notice here that I showed\nyou a pattern.", 
    "I had a voltage V here, a\nresistance R, and there&#39;s a", 
    "pattern in the circuit.", 
    "This pattern is some funky\nlittle device that is here.", 
    "In this case, it&#39;s a\nnon-linear device.", 
    "But in general, it could be any\nstrange device, whether", 
    "it&#39;s non-linear, whether it&#39;s\nsome other interesting device.", 
    "But let&#39;s say we identified\nthat as any funky element.", 
    "But if you look to the left of\nthat device here, I have my", 
    "usual stuff.", 
    "I have a voltage source in\nseries with a resistor.", 
    "So I claim this is a very\nimportant pattern.", 
    "The pattern is a voltage\nsource in", 
    "series with a resistor.", 
    "And then the series voltage\nsource and resistor are", 
    "connected to some interesting\ndevice in a series connection.", 
    "So I claim this is a very\nimportant circuit pattern.", 
    "So why do you think\nthis is a very", 
    "important circuit pattern?", 
    "So consider the following\nsituation.", 
    "Consider that I have\nmy device here.", 
    "No surprises there.", 
    "And let me mark out the vD\nand iD for this device.", 
    "OK, that&#39;s the same funky\nlittle device.", 
    "So the terminal pair, let&#39;s say\nmy branch variables, let&#39;s", 
    "say I identify a v and an\ni where i is like this.", 
    "Let&#39;s, just for kicks, identify\na v and an i, that", 
    "little pair of terminals\nthat I defined here.", 
    "So now, let&#39;s do something\nvery interesting.", 
    "Let us say that I have some big\ncircuit connected to that", 
    "interesting little device.", 
    "And that big circuit, some\ncircuit network N contains a", 
    "whole bunch of elements.", 
    "It could have a bunch\nof linear resistors.", 
    "It could have a bunch of\nlinear voltage sources.", 
    "And it could also have\na whole bunch of", 
    "linear current sources.", 
    "More resistors.", 
    "In some arbitrary connection,\nthis is an", 
    "arbitrary linear circuit.", 
    "So this circuit here on the\nleft-hand side is an arbitrary", 
    "linear circuit.", 
    "It could have all kinds of", 
    "connections of linear elements.", 
    "So now do you see where\nI&#39;m going with this?", 
    "Did you notice the\nkey trick here?", 
    "So the key here is that if I\nhave this arbitrary circuit", 
    "here, but if it&#39;s composed of\nlinear elements, and then what", 
    "I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve taken this\nfunny little device and yanked", 
    "it out of the rest of the\ncircuit and put it outside.", 
    "So it&#39;s as if I have\na bag of stuff.", 
    "And let&#39;s say that there&#39;s\nsomething interesting.", 
    "What I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve pulled\nthat interesting", 
    "thing out of the back.", 
    "But leaving the rest of the bag\nas linear stuff, but the", 
    "interesting thing has\nbeen pulled out.", 
    "But everything else is linear\ninside that bag.", 
    "So now, the trick here is that\nI can take this entire bag of", 
    "linear stuff and recall the\nfamous Thevenin Method.", 
    "I can replace this huge bag of\nlinear stuff with the Thevenin", 
    "equivalent given by\nthe V and R--", 
    "the voltage source in series\nwith the resistors.", 
    "So this huge network here, for\nthe purpose of analyzing i and", 
    "v, can be replaced\nby a Thevenin", 
    "equivalent that I show here.", 
    "So you see the magic of this?", 
    "If all I cared about was just\nthe voltage and current here,", 
    "then I can take the entire\nlinear network-- completely", 
    "arbitrary--", 
    "and I can rephrase that with its\nThevenin equivalent, shown", 
    "here, for the purposes\nof computing v and i.", 
    "So suddenly, I can take this\narbitrary circuit and replace", 
    "that with a Thevenin equivalent,\nand then simply", 
    "have the strange device\non the outside.", 
    "Notice that this strange\ndevice, which may be", 
    "nonlinear, cannot be contained\ninside the network, because", 
    "since it&#39;s non-linear, I cannot\nreplace it with the", 
    "Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "So I really have\nto pull it out.", 
    "And if what I&#39;m left with is a\nlinear network, then I can", 
    "replace it with a Thevenin\nequivalent.", 
    "Now, this is extraordinarily\npowerful.", 
    "Why is it extraordinarily\npowerful?", 
    "The reason is that if I showed\nyou how to analyze this", 
    "circuit pattern--", 
    "that is a simple circuit pattern\ncontaining a voltage", 
    "register connected in series\nwith the funky little device.", 
    "If I can understand how to\nanalyze the above simple", 
    "circuit pattern, then what it\nmeans is that I can analyze", 
    "any one of the more complex\ncircuit patterns below.", 
    "So once I understand how to\nanalyze v and R in series with", 
    "the funky little device, then\nwhat that means is that I can", 
    "now understand how to analyze\nany other circuit that is", 
    "linear connected to this\nfunky little device.", 
    "This is truly extraordinary.", 
    "So between [UNINTELLIGIBLE],\nwe really don&#39;t have to go", 
    "through 50 different circuits.", 
    "We can just analyze this\nCircuit 1, and once we", 
    "understand it, we are done.", 
    "Then we can always replace the\nrest of the circuit with the", 
    "Thevenin equivalent and then\ngo ahead and analyze our", 
    "device in the context of the\nrest of the circuit.", 
    "This is just extraordinarily\npowerful.",
