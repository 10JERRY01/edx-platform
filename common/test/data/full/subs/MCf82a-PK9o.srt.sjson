    "PIOTR MITROS: So we need a better model to represent the", 
    "temporal behavior of the op amp.", 
    "So a past model has been the following.", 
    "Here is an abstract operational amplifier symbol", 
    "with two inputs.", 
    "And our previous working model has been a V-plus and a", 
    "V-minus terminal with a dependent voltage source with", 
    "a gain A. Again, that dependent voltage source", 
    "amplified the difference between V-plus and V-minus by", 
    "an amplification factor A.", 
    "Now, what we saw happening in the previous video was that if", 
    "there was a small perturbation at the output of the op amp--", 
    "OK, let's say a small perturbation--", 
    "we saw that that perturbation was fed back to the input.", 
    "And somehow, that feedback to the input caused further", 
    "changes in the output of the op amp.", 
    "So there was some kind of a time behavior", 
    "to the whole thing.", 
    "The op amp had a time behavior in which various parts of the", 
    "circuit were reacting to temporal changes.", 
    "So what we need is something to capture time behavior.", 
    "And if we look at normal op amps, they have capacitances", 
    "and resistances as part of their circuits.", 
    "Every wire that connects one little component inside the op", 
    "amp to the next component has some capacitance and", 
    "resistance associated with it.", 
    "And as you know, these capacitors have to be charged", 
    "up to the resistances.", 
    "And so things take time.", 
    "Because the signal values have to charge up the capacitor to", 
    "the resistors, things take time.", 
    "So let's try to build that model into the op amp and see", 
    "how the dynamics of the op amp change as we use a more", 
    "sophisticated model.", 
    "That dynamic will allow us to more accurately model how the", 
    "op amp output is going to react to a noisy burst", 
    "somewhere in the circuit.", 
    "So here's how I'm going to change my circuit.", 
    "So this is my op amp.", 
    "So this is my op amp.", 
    "And what I'm going to do is build in a dynamic model", 
    "inside the amplifier, the op amp model.", 
    "So here's what I'm going to do.", 
    "So the model that I'd like you to use is a resistor, R, a", 
    "capacitor, C. And the voltage across the capacitor C I'm", 
    "going to call V-star.", 
    "It's an internal voltage.", 
    "And then V-plus, V-minus are going to behave like so.", 
    "OK, so I'm going to model the effect of V-plus and V-minus", 
    "down to the capacitor in the following way.", 
    "So I'm going to start with a dependent voltage source", 
    "that's going to have the difference voltage V-plus", 
    "minus V-minus.", 
    "So that's my dependent voltage source that reflects the", 
    "differential input, V-plus and V-minus.", 
    "And that dependent voltage source then is connected", 
    "across an RC.", 
    "The RC then, in turn, has the voltage", 
    "V-star across the capacitor.", 
    "And then my output is going to be A times V-star.", 
    "OK, so let's take a look at what happens in this model in", 
    "both an ideal situation and with the dynamic.", 
    "So in this particular model, supposing I did not have a", 
    "resistance, supposing my resistance R was 0, if R was", 
    "0, then V-plus minus V-minus directly", 
    "falls across the capacitor.", 
    "So V-star would be directly equal to V-plus minus V-minus.", 
    "And then A times V-star would simply be A times", 
    "V-plus minus V-minus.", 
    "It would be the ideal situation.", 
    "But if I have a finite resistance R, then a change in", 
    "V-plus minus V-minus will take some time to be", 
    "reflected in V-star.", 
    "Notice, if you recall from your RC circuit days, that if", 
    "I apply an input to an RC circuit, the voltage across", 
    "the capacitor in the CD circuit, V-star, will", 
    "eventually take on the value of the input.", 
    "So V-star will eventually become V-plus minus V-minus.", 
    "And that will reflect the difference", 
    "in the inputs exactly.", 
    "But it will take some time to get to that point.", 
    "So you can see how I've now reflected the time domain", 
    "behavior into my op amp circuit.", 
    "And using this, we can now try to model what happens if I get", 
    "a sudden small change in the output and see what happens."
