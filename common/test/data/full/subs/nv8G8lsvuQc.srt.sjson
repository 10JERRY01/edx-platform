    "SPEAKER 1: Up to this point, we've seen linear circuits.", 
    "And over the next days of the course, we will switch to", 
    "looking at nonlinear circuits.", 
    "So the place that we'll start is by looking at something", 
    "called the digital abstraction.", 
    "With linear circuits, you use the whole", 
    "spectrum of possible voltages.", 
    "So if your power [? rails ?] are at 0 to 3.3 volts, you use", 
    "all of those voltages.", 
    "With a digital abstraction, you divide those voltages into", 
    "ranges, for example, from 0 volts up to 1 volts, and from", 
    "maybe 2 volts up to 3.3 volts.", 
    "And you only keep voltages within these strangers and you", 
    "ban everything in the middle.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Ah, so basically we can assign a symbol to each of", 
    "those two ranges that the [? legal ?] range is.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Yes, so might, for example, call this first range", 
    "0 and the second range 1.", 
    "Now let's say we want to have a circuit that just takes an", 
    "input and buffers that input, keeps it the same as it was.", 
    "What we'd want to do is to make sure it", 
    "stays within this range.", 
    "So if we look at this as our input and we look at", 
    "an output over here.", 
    "Thank you, Jerry.", 
    "What we want to make sure is that things over here map", 
    "towards the middle of the range.", 
    "So we sort of draw a line like this.", 
    "Something here maps to here and something over here would", 
    "map to something over here.", 
    "And on the other hand, something over here might map", 
    "to something over here.", 
    "And something over here to something all the way up here.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: So what we're doing is we're making the 0's better", 
    "0's and the 1's better 1's.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And if we plot this, so we're now going to", 
    "switch this to be an axis over here.", 
    "I guess maybe an axis over this way might work best.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: I'll hold it for you.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: We see that this maps over here, this maps over", 
    "here, this maps over here.", 
    "That was mapping over here and this maps over here.", 
    "So as we plot this, we see that in the middle there has", 
    "to be a range here where the slope is greater than 1.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And the tops and bottoms have", 
    "to be sort of flat.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Yes, so they flatten out a", 
    "little bit over here.", 
    "Normally they flatten out a lot more.", 
    "It would sort of look more like this.", 
    "That's just the points that I happened to pick.", 
    "And to do this, we're introducing a", 
    "concept called gain.", 
    "Gain means that you have circuits where the output is", 
    "bigger than your input.", 
    "So if we swing the input a little bit inside of this", 
    "forbidden region- -", 
    "SPEAKER 2: It will a huge difference in the output.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: --the output will swing a lot.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: OK, well of course one way to think about that is", 
    "we could make things with sort of valves in them.", 
    "Like, for example, this.", 
    "I'll have to put a piece of paper down here.", 
    "And so, imagine that the power supply for some system is", 
    "basically filling up a big tank of water fairly high.", 
    "So it's under high pressure.", 
    "That's the voltage.", 
    "And then what happens is we have a little valve down here.", 
    "Here's a pressure meter that's measuring pressure.", 
    "And I'm allowing water to flow down like this.", 
    "So here there's no pressure at all basically.", 
    "Now I have a little valve that I could shove in and therefore", 
    "turn off the flow.", 
    "And the pressure on the meter goes up.", 
    "And if I pull the valve out, then the flow goes through and", 
    "the pressure on the meter goes down.", 
    "I can adjust that to be a valve that's proportional", 
    "perhaps, so that I can use this for an amplifier.", 
    "But if I shove it all the way hard in, then I'm", 
    "turning the flow off.", 
    "Or if I pull it all the way out and I'm turning the flow", 
    "on, that's basically the digital", 
    "type of use of a valve.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And I could use this to drive a second valve.", 
    "So I could take another instance of this, put it right", 
    "here, this drives another valve.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Right, Because the pressure, at this point, can", 
    "be taken out and used to push in and out", 
    "the valve over here.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So basically you're using a small single", 
    "controlling big signal and that's how you get", 
    "amplification.", 
    "And this fundamentally usually requires us having", 
    "some kind of switch.", 
    "So in the case of circuits, this is how we build a switch.", 
    "We put a resistor up, for example, for 3.3 volts.", 
    "We put a switch in the middle.", 
    "And we make a voltage control that switches.", 
    "And in the lectures we will see a particular type of", 
    "switch called a transistor which--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Does exactly that.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: --and it could either digital.", 
    "So first we'll see this work as a digital switch when we", 
    "try this at the very low or very high", 
    "and we see it switch.", 
    "And then we'll see how we use it to have actual gain.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: The gate here, and the gate is actually the", 
    "little plunger in the switch, think of it that way.", 
    "And it lets electrons through it or not.", 
    "Think of it that way.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So we'll first look at these things as a concept", 
    "of digital.", 
    "And then we'll look at them in the [? context ?] of analog", 
    "where we move this gate up and down and we get bigger singles", 
    "as if, for example, you were trying to drive music from", 
    "your mp3 player into a headphone where you needed a", 
    "little bit more signal, or worse, into a speaker."
