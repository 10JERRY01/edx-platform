    "SPEAKER 1: Now before I let\nyou get carried away with", 
    "voltage control current sources,\nI do want to point", 
    "out that there are many\nother types of", 
    "dependent sources as well.", 
    "So for instance, here\nis one example.", 
    "So this is the usual diagram of\na dependent current source", 
    "with a control port\nand a output port.", 
    "And each of the ports\nhas a terminal pair.", 
    "I have a control port with\nassociated variables vi and", 
    "ii, and the output port\nwith associated", 
    "variables v0 and i0.", 
    "So my good old voltage\ncontrolled current source that", 
    "you&#39;ve already seen as a\nreference looked like this,", 
    "where the current i for this\nvoltage controlled current", 
    "source was some function of the\ncontrol port voltage vi.", 
    "So this was a voltage controlled\ncurrent source.", 
    "We also call this a VCCS.", 
    "So another example of a\ndependent source, and again I", 
    "take the same template for\ndependent sources with the", 
    "same control port and\nsame output port.", 
    "Notice that it&#39;s the exact\nsame template as a VCCS.", 
    "And in this case it is also a\ndependent current source, so", 
    "this stays the same.", 
    "It&#39;s a dependent\ncurrent source.", 
    "And its i is going to be some\nfunction of some other", 
    "parameter in the circuit.", 
    "In the VCCS case, this\nwas a function of vi.", 
    "Now in this case, I&#39;m going\nto do something else.", 
    "I&#39;m going to make it a current\ncontrolled current source.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to measure the\ncurrent here, ii, and I want", 
    "to say that my output current is\nsome function of the input", 
    "current ii.", 
    "So in this case, this output\ncurrent is a function of the", 
    "input current ii.", 
    "So this is a current controlled\ncurrent source.", 
    "And this is also known as a\ncurrent controlled current", 
    "source or CCCS.", 
    "Now you can also have voltage\ncontrolled voltage sources and", 
    "current controlled\nvoltage sources.", 
    "So in those cases, you will\ndraw, instead of a dependent", 
    "current source, you will draw\na dependent voltage source.", 
    "And the diagram for that\nlooks as follows.", 
    "So this is a dependent\nvoltage source.", 
    "So this picture that I&#39;ve\nshown you here is for a", 
    "dependent voltage source.", 
    "And you can have this be\ndependent on a voltage, so in", 
    "that case it would be\ncalled a voltage", 
    "controlled voltage source.", 
    "Or you can have it dependent on\nthe current in which case", 
    "it would be current controlled\nvoltage source.", 
    "So there&#39;s four different\nkinds.", 
    "You have a voltage controlled\nvoltage source, VCVS, or a", 
    "current controlled voltage\nsource, CCVS. Or you can have", 
    "a voltage controlled current\nsource or a current controlled",
