    "SPEAKER 1: So here is a clearer", 
    "picture that is drawn--", 
    "a clearer PowerPoint picture\ndrawn so it&#39;s easier to", 
    "understand.", 
    "And let me just walk through\nthe various signals that I", 
    "have in this and see if\nthis really works.", 
    "So I have VI of t.", 
    "That&#39;s my music.", 
    "And that gets converted\nto iD of t.", 
    "And that&#39;s the current through\nthe Light Emitting ExpoDweeb.", 
    "And then, that gets converted\nto light.", 
    "That light goes and impinges on\nthe photoreceiver, and it", 
    "produces a current, iR of t.", 
    "And that then gets amplified,\nand I produce some sound", 
    "through some kind of\na speaker system.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at this\nlittle set of transfers that", 
    "are happening.", 
    "And what is interesting here\nis that based on my", 
    "assumptions, where I&#39;ve said\nthe intensity of light is", 
    "proportional to iD coming out,\nand the intensity of light", 
    "impinging on the photoreceiver,\nXR, will be", 
    "directly proportional to the\ncurrent that comes out of it.", 
    "So in that case, I have several\ncomponents here which", 
    "are linear.", 
    "So iD tuning into\nlight is linear.", 
    "I&#39;ve told you that light\nintensity is", 
    "proportional to iD.", 
    "And similarly, I&#39;ve told you\nthat the conversion from light", 
    "intensity on the photoreceiver\nto the current, I told you", 
    "that is linear.", 
    "And why don&#39;t I also tell you\nthat the current i gets turned", 
    "into sound and an actual\nlinear amplifier.", 
    "So my amplifier is a\nlinear amplifier.", 
    "And so that gets turned\ninto sound.", 
    "Oh, and by the way, we learn how\nto build amplifiers pretty", 
    "soon in this course.", 
    "So all this seems pretty good\nexcept for one thing.", 
    "Notice that this piece here, VI\ngetting converted iD, this", 
    "is nonlinear.", 
    "That is the problem.", 
    "So everything is linear, save\nfor this piece here, where my", 
    "conversion from VI to\niD is nonlinear.", 
    "And the reason is that for this\nExpoDweeb, the equation", 
    "that I have, is my good\nold equation iD, is", 
    "ae raised to bVD.", 
    "So given that equation,\nthe conversion", 
    "from VD to VI is nonlinear.", 
    "Notice that in this case,\nVI is the same as VD.", 
    "If the node voltage here is VI,\nit is equal to the node", 
    "voltage here, VD.", 
    "They&#39;re two of the same.", 
    "So given that, VI to iD\nconversion is non-linear", 
    "because my device\nis nonlinear.", 
    "And that is a problem.", 
    "And what that will do is that\nwill lead to distortion.", 
    "The problem is that this is\nnonlinear, and so this will", 
    "result in distorted sound.", 
    "So we can also look at that\npictorially, and look at that", 
    "graphically.", 
    "Let me show you how that\nmight look like.", 
    "Here is IV relationship\nfor the ExpoDweeb.", 
    "So this my usual relationship\niD equals ae raised to bVD.", 
    "Since I picked the ExpoDweeb,\nit&#39;s the same relationship", 
    "that you&#39;ve been looking\nat so far.", 
    "And VD equals to VI, because\nthe two nodes are the same.", 
    "So this was my transfer\nfunction.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at how the\ndistortion comes about if", 
    "I apply some input to VI.", 
    "Some kind of input.", 
    "So let&#39;s say, for instance, I\napply a sinusoidal input where", 
    "VD equals VI.", 
    "So I apply a sinusoidal\ninput here.", 
    "So this is my sinusoidal\ninput.", 
    "So that&#39;s VI.", 
    "So if I apply the sinusoidal\ninput, let&#39;s try to figure out", 
    "what the output looks like.", 
    "Let me show you a rather\nstylized way of computing", 
    "outputs given a transfer\nfunction.", 
    "This is a little bit of a\nconstruction that I find very,", 
    "very, very useful.", 
    "So what I do is I take this--", 
    "this is VD here.", 
    "So I take this curve, and I\ntranslate that and lay it on", 
    "its side like this.", 
    "So I get VD making traversals\nlike this.", 
    "And this is my time axis.", 
    "So this is my VD-axis.", 
    "So I make VD parallel to this\naxis, so I can now see what", 
    "happens when the voltage VD\nvaries and how it relates to", 
    "the transfer function curve\nbetween iD and VD.", 
    "Then what I do is to\nlook at the output.", 
    "Let me go ahead and place\niD out there.", 
    "And my claim is that iD is\ngoing to look like this.", 
    "Note that this iD is completely\ndifferent.", 
    "Looks completely different\nfrom VD.", 
    "And I&#39;ll show you in a second\nwhy that is so.", 
    "And that will result\nin distortion.", 
    "So given a VD curve like this\nand a transfer function given", 
    "by iD versus VD up here, let&#39;s\nsee how we can plot how the", 
    "output looks given various\nvalues of the input.", 
    "So let&#39;s start.", 
    "So supposing I have an input\nright here of iD.", 
    "So let&#39;s start a point here.", 
    "Let&#39;s see what the output will\nlook like for that point.", 
    "So I go up.", 
    "So I go way up here.", 
    "And for this value of VD, I\nnotice that the current is", 
    "going to be up there.", 
    "So for this value of VD, that\nis going to be the current.", 
    "And so, I can go ahead and\nplot the current at", 
    "that point out here.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So at time, t equal to 0, which\nis here, and t, time", 
    "equal to 0, which is here, my\ncurrent is going to be this.", 
    "So let me mark those points.", 
    "Let me mark them\nas a,b, c, d,e.", 
    "So that&#39;s a that corresponds to\nthis point on the transfer", 
    "curve, on the iD curve.", 
    "And let me mark that\nas a here as well.", 
    "Now let me pick me the second\npoint and see what happens.", 
    "And so, that second point\nwill result in--", 
    "that is the voltage here.", 
    "And that will result in a\ncurrent that is given by this", 
    "transfer curve out there.", 
    "And then, I can move it\nover to the iD side.", 
    "So notice that for this value\nof time, I get this point in", 
    "the transfer curve, and\nI get an x here.", 
    "So that&#39;s my point b.", 
    "OK, so my point b, b, and\nb are all the same.", 
    "So for input at point b, I get\nmy current given by that.", 
    "OK, I can take another\npoint, point c.", 
    "And they can line up.", 
    "And so, it corresponds\nto this VD.", 
    "And that corresponds\nthis value of iD.", 
    "And so, that corresponds\nto this point in time.", 
    "So notice that this point in\ntime, which is about this", 
    "point in time.", 
    "And this is my point c.", 
    "So a, b, c on this curve will\ntranslate to a, b, c on the", 
    "current curve out there.", 
    "So notice that when I got\nsomething like this, in this", 
    "case, I get something that\nlooks like this.", 
    "And notice, of course, for\nvalues that are negative, for", 
    "these values, I get this\npart of the curve.", 
    "And the reason is that\nif you look at--", 
    "let&#39;s say, for example, I pick a\npoint here and I take a line", 
    "up here, then this is the\ncurrent, which is a slightly", 
    "positive value.", 
    "The time point is here.", 
    "And so the time point is here.", 
    "So this current will relate\nto this value here.", 
    "So if I call that a, b, c, d,\nthen this is d, and then this", 
    "would be my point, d.", 
    "So notice that a lot of\ndistortion happening here,", 
    "because my device cannot\ngo down negative.", 
    "It can only have positive\nvalues.", 
    "So as you can see, I&#39;m getting\na distorted output iD that", 
    "doesn&#39;t look anything\nlike the input", 
    "curve, the input sinusoid.",
