    "SPEAKER: The small signal method is extremely important.", 
    "So much as we analyze the small signal method from a", 
    "graphical point of view, and then a mathematical point of", 
    "view, followed by a circuit method, let's do the same", 
    "thing again for our amplified and dependent sources.", 
    "And look at a small signal behavior graphically, then", 
    "mathematically.", 
    "And then in the next sequence, we will look at it from a", 
    "circuit viewpoint.", 
    "So let's start with the graphical way", 
    "of looking at this.", 
    "Recall as before, we've applied our DC offset here.", 
    "So this is my DC offset or bias.", 
    "And this is the small signal of interest. And my total", 
    "signal DI I is out here.", 
    "So graphically, go back to my VI versus Vo curve and note", 
    "that bias my amplifier at this point Vi Vo by", 
    "applying a DC offset VI.", 
    "So this is my operating point.", 
    "And then, let me go ahead and mark the operating points here", 
    "on the curve.", 
    "And this gives me--", 
    "this is my VI and this corresponds to Vo.", 
    "So then, as I said before, I am going to exercise my signal", 
    "about a small portion about that curve.", 
    "And this little thing here was my delta VI and a", 
    "corresponding output was going to be here.", 
    "This is delta Vo.", 
    "And if I had a small signal that looked like this, let's", 
    "say for instance my small signal was a little sinusoid", 
    "that looked like this.", 
    "Then my output would be inverted, and would also be a", 
    "more or less linear sinusoid that looked like that.", 
    "It would be amplified as shown in this figure.", 
    "Note also that these are the boundary points of my", 
    "saturation region for the amplifier.", 
    "So as long as I bias my amplifier at VI Vo such that", 
    "it was in a saturation region, and used a small signal for", 
    "VI, let me call that delta VI here for now, I would get a", 
    "more or less [UNINTELLIGIBLE] response.", 
    "I want to revisit the small signal model notation that we", 
    "had discussed in a previous sequence.", 
    "And recall again that the small signal model is also", 
    "called the incremental model, or the linearized model.", 
    "So our input notation looked like this.", 
    "My total variable VI was given as the sum of the DC offset", 
    "plus a small signal vi.", 
    "and so far in this sequence, I have been calling it delta VI", 
    "just to make it very clear that it was a small signal", 
    "incremental response.", 
    "So we call this our total variable.", 
    "And VI was our DC bias.", 
    "And small v small i was our small signal input.", 
    "And then, don't forget that the DC bias was also called", 
    "the operating point input voltage.", 
    "Now we had a corresponding notation for the output.", 
    "So for the output, the total visibility v0 was simply the", 
    "sum of a DC offset capital V capital O and a", 
    "small signal vo.", 
    "No surprises here, this is pretty much", 
    "what we'd seen earlier.", 
    "And in the past, we've also called this delta vo just to", 
    "make it clear that this is a small", 
    "signal incremental change.", 
    "We can draw out example inputs and outputs.", 
    "So again, recall my input is given by capital V capital I", 
    "plus small v small i for the total input.", 
    "And the output is also corresponding the sun of the", 
    "DC offset plus the small signal input voltage.", 
    "So let me plot as an example for you vi and V0.", 
    "So let's say my bias voltage capital V capital I is here.", 
    "So this is VI.", 
    "And then, let's say I use some small signal here.", 
    "Let's say it's input that looks like this.", 
    "And this piece here is my small signal input vi.", 
    "My output, my corresponding output will look like this.", 
    "So let's say my output will be at some offset V0.", 
    "And I can write that like so.", 
    "And then my output will have some amplified excursion,", 
    "small v small o.", 
    "Notice I get an inversion.", 
    "And so the output might look something like this.", 
    "It wasn't very good there, was it?", 
    "OK, some amplified version of the input.", 
    "This doesn't look very good at all, but I guess you can think", 
    "about what it looks like.", 
    "It should be exactly this curve, but", 
    "stretched out and amplify."
