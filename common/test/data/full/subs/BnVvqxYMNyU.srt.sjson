    "SPEAKER: All right, thus far, we examined two examples.", 
    "In the first example, we just took a voltage source across a", 
    "resistor and computed the static power.", 
    "And we showed that directly related to the static power in", 
    "an invert when it had a one or a zero applied at the input.", 
    "We did a second example.", 
    "In the second example, we took a capacitor and we used a pair", 
    "of switches to charge and discharge the capacitor.", 
    "But notice that when switch one was turned on, switch two", 
    "was turned off.", 
    "Switch two was turned on, switch one was turned off.", 
    "Now as I told you earlier, that is not quite the", 
    "situation in our inverter.", 
    "And I'll show you why that is the case.", 
    "It's a little more complicated.", 
    "So back to our inverter.", 
    "Our goal was really to find out P for the inverter.", 
    "And recall again, this capacitor C is the capacitor", 
    "of the gate capacitance of the gates being driven by this", 
    "inverter and also any parasitic capacitance of the", 
    "wires and things like that.", 
    "So to compute the power in this particular situation, I", 
    "would like to pick some input.", 
    "So let me pick a symmetric zero one sequence that is", 
    "going to drive this gate.", 
    "And similar to what we did in the past for example two, let", 
    "me pick a square wave and apply it to", 
    "the input of my inverter.", 
    "So V on the y-axis and this is time.", 
    "Let us say that it's a symmetric waveform here.", 
    "So T by 2 high and T by two low.", 
    "And let's say this is my period and this", 
    "then further repeats.", 
    "And assume that the interval is the", 
    "reciprocal of the frequency.", 
    "So this is frequency.", 
    "So let me figure out the average", 
    "power for this situation.", 
    "Now, so we've drawn all the stuff for you rather cleanly", 
    "here so that my input is shown below and my frequency is f.", 
    "So let's start by drawing the equivalent circuit for my", 
    "little inverter here.", 
    "All right, let's see what it looks like.", 
    "So for my inverter, what do I see here?", 
    "So I see a voltage source Vs. The Vs is connected to Rl and", 
    "to the capacitor going to ground at all times.", 
    "And no matter what happens to this MOSFET, the voltage", 
    "source is connected to a resistor and then to the", 
    "capacitor at all times.", 
    "So I would just redraw the circuit in the following way", 
    "just to make it compatible to example two.", 
    "So this is Vs. So one terminal of Vs goes to ground.", 
    "That's ground.", 
    "The other terminal of Vs goes to resistor Rl.", 
    "So I'm going to draw that like this.", 
    "I'm just going to change the topology here.", 
    "So that's Rl.", 
    "And then if you look at one of the terminals of Rl, that goes", 
    "through the capacitor and then to ground.", 
    "So this is my v not.", 
    "So that goes through the capacitor and then to ground.", 
    "Capacitor C. Because I've just drawn Vs on the capacitor in", 
    "the following in that manner.", 
    "Then the node with voltage v not, that goes through the", 
    "MOSFET, through the ohm resistance of", 
    "the MOSFET to ground.", 
    "So v not, I have a MOSFET connected to ground.", 
    "And what I'll do is I'll model the MOSFET with its SR model.", 
    "So with the SR model and so I have a switch and then I have", 
    "an R on and that goes to ground.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "So this equivalent circuit is the equivalent circuit for the", 
    "inverter shown on the right hand side.", 
    "So this is the switch which is the MOSFET.", 
    "It's my MOSFET switch.", 
    "So you should stare at the two circuits and convince yourself", 
    "that the circuit I've drawn here, the equivalent circuit", 
    "I've drawn here correctly deflects the inverter shown on", 
    "the right hand side.", 
    "So what I would like to do is compute what is the average", 
    "power for this input and use this equivalent circuit to", 
    "compute the average power.", 
    "Just stare at the circuit for a couple of seconds.", 
    "If you go ahead and stare at the circuit here, the circuit", 
    "is almost the same as a circuit we did earlier.", 
    "Just that in the earlier circuit, I had a", 
    "little switch here.", 
    "So that switch is nonexistent.", 
    "So this means that my voltage source Vs is always connected", 
    "to the capacitor through Rl.", 
    "I don't have a switch that is turning that connection off", 
    "when the second switch turns on.", 
    "So this circuit is a little bit more complicated.", 
    "Just to make sure everybody understands this is a little", 
    "bit more complicated, let me just write that down.", 
    "All right, so what I'd like to do next is let's go ahead and", 
    "present the results for the energy dissipated by this", 
    "equivalent circuit which reflects more accurately the", 
    "inverter shown on the top right hand side.", 
    "So what is P?", 
    "What is the power for the gate for that circuit?", 
    "Let me write down that equivalent circuit here so you", 
    "have it as a reference.", 
    "So this is Vs, the resistance, Rl.", 
    "It goes to capacitance, C and then that, in turn goes", 
    "through a switch to the resistance, R on.", 
    "My goal is to find out what is the energy or rather the", 
    "average power for the circuit when I drive the MOSFET", 
    "inverter using a symmetric square wave as an input.", 
    "So it actually turns out that the derivation of the power", 
    "consumed by the circuit, first by computing the energy and", 
    "then dividing by the cycle time t is a little bit more", 
    "complicated and grubby than the circuit we did earlier in", 
    "example two.", 
    "So I won't do the analysis here but just point you to", 
    "section 11.3 of the textbook where the derivation is", 
    "completely shown.", 
    "So I am just going to write down the result here.", 
    "So we can show from section 11.3 of A and L. So you can go", 
    "look at that for the full derivation.", 
    "So we can show that the average power for the circuit", 
    "is given by this expression.", 
    "So here we have two terms, Vs squared divided by 2 r on plus", 
    "r on plus CVd squared vf, CVs squared f.", 
    "Rl squared divided by R on plus R on all squared.", 
    "And to see the derivation, go and look at", 
    "section 11.3 in the book.", 
    "It gets a bit messy so I don't show that here.", 
    "Now let me simplify this a little bit.", 
    "Notice that for typical values of Rl and R on, for example,", 
    "Rl might be 10 kiloohms, 10k, and R on might be few tens of", 
    "ohms. And so Rl might be 100 times larger than R on.", 
    "So I'm going to neglect R on in comparison to Rl.", 
    "So an Rl is much greater than R on.", 
    "I can ignore R on.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "I get a very simple expression for P. So my P becomes equal", 
    "to-- so if I ignore this R on, I get Vs squared by 2 Rl.", 
    "And for the right hand side, if I ignore this R", 
    "on, what do I get?", 
    "If you ignore that R on, then I can cancel out Rl squared", 
    "and Rl squared.", 
    "So that leaves me with CVs squared f.", 
    "Well, you've seen that before.", 
    "The first term here is from the thing I", 
    "marked with a star earlier.", 
    "And the second term here is from the thing I marked with a", 
    "double star.", 
    "We can do the exact same thing to do right for", 
    "the previous circuit.", 
    "And when I assume that Rl is much greater than R on.", 
    "So the term on the left hand side, the single star, this is", 
    "my static power, OK?", 
    "The standby power.", 
    "The term on the right hand side is my dynamic power or", 
    "active power.", 
    "So you recall how we got that.", 
    "So static power is simply the power being burned in R2", 
    "because of a connection from Vs through R2 to ground.", 
    "And then the second term, the dynamic power is because I'm", 
    "switching the capacitor and putting charge in the", 
    "capacitor and discharging it.", 
    "And that relates to how frequently I do that.", 
    "And because it relates to how frequently I do that, they", 
    "call it do a charge when the square root is high and then I", 
    "do a discharge--", 
    "I'm sorry, I do a charge of the capacitor in this", 
    "particular situation when the input is low and then do a", 
    "discharge of the capacitor when the input is high.", 
    "So, in this situation, I get a dynamic power that relates to", 
    "the frequency.", 
    "If you look at this inverter here, the MOSFET, and here's", 
    "my capacitor, notice that if my frequency is higher, then", 
    "I'm going to charge and discharge the capacitor on", 
    "each of these cycles.", 
    "We just have a higher frequency then we're charging", 
    "and discharging at a higher frequency.", 
    "And so my dynamic power will increase in proportion to f,", 
    "the frequency.", 
    "So let's discuss some of these terms. The static power is", 
    "independent of the frequency and the half term comes--", 
    "how did the half term show up?", 
    "Well, the half term showed up because, notice here in the", 
    "top right hand corner, when the switch here is off, when", 
    "the switch is open, I don't have a path from Vs to ground.", 
    "I don't have a path from Vs to ground so there's no static", 
    "power being consumed.", 
    "But when the switch is on for half the time, there is static", 
    "power being consumed.", 
    "So the half shows up because the static power is consumed", 
    "only for half the cycle.", 
    "The MOSFET is on only for half the time.", 
    "The dynamic power relates to switching the capacitor.", 
    "Notice interestingly, that both the static and dynamic", 
    "powers relate to the square of the voltage.", 
    "Square of the voltage here, square of the voltage here.", 
    "What that is saying is that the voltage that I apply has a", 
    "profound impact on the power being burned.", 
    "It's Vs squared.", 
    "The amount of capacitance matters and the frequency", 
    "matters for the dynamic power.", 
    "But notice that Vs has a profound impact on the power.", 
    "So we will look at some numbers in a few minutes and", 
    "try to get more insight into what this all means."
