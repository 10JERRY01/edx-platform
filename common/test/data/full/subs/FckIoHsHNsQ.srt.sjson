    "SPEAKER 1: And to demonstrate that, I have a little", 
    "demonstration here that has an inverter, and we'll up the", 
    "frequency of the square wave driving the inverter.", 
    "I'm going to show you a few numbers, so hang on for two", 
    "minutes after this demo.", 
    "I'll give you some numbers, and I want you to go ahead and", 
    "compute the numbers based on what we've seen here.", 
    "And you will get suitably impressed, I promise you.", 
    "So this is the input fed to the inverter.", 
    "This is the output of the inverter.", 
    "Notice that the output of the inverter reflects some sums of", 
    "an RC time constant because of the", 
    "output driving the capacitor.", 
    "And the same way here.", 
    "So I start off by showing you that, on the left hand side, I", 
    "show you I'm simply measuring the power being consumed by", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "And notice that the power being consumed is expressed by", 
    "the needle being at this point here.", 
    "So this is just a very low frequency.", 
    "So this is almost all standby power, OK?", 
    "Consumed by the inverter, all right?", 
    "So the inverter's on half the time, and when it's on it's", 
    "consuming power.", 
    "So what I'm going to do now is increase the frequency.", 
    "As I increase the frequency driving the inverter, what", 
    "should happen to this needle?", 
    "So as I increase the frequency there, that waveform should", 
    "become closer and closer together.", 
    "And what should happen to the needle?", 
    "That should begin to go up.", 
    "So as I increase the frequency, it should consume", 
    "more and more power, and the needle should start going up.", 
    "So let me do that for you.", 
    "So in terms of numbers there, it's on top of the four on the", 
    "scale in the middle.", 
    "So I'm going to increase the frequency very slowly.", 
    "Unfortunately, the sampling scope messes up the waveform.", 
    "So ignore the waveform for now.", 
    "Just look at the meter as I increase the frequency.", 
    "OK, notice that I've increased the frequency by about a", 
    "factor of two or three.", 
    "And notice here that the needle has moved to the right.", 
    "And I can keep doing that and the needle keeps", 
    "moving to the right.", 
    "As I'm consuming more and more power, I'm driving the", 
    "inverter faster, and faster, and faster.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So that should convince you that there is a standby power.", 
    "And that some power component is related to frequency.", 
    "This relates to your standby power in your cellphone.", 
    "This relates to active use."
