    "SPEAKER: We just saw that as long as we operate our", 
    "amplifier in the saturation region, we got", 
    "amplification all right.", 
    "But the problem was it was highly nonlinear.", 
    "So how do we go about getting a linear", 
    "response out of our amplifier?", 
    "Well, let's go back to our small signal trick.", 
    "If you recall, with the small signal method, I had you focus", 
    "on a small segment, a small line segment of", 
    "our transfer curve.", 
    "So this is the VI VO transfer curve.", 
    "I need you to focus on the segment.", 
    "And focus really hard and recall what I said earlier, do", 
    "the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] thing.", 
    "And if you observe it, what do you see?", 
    "So let's draw a little cartoon here.", 
    "OK, so go ahead and focus on this little", 
    "piece of line segment.", 
    "What does it look like?", 
    "Well, as we can see, it looks like a little straight line.", 
    "So not surprisingly, let me focus on a small piece of our", 
    "nonlinear curve.", 
    "It looks more or less linear.", 
    "So if I mark this point as VI, VO.", 
    "VI, VO here.", 
    "This is my point.", 
    "The line segment about that point looks", 
    "more or less linear.", 
    "You're going to use this insight and build upon our", 
    "small signal trick to get a linear response", 
    "[UNINTELLIGIBLE] amplifier.", 
    "So let's just write down this little note here.", 
    "So given that the little line segment looks more of less", 
    "linear, here is what we could do.", 
    "So let me mark that line segment again, this little", 
    "line segment.", 
    "And you recall that was about the point VI, V0.", 
    "So let me write that down as VI.", 
    "And let me write this point as V0.", 
    "This in my VI axis and this is my VO axis.", 
    "So remember the good old trick.", 
    "Remember the good old trick of boosting and", 
    "shrinking the signal.", 
    "So if I go ahead and apply a DC offset, so that my signal", 
    "is boosted to VI.", 
    "And then, if about that point I go ahead and apply a very,", 
    "very small signal input.", 
    "So recall that this is my point VI.", 
    "And then, let me go ahead and mark a small signal range", 
    "around that.", 
    "Let me call that delta VI.", 
    "And the corresponding output signal about that point is", 
    "delta VO, capital V capital O is the operating point and", 
    "delta VO are the small excursions of the output about", 
    "that point.", 
    "This little point here is VI comma VO.", 
    "So by applying a DC offset and, let's say my DC offset", 
    "here is VI.", 
    "And so by doing so and applying a small signal delta", 
    "VI about that point, I get very small excursions.", 
    "And those small excursions articulate a small region of", 
    "my output curve.", 
    "And in a sense, what happens is that the DC offset VI, VO", 
    "moved the region of action as if the axis is translated here", 
    "to delta VI delta VO.", 
    "And that small signal response there looks", 
    "more or less linear.", 
    "So here's my trick.", 
    "Let me go ahead and write down the steps for you.", 
    "So the first step, I want to operate my amplifier at a DC", 
    "bias, VI, VO.", 
    "And I can pick any point.", 
    "I can pick some point here, some point here.", 
    "And generally, a good choice is the midpoint of the", 
    "operating range.", 
    "But again, you can pick what you want.", 
    "So this is my VT.", 
    "And let's say this is roughly the point where VO", 
    "equals VI minus VT.", 
    "That was the end of the saturation region.", 
    "So as long as I pick something in this range, I am all set.", 
    "My amplifier will be in the saturation region.", 
    "And if I boost the input by capital V capital I, I get my", 
    "DC bias point there.", 
    "And then I shrink my input voltage, really shrink it to", 
    "be a small signal and that gives me a linear response.", 
    "So just summarizing that, so I superimpose a small signal on", 
    "top of VI and the small single was called delta VI.", 
    "And then, the response to the small signal is", 
    "approximately linear.", 
    "So this is just a repeat of the small signal trick that we", 
    "discussed earlier.", 
    "Just to refresh your memory, how do we go ahead and get", 
    "this kind of DC bias?", 
    "Well, from a circuit sense, here's what we're going to do.", 
    "And you've seen this before as well, but let this serve as a", 
    "good review.", 
    "So here is my VS. Let me draw the circuit.", 
    "Here's my MOSFET.", 
    "Here's the output V0.", 
    "And here is RL.", 
    "And so here is my input.", 
    "So how do I go about getting a DC bias?", 
    "Well, it's pretty simple.", 
    "I apply a DC voltage here VI, and that is by DC bias.", 
    "So this guy here offset voltage.", 
    "And this is also called a DC bias.", 
    "And then, my interesting signal is applied up here.", 
    "And for now I am going to call it delta VI.", 
    "So this is my interesting input signal.", 
    "So this DC bias VI boosts the signal to", 
    "the interesting range.", 
    "And it boosts it well above VT into the saturation region.", 
    "And then I have my small signal VI around that point,", 
    "and that gives me the essential response that I am", 
    "looking for."
