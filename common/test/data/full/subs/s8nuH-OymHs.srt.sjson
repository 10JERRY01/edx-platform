    "SPEAKER: So notice that here that's the same curve, the", 
    "transfer function.", 
    "And the MOSFET, the amplifier output is at VS until input", 
    "reaches a threshold voltage VT.", 
    "And once the input goes beyond VT, the output begins to drop", 
    "precipitously.", 
    "And at some point here, at some point this begins to go", 
    "into its triode region.", 
    "And what I'm going to do is simply increase the input", 
    "voltage VI, and you will see that the output then begins to", 
    "go into its triode region.", 
    "It keeps dropping.", 
    "And as you can see, the output begins to go into a space", 
    "where the gain is no longer more than 1.", 
    "And this is a triode region of MOSFET operation", 
    "OK, so the MOSFET's in saturation.", 
    "Things are going great.", 
    "As I increase my VI, notice at some point I begin to go out", 
    "of my saturation region in the MOSFET.", 
    "And somewhere here, I go from the saturation region and", 
    "transition into the triode region.", 
    "And this value shown here gives you the corresponding", 
    "input voltage and the output voltage."
