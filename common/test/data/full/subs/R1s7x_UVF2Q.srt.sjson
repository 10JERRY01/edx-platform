    "SPEAKER: Now let's look at how to compute the fall time.", 
    "OK, it's pretty much the same manner as we", 
    "did the rise time.", 
    "And so I won't spend too much time on it, but", 
    "do this very quickly.", 
    "For the fall time, notice that I have moved the", 
    "y-axis here, OK?", 
    "And I'm, as usual, going to compute VC,", 
    "the capacitor voltage.", 
    "And I'm starting off at time T equal to zero.", 
    "So for the falling waveform, VC is given by the final value", 
    "plus other stuff.", 
    "So the final value is the value the capacitor would", 
    "reach eventually.", 
    "And that is minus VS.", 
    "OK, if time T equals infinity, what is the final value the", 
    "capacitor would reach for the falling waveform?", 
    "Plus, I have to add to that the final value,", 
    "which is a low value.", 
    "This is for a falling exponential.", 
    "To that I add the change, and that, e to the", 
    "minus t over RC, OK?", 
    "So the final value here, I know that is minus VS. I know", 
    "the change is it's this difference.", 
    "OK, this is my change.", 
    "Start here, and I'm going to end up here, OK?", 
    "So this is going to be VS divided by 2.", 
    "OK, it starts off at VS divided by 2.", 
    "And I subtract out the final value that I reach.", 
    "So that's minus, minus VS, and so that is", 
    "equal to, again, 3VS/2.", 
    "So my equation for VC will be VC equals minus VS plus 3VS/2", 
    "times e raised to minus t over RC.", 
    "But I want tf.", 
    "And so, in order to get tf, this is tf.", 
    "This is tf, OK?", 
    "So tf is the time it takes VC to go from initial value of VS", 
    "divided by 2 to the final value of minus VS/2.", 
    "OK, not the eventual value, but it is going to stop at", 
    "minus VS/2.", 
    "So I write down minus VS/2 here.", 
    "And the rest of the equation, minus VS plus", 
    "3VS divided by 2.", 
    "And that, e raised to minus, that's a falling time over RC.", 
    "OK, so I can solve that in order to get tf, OK?", 
    "So I can solve that equation in order to get tf.", 
    "So we'll give you a little exercise to go and try out", 
    "finding out the oscillator frequency by yourselves."
