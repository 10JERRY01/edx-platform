    "SPEAKER 1: We could build a number of interesting circuits", 
    "with the op amp without negative feedback.", 
    "Again, recall when the op amp doesn't have negative", 
    "feedback, it is going to move with any slight perturbation.", 
    "It is going to try to hit the positive rail, Vs, or it's", 
    "going to hit the negative rail, Vs.", 
    "So in this particular instance, in the op amp portal", 
    "I want to show you Vs plus and minus Vs explicitly so you", 
    "know that Vs and V minus Vs are the positive", 
    "and negative supply.", 
    "So the op amp is going to hit those values, depending on", 
    "what the input is.", 
    "So the first circuit I'm going to build is a comparator.", 
    "What is a comparator?", 
    "A comparator is a circuit where, when I apply an input,", 
    "the output is going to shoot to either a plus, a Vs, or a V", 
    "minus, depending on whether the input", 
    "is positive or negative.", 
    "In this case, what I'll do is I'll", 
    "connect V minus to ground.", 
    "So V minus is set at zero volts.", 
    "I want to apply an input to V plus.", 
    "So my input, Vi, is applied to V plus.", 
    "So Vi is my input, and that is applied to V plus.", 
    "So now, what's going to happen is that when Vi is greater", 
    "than zero volts, the output is going to shoot positive.", 
    "But if Vi--", 
    "this is a Vi--", 
    "is greater than zero, it's going to shoot positive.", 
    "And if Vi is less than zero, the output is going to shoot", 
    "to a negative, minus Vs.", 
    "So this is a comparator.", 
    "What it does is that the output is a high if the input", 
    "is positive, and the output is a low if", 
    "the input is negative.", 
    "So I can build a transfer function of the", 
    "comparator as follows.", 
    "So I can say, V plus minus V minus is here.", 
    "And in this particular instance, since V minus is set", 
    "at ground, I can simply make this V plus.", 
    "So in this case, if the output is-- if V plus--", 
    "and in this case, it is also Vi, so I just stick", 
    "that in there too.", 
    "So if Vi is negative, my output is going to be negative", 
    "at minus Vs. But if my output is positive, then I'm going to", 
    "shoot up to plus Vs. And the transition happens here.", 
    "So this is my transfer function for the comparator.", 
    "So I can also do a time behavior of this.", 
    "So let's say I have some input, and let's say my input", 
    "looks like this.", 
    "Let's say that is my Vi.", 
    "So if I have an input that looks like that, what will my", 
    "output look like?", 
    "So for that input, my output.", 
    "So let's say Vs is here, and let us say", 
    "minus Vs is down here.", 
    "So if I apply this little red curve as my input, then my", 
    "output is going to look like this.", 
    "It is going to be high as long as Vi is high.", 
    "And will transition down here when Vi goes negative.", 
    "It's going to stay down there, minus VS, until the input goes", 
    "back up above zero.", 
    "And then I go at Vs once Vi goes above zero again.", 
    "OK, that's pretty good.", 
    "That's a comparator.", 
    "And this has a lot of uses.", 
    "I can use that to tell me whether input", 
    "is positive or negative.", 
    "And I can also use this to take the analog signal and", 
    "turn that into a one bit digital value, a zero, one", 
    "kind of sequence at the output, for a positive and", 
    "negative going analog signal as an input.", 
    "Now, one of the issues with a comparator like this is that", 
    "it has the unfortunate property that small", 
    "perturbations, or small noise imposed at the input, can", 
    "cause weird, unexpected behavior, behavior that I", 
    "don't quite like.", 
    "So let's say my input doesn't quite look like I showed you.", 
    "Let's say my input instead looks like this.", 
    "Let's say my input looks like this.", 
    "There's some noise imposed on the input.", 
    "Something like this.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And so notice here, if I focus on this part down here-- so", 
    "this is Vi.", 
    "If I focus down here, notice that right at this instant, it", 
    "doesn't have a clean crossing.", 
    "OK, let me amplify that little circle.", 
    "So this is the axis.", 
    "So let's say at that point, my input is not clean crossing,", 
    "but it's noisy.", 
    "And it looks something like that.", 
    "There's noise superimposed on it.", 
    "And because of that, notice that I don't make one clean", 
    "crossing of zero.", 
    "This is zero here.", 
    "But, since there's noise, I am going to meander back and", 
    "forth a little bit before I really cross it.", 
    "So in a situation like this, what really happens?", 
    "So with this, what will happen-- so this is Vs up", 
    "here, and I have a V minus s up here.", 
    "And what's going to happen is, so far, so good.", 
    "I'm going to have a clean Vs. But what's going to happen", 
    "down here is, as I make my crossing into the negative", 
    "territory, Vs is going to go down.", 
    "But then, because of noise, my input crossed back up.", 
    "I'm going to have a bounce back up to Vs in my output.", 
    "And then, because it crossed back down, and bounced back", 
    "up, and then, finally, I'm going to go like this.", 
    "So the part where the signal is crossing the zero line.", 
    "So this is my output here.", 
    "My output is going to go bouncing back and forth,", 
    "bouncing back and forth, bouncing back and forth,", 
    "because of all those crossings.", 
    "And this is not nice.", 
    "This is a problem.", 
    "I'm going to get a whole bunch of spikes as the noise in the", 
    "signal causes many more zero crossings than I know you want", 
    "to monitor.", 
    "So we look at another circuit.", 
    "But I'm going to use positive feedback, not run the op amp", 
    "in the open loop mode like this, but use positive", 
    "feedback to build what we call hysteresis into the circuit.", 
    "By building hysteresis into the circuit, I'm going to make", 
    "the op amp remember, I'm going to make the circuit remember", 
    "what happened in the past, so that it doesn't behave so", 
    "flippantly as did the open loop op amp.", 
    "OK, let's go ahead and check that out."
