    "SPEAKER 1: Next, let's check out this slightly more", 
    "involved circuit containing a capacitor,", 
    "inductor, and a resistor.", 
    "In this case, my input real amplitude is Vi.", 
    "My input is Vi cosine omega t.", 
    "So in this circuit is simply write down the complex", 
    "amplitude, or rather the amplitude Vi.", 
    "And that we measure the voltage", 
    "Vr across the resistor.", 
    "So my inductor, capacitor, resistor are in series.", 
    "And in this case I want to measure the", 
    "voltage across the resistor.", 
    "And I want to see what Vr divided by Vi looks like.", 
    "So before I do the math, by this point, you should be able", 
    "to knock this off completely intuitively in seconds.", 
    "So let's try to do that first as function of omega.", 
    "I would like to see what the magnitude of Vr divided by Vi", 
    "looks like.", 
    "And let's take a look.", 
    "As usual, go with the usual trick.", 
    "Let's look at low frequencies and that's then look at high", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "So what happens at low frequencies?", 
    "So let's say at low values of omega, what happens?", 
    "Let's see here.", 
    "So in this circuit, for low values of omega, the inductor", 
    "looks more or less like a short circuit.", 
    "However, for a very low frequencies, the capacitor", 
    "looks like a high impedance.", 
    "So most of the voltage drops across the capacitor or", 
    "another way to put it is that the capacitor blocks the low", 
    "frequencies at Vr.", 
    "So the capacitor blocks the low frequencies and so I get a", 
    "low response at Vr.", 
    "So at Vr I get a very low voltage because the capacitor", 
    "having very high impedance, most of the voltage drops", 
    "across the capacitor.", 
    "And recall that KVL applies for these impedance models.", 
    "By KVL it means that the sum of the across the loop, in", 
    "this case minus Vi, plus VL, plus VC, plus VR, must all be", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "Which means that if I get a large to drop across VC, then", 
    "the drop across VR must be pretty small.", 
    "So therefore, for low", 
    "frequency I get a low response.", 
    "OK, what about high omega?", 
    "What happens at high omega?", 
    "So the large of values omega, in this care, the capacitor", 
    "looks like a short circuit, but the inductor looks like an", 
    "open circuit.", 
    "So the roles are reversed in this case between the", 
    "capacitor and inductor.", 
    "But as far as the poor little resistor is concerned, it", 
    "doesn't matter.", 
    "In this case, the inductor seems to have blocked the high", 
    "frequencies and for high frequencies my output is,", 
    "again, going to be very low.", 
    "So for high frequencies, L blocks the high frequencies.", 
    "And as we said earlier, the capacitor blocks the low", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "And in the middle, notice that as the frequency increases", 
    "from very low frequency, then the impedance of the", 
    "capacitance decreases and more and more of the voltage drops", 
    "across R. And so we get some kind of a behavior", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "And we'll see that at that some value, which we'll figure", 
    "out in a second, the output is going to be unity.", 
    "At some value of omega, you're going to see that the voltage", 
    "the Vr is going to be exactly equal to Vi.", 
    "We will look at what that frequency is.", 
    "So now, let's go ahead and do the math here.", 
    "And so let's write down Vr divided by Vi according to", 
    "impedance model is the voltage divider action.", 
    "OK, so it's simply the impedance of R divided by the", 
    "sum of the impedances.", 
    "This is a straightforward voltage divider.", 
    "The sum of the impedances is a j omega L for the inductor", 
    "plus 1 by j omega C, plus R for the resistor.", 
    "OK, I can simplify this a little bit by multiplying both", 
    "the numerator and the denominator by j omega C. If I", 
    "do that multiplication, I get j omega CR divided by.", 
    "So j omega C multiplied by 1 by j omega C yields 1.", 
    "And then, I multiply j omega C and minus j omega C. So j and", 
    "j give me minus 1.", 
    "[UNINTELLIGIBLE]", 
    "I write down a minus here.", 
    "And then for the rest of it, I get omega squared LC.", 
    "So omega squared LC.", 
    "And then I get R times j omega C, which is j omega CR.", 
    "OK, I can write down the magnitude of Vr divided by Vi.", 
    "And the way I can take the magnitude is again pretty", 
    "straightforward.", 
    "So for the denominator I simply write the square root", 
    "of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.", 
    "So the real part is 1 minus omega squared LC.", 
    "I take the square that plus the square of the imaginary", 
    "part, which as omega squared RC squared.", 
    "And", 
    "Then I get the square and the square root of the numerator.", 
    "So this one gets me omega RC.", 
    "I just reversed R and C just make it roll of the tongue a", 
    "little bit more easily.", 
    "OK, so now let's take a look at this equation and see what", 
    "happens at this point here.", 
    "So what happened at the point where we get that little peak?", 
    "So in particular, let's investigate", 
    "what happens at resonance.", 
    "So at resonance, at which omega equals omega0.", 
    "And recall from earlier days, omega0 was 1 by", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "So what happens at omega equals omega0?", 
    "So look at this here.", 
    "If omega equals omega0, then omega squared becomes 1 by LC.", 
    "So omega squared is the square root of this value,", 
    "which is 1 by LC.", 
    "And LC divided by 1 by LC is 1.", 
    "And so this expression becomes 1 minus 1.", 
    "And that ends up giving me just omega squared RC the", 
    "whole squared.", 
    "Square root of omega squared RC the whole squared is simply", 
    "omega squared RC.", 
    "Oh, wait a second here.", 
    "How did I get that omega squared?", 
    "If you had a live class going on, you would", 
    "have caught me there.", 
    "So this square should not have been there.", 
    "That's better.", 
    "OK, I'm glad I caught that.", 
    "So notice that this has gone to 0 because omega squared is", 
    "equal to LC.", 
    "And then I get omega RC the whole squared.", 
    "And when I take the square root of that, I get omega RC.", 
    "So at resonance, I get Vr divided by Vi is simply 1.", 
    "OK, so now we've just shown that this point is omega0.", 
    "The omega0 is a special point and at that point I get the", 
    "output being exactly equal to the input and the", 
    "magnitude is 1.", 
    "And why did that happen?", 
    "The reason that happens is notice these two parts here.", 
    "If you do the math, if you substitute omega equals", 
    "omega0, you will notice that these two parts, j omega L and", 
    "1 by j omega C will cancel each other out.", 
    "In other words, ZL plus ZC equals 0 at", 
    "omega equals omega0.", 
    "So this is ZL and this is ZC.", 
    "And ZC will be minus 1 times ZL and those two will cancel", 
    "out that omega equals omega0.", 
    "So the beauty of this is that at that point if the two", 
    "impedances ZL plus ZC cancel each other out resulting in a", 
    "net zero impedance, in other words, here I see a net zero", 
    "impedance, that looks like a short circuit.", 
    "That is amazing.", 
    "At omega0 this looks like a short.", 
    "So what that means is that all of Vi simply appears across", 
    "the resistor.", 
    "So Vi just drops across R. Isn't that amazing.?", 
    "So this is very nice.", 
    "And we were able to look at these second order circuits,", 
    "look at low frequencies, high frequencies, and then what", 
    "happened at omega equals omega0.", 
    "We will stare at this kind of behavior of a capacitor and", 
    "inductor in a bit more detail shortly.", 
    "But for second order circuits, the three points that are good", 
    "to check are low frequencies, high frequencies, and omega", 
    "equals omega0.", 
    "That will pretty much let you sketch", 
    "these graphs from intuition."
