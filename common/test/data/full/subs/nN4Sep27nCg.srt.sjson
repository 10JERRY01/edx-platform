    "SPEAKER: We are almost there.", 
    "And by now we have lead you through a whole bunch of", 
    "grubby math, and you must be pretty much tired of it.", 
    "However, just hang in there for a couple more minutes, and", 
    "I'm going to show you some really, really cool tricks.", 
    "First of all, you will get the form you're looking for.", 
    "And second, I will show you a couple of techniques, whereby", 
    "you can do all of the stuff very, very quickly just by", 
    "inspection.", 
    "But it's really good to know how you can do all of this", 
    "stuff in a formal way so you understand the", 
    "theory behind it.", 
    "So now we have this expression.", 
    "After having done a bunch of math for the underdamped case", 
    "with alpha less than omega 0, we have Vt being a sum of a", 
    "sine and a cosine.", 
    "OK, remember that the scaled sum of sines of the same", 
    "frequency are also sines.", 
    "You can go and look this up in Appendix B.7, Section 7 in", 
    "Appendix B of the textbook.", 
    "So drawing this equation from the textbook, if I have a", 
    "scaled sum of sines, A1 cosine theta plus A2 sine theta.", 
    "Now you've probably seen this in high school.", 
    "We can express this as a single cosine using the", 
    "following formula.", 
    "So A1 cosine theta plus A2 sine theta is given by A1", 
    "squared plus A2 square root times cosine of theta minus", 
    "tan inverse of A2 divided by A1.", 
    "So I can convert scaled sums of sines of the same frequency", 
    "to a single cosine or a sinusoid.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "If I take this expression here, and notice it is a", 
    "scaled sum of sines and cosines.", 
    "So I get something multiplying cosine omega dt and something", 
    "else multiplying sine omega dt.", 
    "So here, theta is omega dt, A1 is V1, e raised to minus alpha", 
    "t and A2 is VI alpha divided by omega d e raised", 
    "to minus alpha t.", 
    "So I can write down v of t based on the scaled sum of", 
    "sines formula as VI minus.", 
    "I'm pulling VI out of there.", 
    "And I can pull out e raised to minus alpha t outside.", 
    "And then I go ahead and do the square roots for", 
    "alpha and omega d.", 
    "And here is what I get.", 
    "You can verify for ourselves that this is true.", 
    "Omega 0 by omega d, and then here I get a cosine of omega", 
    "dt minus tan inverse of alpha by omega d.", 
    "So if you take the expression in the top right-hand corner", 
    "and apply this scaled sum of sines formula,", 
    "this is what you get.", 
    "v of t equals VI minus--", 
    "notice this decaying exponential times the cosine.", 
    "This is what we were looking for all this time.", 
    "So there we have it.", 
    "Remember, we were looking for something cosine times a", 
    "decaying exponential, and this gives us our damped ringing or", 
    "damped sinusoidal model.", 
    "I could plot this for you.", 
    "Let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So it's my time 0.", 
    "Let's plot v of t.", 
    "And so my input as a function of time.", 
    "This is VI, is capital V capital I.", 
    "That's my input step.", 
    "So for my step input, let's see.", 
    "What does this look like?", 
    "So at time t equal to 0, I get 0.", 
    "Because when I punch in the value t equals 0", 
    "here, what do I get?", 
    "I will get 0 out here, so it becomes cosine of minus tan", 
    "inverse alpha of omega d.", 
    "e raised to minus alpha t goes to 1.", 
    "It's a little bit messy, but I encourage you to go and do the", 
    "math yourselves and convince yourselves that at time t", 
    "equal to 0, this whole thing becomes 1.", 
    "And so VI minus VI gets rise to 0.", 
    "I also know that Vt at time t equal to 0 has", 
    "been given to be 0.", 
    "And so the right-hand side will, indeed, go to 0.", 
    "You can go and convince yourselves.", 
    "In fact, you may want to hit the pause button here.", 
    "And before I go on and check for yourselves that at time t", 
    "equal to 0, the right-hand side with some appropriate", 
    "trigonometric manipulations will go to 0.", 
    "Let's see, what happens next?", 
    "When t is very, very large.", 
    "When t goes to infinity, then e raised to minus", 
    "alpha t goes to 0.", 
    "And so the second term goes to 0, which means v of t becomes", 
    "equal to VI.", 
    "So let's write them down.", 
    "So this is VI.", 
    "So I start off at 0 and for a long period of time, my output", 
    "is going to go to 0.", 
    "And then between there and the initial place, you recall for", 
    "the second order circuit I had something", 
    "that looked like this.", 
    "For the second order circuit, I had the sinusoid that looked", 
    "like this, where this was 2 VI.", 
    "Let me mark that.", 
    "So this was for the LC case.", 
    "In our case, what's going to happen is that because of the", 
    "resistance, I'm going to get damping.", 
    "And I'm going to end up here.", 
    "In the LC case, I just kept oscillating forever.", 
    "But in our case with the resistor, I come to a final", 
    "value given by VI.", 
    "So between those two points, you can plot out the", 
    "expression that you have here.", 
    "And this is what you will get.", 
    "Get something that looks like this.", 
    "You will see a damped sinusoid.", 
    "So this will be what you get when you add R to the circuit.", 
    "If you add R to your RLC circuit, that is what you get.", 
    "Notice also, another interesting thing.", 
    "Notice this damping here.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "And notice the decay there.", 
    "That decay goes as e raised to minus alpha t.", 
    "So that causes the sinusoid to get an envelope that gives you", 
    "this decaying sinusoid.", 
    "The other interesting features are much like you had a", 
    "frequency of oscillation with the LC circuit, you can figure", 
    "out the frequency of oscillation here as well.", 
    "And in this particular situation, if you take one", 
    "cycle of this.", 
    "So in the previous case, one cycle went from here to here.", 
    "And in our case, if you take one cycle, the cycle starts", 
    "here and will go all the way to here.", 
    "So this will be a cycle.", 
    "And in this case, the frequency is 2 pi by omega d.", 
    "It's not omega 0, it's omega d.", 
    "It's omega d here.", 
    "It's a damped natural frequency.", 
    "So the oscillations are at a frequency omega d, which is", 
    "slightly lower than omega 0.", 
    "Omega 0 was the frequency for the undamped case.", 
    "So here, the time.", 
    "So if omega d is the frequency,", 
    "then this is one cycle.", 
    "So the cycle time is 2 pi divided by omega d.", 
    "So here we've seen now that we've been able to get the", 
    "kind of behavior we are looking for.", 
    "And this ends the underdamped case.", 
    "And again, hold onto your horses.", 
    "I still haven't come to the point where things suddenly", 
    "become very easy, where I'll show you how you can get all", 
    "of these kind of results completely intuitively without", 
    "having to go through any of these differential equations.", 
    "But that before that, a couple of more points that I have to", 
    "go through."
