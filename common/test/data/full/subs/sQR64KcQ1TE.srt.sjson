    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "I hope you got a chance to try out the solution.", 
    "And let me go ahead and solve that for you.", 
    "My goal here will be to find the particular solution to the", 
    "sneaky input Vi e raised to st, and the particular", 
    "solution is Vp e raised to st. In particular, I did not know", 
    "what Vp is.", 
    "I need to find out Vp.", 
    "So let me go ahead and try that out.", 
    "Let me substitute this into that equation up there.", 
    "Let's see, what do I get?", 
    "So I get RC, and I need to differentiate Vp e raised to", 
    "st. And what I get is--", 
    "I'll just write that whole thing down.", 
    "Then I can do it again.", 
    "d Vp e raised to st, dt, plus Vp e raised to st, and that is", 
    "equal to Vi e raised to st. OK?", 
    "So now, let me go ahead and carry out the differentiation.", 
    "And so I get RC.", 
    "And I have Vp here.", 
    "And so I differentiate e raised to st, I get s e raised", 
    "to st. Plus Vp e raised to st equals Vi e raised to st.", 
    "So notice the beautiful property of exponentials.", 
    "Let me take a moment and extol the property of", 
    "exponentials here.", 
    "Notice that, very nicely, I got exponentials of all the", 
    "same form here.", 
    "So e raised to st, when differentiated, resolves in e", 
    "raised to st again.", 
    "So what I can do now is I can get rid of this from this", 
    "equation, and what I am left with is simply this.", 
    "Though I can cancel out Vp as well.", 
    "Oops, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.", 
    "I can't do that.", 
    "That wasn't good.", 
    "Let me see if I can erase that.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "Ah, that worked nice.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So I need to make that Vp here.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "Let me collect the terms that multiply Vp.", 
    "So I start off with RCs plus 1, and that is equal to Vi.", 
    "So that was pretty easy.", 
    "I found Vp quite easily.", 
    "So Vp is equal to Vi divided by 1 plus sRC.", 
    "Now that was easy.", 
    "Compare that to the trig mess that I have to go through for", 
    "the other input.", 
    "Recall that the Vi cosine omega--", 
    "or rather it was A that I picked.", 
    "So A cosine omega t plus phi was a mess as a solution to A", 
    "cosine omega t.", 
    "So instead, what I did was I picked an input Vi e raised to", 
    "st. I'm trying out a whole different path here.", 
    "You'll see in a moment, or in a few minutes,", 
    "why this will work.", 
    "And notice that, for this input, Vi e raised to st, I", 
    "found in a few easy steps the particular solution.", 
    "The particular solution is Vp e raised used to st where Vp", 
    "is given by this quantity, where Vi, 1, and", 
    "sRC all are all known.", 
    "s is known because this s is a part of my input.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So that was really, really easy.", 
    "But how does it help us?", 
    "So let's stare at this for a few seconds.", 
    "I've written Vp equals Vi divided by 1", 
    "plus sRC out there.", 
    "And notice that we are still trying to discover the sneaky", 
    "approach to solving our problem.", 
    "So if Vp is Vi divide by 1 plus sRC, then the particular", 
    "input, the particular solution to my sneaky input was Vps,", 
    "and that is equal to Vp e raised to st. Where Vp, I now", 
    "know, is given by 1 plus sRC e raised to st. OK?", 
    "I know that.", 
    "I just computed that.", 
    "So this is particular solution to input Vi e raised to st,", 
    "which I call my sneaky input.", 
    "So this is easy.", 
    "So now, if I replace s with j omega--", 
    "so suppose s is j omega--", 
    "so similarly, Vi divide by 1 plus j omega RC times e raised", 
    "to j omega t will be particular solution for the", 
    "input Vi e raised to j omega t.", 
    "All I've done here is replaced s equals j omega.", 
    "So instead of input Vi e raised to st, I have Vi e", 
    "raised to j omega t.", 
    "And instead of solution Vi divide by 1 plus sRC, I have", 
    "solution vI divide by 1 plus j omega RC times e", 
    "raised to j omega t.", 
    "So I've just done the replacement, s", 
    "equals j omega, here.", 
    "| notice that if we look at this piece here, this is the", 
    "complex amplitude of this complex number.", 
    "So this is a complex amplitude.", 
    "Recall when you express complex numbers in the form", 
    "sum, let's say, R e raised to j theta, R is the amplitude,", 
    "and in this case, e raised to j omega t is here, so this is", 
    "my Vi divide by 1 plus j omega, RC", 
    "is my complex amplitude.", 
    "So as you know, this is VP.", 
    "I'm going to write this down in a nice little symbols here,", 
    "because I'm going to be using that a lot.", 
    "Have a little trapezoid here, and mark this under trapezoid,", 
    "because we will be referring to this very, very frequently.", 
    "As a very quickly recap, what do we have here?", 
    "We said that we'll apply a sneaky input Vi e raised to", 
    "st, and we found that the solution to that input was", 
    "really, really easy to come by, and it was simply Vi", 
    "divide by 1 plus sRC times e raised to st.", 
    "And then we said if s was j omega, then correspondingly,", 
    "the output would be Vi divide by 1 plus j omega RC times e", 
    "raised to j omega t.", 
    "That was my particular solution to the sneaky input.", 
    "Where this complex amplitude here, this is a complex number", 
    "because of the j here.", 
    "So Vi divide by 1 plus j omega RC is a complex amplitude, and", 
    "I'm going to call that Vp.", 
    "We will see that a lot more shortly.", 
    "Just to be clear, I still haven't shown you why the", 
    "sneaky approach really works.", 
    "I'm still plowing down the sneaky path and seeing if I", 
    "will see the light.", 
    "But what I have seen so far is that finding the particular", 
    "solution to the exponential input was really, really easy.", 
    "What I haven't done yet is show you the connection", 
    "between this solution here and whatever I really want, which", 
    "is the solution to Vi cosine omega t.", 
    "So that is still a question mark.", 
    "I haven't shown you the connection between these two", 
    "because Vi cosine omega t is what i really cared about, but", 
    "I don't quite know what the answer to that is.", 
    "And in hopefully in the next few minutes, I will show you", 
    "the key connection."
