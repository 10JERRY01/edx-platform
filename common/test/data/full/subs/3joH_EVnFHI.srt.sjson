    "SPEAKER: OK, so I'm hoping you got it, but let me show you", 
    "the same thing again.", 
    "As I mentioned earlier, this is the same as VGS and this is", 
    "also the same as VDS.", 
    "And so there are two constraints", 
    "that we have to follow.", 
    "As I said, there's two constraints.", 
    "The first constraint is for the MOSFET, VGS must be", 
    "greater than or equal to VT.", 
    "This is to make sure the MOSFET is not in its cutoff.", 
    "In terms of VI, that constraint is the same as VI", 
    "greater than or equal to VT.", 
    "So VGS is the same as VI.", 
    "So again, as I said before, this is VDS and we mark that", 
    "explicitly, so there's absolutely no confusion.", 
    "So in this little circuit of ours, let's take a look at how", 
    "we have to operate the MOSFET.", 
    "So the second constraint is that I need to make sure that", 
    "the MOSFET is on the right-hand side here.", 
    "And on the right-hand side here, this", 
    "constraint must apply.", 
    "VDS must be greater than or equal to VGS minus VT.", 
    "So as an example, if I apply VI to be, let's say 3 volts.", 
    "And let's say under some condition-- so let's say VT,", 
    "for example, is 1 volt.", 
    "And in that case, the minimum value of VDS for saturation", 
    "operation will be 2 volts.", 
    "So 2 volts is the minimum value that VDS can get to.", 
    "So any value above 2 volts will give me", 
    "saturation region operation.", 
    "And generally what you need to watch out for, what are the", 
    "parameters of this amplifier that control what the output", 
    "voltage looks like?", 
    "Well, clearly if I make my resistance RL larger, then", 
    "more of the voltage will drop across RL.", 
    "And so V0 becomes smaller.", 
    "Alternatively, if I make my VS higher, if I increase VS, then", 
    "my V0 will also increase.", 
    "And so there's many ways in which I can do this.", 
    "I can increase the value of--", 
    "another thing I could do is I could think about picking a", 
    "MOSFET in a way.", 
    "Let's say, for example, I was to change my VGS.", 
    "Clearly as I increase my VGS or decrease my VGS, that will", 
    "also affect things.", 
    "Because after all, VGS is part of this equation.", 
    "And in fact, there's a very interesting relationship which", 
    "we'll look at in more detail shortly.", 
    "But notice that as VGS increases, the current", 
    "increases out here because of the square R relationship.", 
    "And when the current increases, this value of V0", 
    "will tend to go down.", 
    "So as VGS increases, VDS tends to go down.", 
    "And so it tend to push it again, into it's", 
    "non-saturation region.", 
    "Also, as I said before, because VDS is the same as V0,", 
    "I can also write this as V0 is greater than or equal to in", 
    "terms of VI minus VT.", 
    "So those are the two constraints.", 
    "Which means that if I operate the MOSFET under these two", 
    "constraints--", 
    "VGS greater than or equal to VT and VDS greater than or", 
    "equal to VGS minus VT--", 
    "at all times, if I do it at all times and I don't ignore", 
    "this discipline, then I'm going to get saturation region", 
    "of my amplifier at all times.", 
    "So next, what I'd like to do is I'd like to analyze this", 
    "MOSFET amplifier using the dependent current source model", 
    "and see what happens.", 
    "On the right-hand side here, you see the amplifier.", 
    "I've shown you that for reference.", 
    "And just remember, again, that VGS is equal to", 
    "VI and V0 is VDS.", 
    "So oftentimes we play fast and lose with sometimes calling it", 
    "VDS, sometimes calling it V0 in this connection.", 
    "There might be other connections of the MOSFET", 
    "where if for some reason we take V0 somewhere else, then", 
    "this is not going to be true.", 
    "But at this connection in this circuit that way we've labeled", 
    "it, V0 equals VDS and VGS equals VI.", 
    "How do we analyze a circuit like this?", 
    "This is a MOSFET device and the way we analyze it is we", 
    "are told that it's in saturation region operation.", 
    "We've adhered to the saturation discipline.", 
    "And so the first thing I can do is simply the MOSFET with", 
    "its dependent current source model.", 
    "So let me draw out the MOSFET.", 
    "Here's my resistance RL.", 
    "So this is V0.", 
    "And here is my MOSFET.", 
    "My MOSFET originally here was my drain.", 
    "This is my source connected to ground.", 
    "And this was my gate terminal here.", 
    "And let's say I connected it to some input VI.", 
    "Again, this was equal to VGS.", 
    "And this was simply saying that this was the voltage VI", 
    "between the gate terminal and ground.", 
    "So now, I can stick my MOSFET in there, which is exactly", 
    "this circuit.", 
    "But what I can do is once I'm told that it's in the", 
    "saturation region operation--", 
    "and recall, it's in saturation region operation when VGS is", 
    "greater than or equal to VT, and when VDS is greater than", 
    "or equal to VGS minus VT.", 
    "When VDS is large enough, then saturation region applies.", 
    "And in that region, as I promised you, I can replace", 
    "the MOSFET with its current source equivalent, which is a", 
    "dependent current source.", 
    "And the current iDS that goes through it is given by the", 
    "relation K divided by 2 times VI minus VT all squared.", 
    "And again, remember, this is true for saturation region", 
    "operation, which means that VGS greater than or equal to", 
    "VT and VDS for the MOSFET greater than or equal", 
    "to VGS minus VT.", 
    "Which is the same as VI greater than or equal to VT", 
    "and V0 greater than or equal to VI minus.", 
    "So I can go ahead and analyze the MOSFET amplifier, but I", 
    "replace the MOSFET with its current source model.", 
    "And really, I'm going to be repeating what I've done", 
    "before with the abstract dependent source.", 
    "Just that I'm going to be referring back and forth to", 
    "the MOSFET and to saturation region operation.", 
    "So we look at two ways of analyzing circuits like this.", 
    "We will look at the first method, which is", 
    "a analytical method.", 
    "And, as you've seen before, the second method will be a", 
    "graphical method.", 
    "Let's go and look at these two methods.", 
    "We will refer to this equation.", 
    "So let me label that as A. I'm going to", 
    "come back to it later."
