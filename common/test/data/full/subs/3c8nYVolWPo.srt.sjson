    "PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL: All right, hopefully you got a", 
    "chance to try this out for yourself, try out writing down", 
    "the characteristic equation by yourselves.", 
    "Let me go ahead and solve it for you here.", 
    "So what we did was, as step 2A, the first of a four-step", 
    "method from 2A to 2D, as step 2A, we guessed a solution of", 
    "the form Ae raised to st. And I want to substitute that into", 
    "the homogeneous equation.", 
    "OK, so what do I get?", 
    "So when substituting in, I get LC.", 
    "That doesn't change.", 
    "And then, if I differentiate this twice, what do I get?", 
    "Well, A stays here unchanged.", 
    "And if I differentiate it twice, I get s squared e", 
    "raised to st plus vH, which is straight e raised to st. And", 
    "that is equal to 0.", 
    "So now I can slash and burn here, so in this particular", 
    "situation, ignoring the trivial A equals 0 case, so I", 
    "cancel out A. I cancel out e raised to st. And", 
    "what am I left with?", 
    "I am left with LC s squared plus 1 equals 0.", 
    "So here is an equation.", 
    "So s must satisfy this equation for Ae raised to st", 
    "to be a solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "This equation here in s is called a", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "We will see later that this is an", 
    "extremely important equation.", 
    "In solving first- and second-order systems, once you", 
    "write down this equation, it can pretty much tell you all", 
    "that you want to know--", 
    "that is, almost all that you want to know--", 
    "about the form of the solution and the", 
    "dynamics of the system.", 
    "It's an extremely, extremely important equation, and you", 
    "will see that in a second.", 
    "So let's continue down the path and go", 
    "to the second step.", 
    "So the second step was to really write down the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "So 2B was to write the characteristic equation.", 
    "So we wrote that as LC s squared plus 1 equals 0.", 
    "And so that implies that s squared is equal", 
    "to minus 1 by LC.", 
    "So as I promised earlier, this was the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "In terms of this four-step process of the global step 2,", 
    "I've just done step 2B, which is I've written the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "Next, let me go to step 2C.", 
    "So step 2C will be to develop the roots of the", 
    "characteristic equation, roots of the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "So in this case, s squared equals minus 1 by LC.", 
    "And so I can write down the roots right away.", 
    "So now, this is where we begin getting into just a little", 
    "teensy bit of complex algebra.", 
    "And so you may want to go to Appendix C of the textbook.", 
    "So let me just write down Appendix C of text for a", 
    "review of complex algebra.", 
    "So remember, the notation j is the notation for the square", 
    "root of minus 1.", 
    "If j is the square root of minus 1, then the roots of the", 
    "characteristic equation s squared equals minus 1 by LC", 
    "will be given by s is equal to plus or minus j square", 
    "root of 1 by LC.", 
    "So here, if the minus 1 did not exist, s would be plus or", 
    "minus the square root of 1 by LC.", 
    "So if the minus sign did not exist, s would simply be", 
    "square root of 1 by LC, plus or minus that.", 
    "Now, since a minus 1 exists, I stick in the square root of", 
    "minus 1 out here, which is j.", 
    "So those are the roots of my characteristic equation, plus", 
    "or minus j square root of 1 by LC.", 
    "Now, in terms of notation, I use square root", 
    "of 1 by LC a lot.", 
    "So I'm going to use another little piece of notation.", 
    "I'm going to use omega 0 as 1 by LC.", 
    "I'm going to use omega 0 a lot or rather, use square", 
    "of 1 by LC a lot.", 
    "So I'm going to denote that as omega 0.", 
    "And so by doing so, I get s equals plus or minus j.", 
    "And by replacing square root of 1 by LC by omega", 
    "0, I get omega 0.", 
    "So that's my step 2C.", 
    "So the roots of my characteristic equation are", 
    "plus or minus j omega 0.", 
    "Omega 0 is square root of 1 by LC.", 
    "So I'm going to box a few of these things here.", 
    "These are extraordinarily important.", 
    "You will see these 346 times, at least, in the", 
    "rest of this course.", 
    "You will see characteristic equations a lot.", 
    "That's very, very important.", 
    "You will see omega 0, which is the square root", 
    "of 1 by LC, a lot.", 
    "Omega is a frequency.", 
    "And you will see what this frequency as it relates to the", 
    "square root of 1 by the inductance times the", 
    "capacitance.", 
    "You will see that a lot.", 
    "The roots of the characteristic equation, s", 
    "equals plus or minus j omega 0, you will see that a lot.", 
    "So if you want to take 30 seconds and simply memorize", 
    "omega 0 equals square root of 1 by LC, that would really,", 
    "really behoove you.", 
    "All right, so that's step 2C.", 
    "I've gotten the roots of the characteristic equation.", 
    "Next, let me go ahead and do step 2D.", 
    "Step 2D simply involves writing the general solution", 
    "to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "Recall I'm still working on the four-step process for the", 
    "homogeneous equation, where step 2A", 
    "was to assume a solution.", 
    "So that was step 2A.", 
    "Step 2B was write the characteristic equation.", 
    "Step 2C was develop the roots of the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "And step 2D is to write down the general solution to the", 
    "homogeneous equation.", 
    "So notice that this is not yet the final", 
    "solution that we want.", 
    "This is just a general solution to", 
    "the homogeneous equation.", 
    "I still have to fold in the particular solution and use", 
    "all my initial conditions to figure out all the", 
    "constants and stuff.", 
    "So this is just a general solution.", 
    "So I have two roots.", 
    "And so I can form the general solution by combining the two", 
    "roots as follows.", 
    "So recall, my solution assumption was Ae raised to", 
    "st. So the general solution to the homogeneous equation,", 
    "folding in both the roots, would be to use A1e raised to", 
    "st.", 
    "But s, one of the roots, is j omega 0 t.", 
    "So from s, I use j omega 0, because for Ae raised to st to", 
    "be a solution, the roots for s, s must be plus or", 
    "minus j omega 0.", 
    "So A1e raised to j omega 0 t is one solution.", 
    "And the second one is the other root, Ae raised to minus", 
    "j omega 0 t.", 
    "So this is the general solution to", 
    "the homogeneous equation.", 
    "And I've developed that by simply adding in the solution", 
    "corresponding to both the roots, A1e raised to j omega 0", 
    "t and A2e raised to minus j omega 0 t, which correspond to", 
    "these two roots.", 
    "So let's keep that in mind, and we will use", 
    "that quite a bit.", 
    "So I just want to be sure you're not confused so far.", 
    "Recall, solving the differential equation involved", 
    "three steps.", 
    "Write the particular, write the homogeneous, and then sum", 
    "up particular and homogeneous.", 
    "Now, homogeneous solution was step 2.", 
    "And I said step 2 itself was a four-substep process--", 
    "2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D.", 
    "And so here on this page, I have summarized the four-step", 
    "process, where the first step was write down a solution of", 
    "the form Ae raised to st. Write the characteristic", 
    "equation down.", 
    "Get the roots of the characteristic equation.", 
    "And then you write the general solution to the homogeneous", 
    "equation by using both of these roots in", 
    "the following manner.", 
    "So that's the general solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "As a next step, I will go to step 3 of the solution to the", 
    "differential equations.", 
    "And there, we will add up the particular", 
    "and homogeneous solutions."
