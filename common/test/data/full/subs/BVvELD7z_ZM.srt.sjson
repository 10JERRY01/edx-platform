    "SPEAKER: All right, thus far I took you", 
    "through two of the cases.", 
    "One was the alpha greater than omega 0, which was the", 
    "overdamped case.", 
    "And then I took you through alpha less than omega 0, which", 
    "was the underdamped case.", 
    "Now let me take you through the critically damped case.", 
    "You could read more about this in Section", 
    "13.2.3 of the textbook.", 
    "Just as a quick reminder, alpha being greater than omega", 
    "0 was the overdamped case.", 
    "Alpha less than omega 0 cause the underdamped case.", 
    "In this case, the quantity of the square root sign became", 
    "negative, which gave me the imaginary part.", 
    "And alpha equals omega 0 is the critically damped case.", 
    "So in this situation I'm not going to do any math for you.", 
    "I'll just give you some intuition as to how the wave", 
    "form will look in this situation.", 
    "So he's t, here's 0, and this is v of t.", 
    "Let's say this is VI.", 
    "Let me change colors.", 
    "Let's start with the overdamped", 
    "case, looked like this.", 
    "Let's call that no ringing, no oscillations, just straight", 
    "overdamped case.", 
    "OK, we saw that as a first step.", 
    "So we looked at the underdamped case.", 
    "And for the underdamped case, notice that I had these", 
    "sinusoidal oscillations that went like this.", 
    "So this was my underdamped case.", 
    "So overdamped and underdamped.", 
    "So where do you expect to critically damped case to be?", 
    "So for the critically damped case, here is what", 
    "I'm going to get.", 
    "And clearly, for these real circuits, I expect it to be", 
    "somewhere between the overdamped case and the", 
    "underdamped case.", 
    "So realistically, here is what it is going to look like.", 
    "So it's going to go like this.", 
    "It's going to go up here and it starts to ring, but blip,", 
    "then it comes down.", 
    "And this is what is going to look like.", 
    "It's going to go up pretty rapidly and get a little blip", 
    "as if it's trying to start bringing, but that's it.", 
    "And that is where it ends up.", 
    "So this is the critically damped case.", 
    "So I won't go and do the math.", 
    "But you can try it out yourselves.", 
    "But I just want to give you an insight as to what the wave", 
    "form for the critically damped case looked like.", 
    "OK, so we are now about to wrap it up.", 
    "I'm going to lead you through some really, really fun stuff.", 
    "We are pretty much done with the grubby math part of it.", 
    "And hopefully we will have some fun going ahead.", 
    "It's really important that you saw all of the stuff that you", 
    "saw until now.", 
    "We will look at intuitive methods to do the", 
    "same kind of thing."
