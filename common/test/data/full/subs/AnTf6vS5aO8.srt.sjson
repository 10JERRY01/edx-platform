    "SPEAKER 1: 6.002x, as I\nmentioned earlier, is the", 
    "first course in a typical\nEE or EECS", 
    "curriculum as it is at MIT.", 
    "So before we start, I&#39;d like to\nspend some time discussing", 
    "where exactly, such a circuits\nand electronics course and the", 
    "content that it teaches\nfits within the", 
    "grand scheme of things.", 
    "We will start by trying\nto understand, what is", 
    "engineering?", 
    "Well, engineering is the\npurposeful use of science,", 
    "where science, itself, is\nthe study of what is.", 
    "In other words, it&#39;s the\nstudy of nature.", 
    "With engineering, we\nare now focused on", 
    "what we make of nature.", 
    "It&#39;s what we build.", 
    "It&#39;s how we can use science\nto help humanity.", 
    "So then, where does\n6.002x fit in?", 
    "6.002x is about the gainful\nemployment of Maxwell&#39;s", 
    "equations, going all the way\nfrom electrons to digital", 
    "gates and op-amps.", 
    "As I mentioned earlier, just\nas engineering is the", 
    "purposeful use of science or\nnature, 6.002x is about the", 
    "use of Maxwell&#39;s equations.", 
    "Now, when you have nature,\nthat is what is.", 
    "So you can study nature\nand that is science.", 
    "You&#39;re not allowed to\nchange anything.", 
    "With engineering, you are\nlooking to build cool stuff,", 
    "things that can help humanity.", 
    "And in order to build such\nstuff, we often abstract", 
    "nature, or we abstract\nwhat is into laws.", 
    "And Maxwell&#39;s equations are laws\nthat govern the behavior", 
    "of one part of nature.", 
    "And 6.002x is about employing\nMaxwell&#39;s equations to build", 
    "cool systems that can\nhelp humanity.", 
    "Now, let&#39;s try to get a better\nhandle on exactly what we mean", 
    "by looking at how\nnature behaves.", 
    "Or at least, nature\nas described", 
    "by Maxwell&#39;s equations.", 
    "And let&#39;s see how that will lead\nto building really useful", 
    "systems that can\nhelp humanity.", 
    "So so let&#39;s put nature and what\nis on the left-hand side.", 
    "And on the right-hand side,\nlet&#39;s put down what are the", 
    "kind of things that we\nmay want to build", 
    "that will help humanity.", 
    "So computer mice\nare an example.", 
    "Cool devices like your iPad or\nyour RAZR phone are useful", 
    "devices, space shuttle,\nstereo systems,", 
    "sonar, even Angry Birds.", 
    "So let&#39;s see, so how do we take\nnature, what is available", 
    "to us, and how do we build,\nas engineers,", 
    "really useful systems?", 
    "So we start with nature.", 
    "That&#39;s what we are given.", 
    "So what we could do is look\nat how nature behaves by", 
    "performing sets of\nexperiments.", 
    "So we could perform experiments", 
    "and build some tables.", 
    "So as one example, in the area\nthat we are concerned about,", 
    "we can measure voltages\nand currents.", 
    "So for various voltages, I can\nmeasure currents that arise", 
    "from those voltages.", 
    "So I could have 4 volts and\nso on and so forth.", 
    "I can apply voltages to some\nmaterial and measure the", 
    "current that flows through\nthose materials.", 
    "In the same manner, I can\ncollect tables and tables and", 
    "reams and reams of data to\ncharacterize all kinds of", 
    "parts of nature, and have reams\nand reams of this data.", 
    "So I could take reams of this\ndata, and somehow try to build", 
    "those systems based on all those\nproperties of nature.", 
    "Now, that is clearly a\nherculean, if anything,", 
    "ludicrous task.", 
    "So what do we do?", 
    "This is just too hard.", 
    "And nobody sits down with reams\nof data looking at how", 
    "nature behaves and\nbuild systems.", 
    "What do we do instead?", 
    "What we do, as engineers, is we\nstart by building laws or", 
    "abstractions that succinctly\ndescribe how nature behaves.", 
    "So, for example, I can take\nthese measurements that I made", 
    "of voltages and currents,\nand I can say, a-ha.", 
    "I can describe certain\nmaterials that behave", 
    "according to certain laws, and\nwrite an equation, such as v", 
    "is equal to ri, which is Ohm&#39;s\nLaw, that governs certain", 
    "types of devices.", 
    "Other phenomena are described\nby Maxwell&#39;s equations.", 
    "And these equations now, whether\nit&#39;s Maxwell&#39;s, Ohm&#39;s,", 
    "or classes of other equations,\nthink of these as succinct", 
    "expressions or learning from the\nreams and reams and rooms", 
    "and rooms of data.", 
    "So here, these equations can be\nthought of as abstractions", 
    "for those tables of data.", 
    "And just imagine a simple law\nlike Ohm&#39;s Law, v is equal to", 
    "ri, which you&#39;ve learned about\nin your high school advanced", 
    "physics courses.", 
    "Now, in one little, simple\nequation v equals ri, can", 
    "describe reams and reams of data\nthat govern the behavior", 
    "of a certain class of devices.", 
    "So we have simplified our\nlives quite a bit.", 
    "But still, trying to use\nMaxwell&#39;s equations to develop", 
    "Angry Birds, or to develop\ncomputers and so on, is just a", 
    "mind-numbing task.", 
    "Just can&#39;t be done.", 
    "So what do we do instead?", 
    "So remember, we have engineers,\nand our goal is to", 
    "build these systems at the end\nthat will help humanity.", 
    "So what we will do is we will\nmake some assumptions that you", 
    "will see in the rest\nof this lecture.", 
    "And by making certain classes of\nassumptions, we will build", 
    "what is called the lumped\ncircuit abstraction.", 
    "Now, the lumped circuit\nabstraction, we have a set of", 
    "lumped elements, or discrete\nelements, such as resistors,", 
    "capacitors, voltage sources,\ninductors, transistors like", 
    "the MOSFET switches, and\nso on and so forth.", 
    "So now, other than using\nequations and equations, we", 
    "build some abstractions and\nbuild some discrete devices", 
    "that we shall use in\nbuilding systems.", 
    "Now, we could take these simple\ndevices and go ahead", 
    "and build computers.", 
    "But nobody does it that way.", 
    "When you build a computer,\nsuch as a modern", 
    "microprocessor, such a\nmicroprocessor might have 10", 
    "billion elements in it.", 
    "There&#39;s no way we can sit around\ndealing with resistors", 
    "and MOSFETs in quantities of 10\nbillion, and individually", 
    "build systems using that.", 
    "So what we do is, again, apply\nthe process of abstraction.", 
    "We abstract out the behavior of", 
    "collections of these elements.", 
    "And the next abstractions we\nwill make in this course is", 
    "the simple amplified\nabstraction.", 
    "We learn a lot more about\nthis as we go on.", 
    "This amplifier may have dozens,\nif not hundreds of", 
    "these lumped elements\ninside them.", 
    "But then we will go and continue\nto work with those", 
    "amplifiers, which are abstract\nconglomerates of a lot of", 
    "these elements.", 
    "So at this point, life can take\na couple of turns once we", 
    "build a simple amplifier\nabstraction.", 
    "So one thing we could do from\nthere is use that to build", 
    "what we call the operational\namplifier abstraction.", 
    "And then, using that, we can\nbuild even more complex", 
    "system, such as filters.", 
    "Filters are able to process data\nin various ways and give", 
    "us a set of outputs that might\nsuit our purposes in", 
    "engineering certain classes\nof systems.", 
    "Then we build the next level of\nsystems, analog subsystems,", 
    "such as oscillators, modulators,\nRF amplifiers,", 
    "power supplies, and so on.", 
    "And then, those would be used\nin systems like the space", 
    "shuttle, or phones, and\nthings like that.", 
    "So that is one whole set of\ndirections that we can take.", 
    "Think of that as the\nanalog direction.", 
    "But we can take a second\ndirection, that is along the", 
    "lines of the digital\nabstraction.", 
    "So in this world, we will\nmake a different set of", 
    "assumptions.", 
    "And you will see that what we\nwill do is rather than look at", 
    "a continuous set of values,\nanalog values, we will simply", 
    "look at dividing up all values\ninto two distinct", 
    "quantities, 1 and 0.", 
    "And by doing so, we will build\nup what we call the digital", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "And the first set of components\nwe will build in", 
    "the digital abstraction are\nwhat are called gates.", 
    "Following that, we will build\neven more complex logic,", 
    "combinational logic.", 
    "And then, using combinational\nlogic, we will apply some time", 
    "[? keeping ?] signals, like\nclocks and so on, and build", 
    "what we call clock digital\nsystems. And abstractly, these", 
    "clock digital systems will be\nused to build even more", 
    "complicated and useful\nsystems, such as", 
    "microprocessors.", 
    "So, for example, there the\nabstraction we make is called", 
    "the instruction set abstraction,\nor ISA, I-S-A.", 
    "And the instructions of\nabstraction will allow us to", 
    "build an even more complicated\nclass of systems that are", 
    "characterized by their\ninstruction sets.", 
    "So we can have the MIPS\ninstruction set, we can have", 
    "the Pentium instruction set,\nand so on and so forth.", 
    "Following that, we will build\nanother level of abstraction.", 
    "Try to build systems using\ninstructions in the ISA of a", 
    "microprocessor is just way\ntoo complicated still.", 
    "So we build higher\nlevel languages.", 
    "And I&#39;m sure many of you are\nfamiliar with languages such", 
    "as Java, Python, CC++,\nand so on.", 
    "Following that, we build\nsoftware systems or hardware", 
    "systems, such as operating\nsystems, and web browsers, and", 
    "things of that sort.", 
    "And then, we combine.", 
    "We have the big combination\nwhere we take the subsystems", 
    "we put together both from the\nanalog dimension, such as", 
    "power supplies and so on, and\npieces of computer hardware,", 
    "such as oscillators.", 
    "And then from the digital side,\nwe take both software", 
    "systems and hardware systems\nlike microprocessors and", 
    "combine them.", 
    "And after we combine them, we\nend up with very interesting", 
    "systems like games and so on on\nyour handheld devices, or", 
    "the space shuttle,\nfor instance.", 
    "Now, what does 6.002 cover?", 
    "So 6.002 will help you make the\ntransition from physics", 
    "and take it all the way into\nanalog and digital subsystems.", 
    "So 6.002x will take you from\nphysics laws, make the jump to", 
    "engineering, where we will\nabstract these physics laws", 
    "and properties into lumped\ndevices, build the lumped", 
    "circuit abstraction, and then\ntake the one path on the", 
    "analog direction and build\nanalog subsystems. And then,", 
    "we will also go down a fair bit\ndown a digital path and", 
    "take you all the way to\nprimitive clock digital", 
    "components.", 
    "And the reason we cover this\namount of ground in 6.002x is", 
    "really, really to emphasize the\npoint that the foundations", 
    "of both the analog and the\ndigital world are the same.", 
    "The foundations are the same\nlumped circuit elements.", 
    "And whose foundations are your\nbasic laws of physics, such as", 
    "Maxwell&#39;s equation.", 
    "And of course, the foundations\nof those laws is", 
    "nature as you see it.", 
    "So there you have it.", 
    "This should give you a sense\nof the grand scheme", 
    "of things in 6.002x.", 
    "And for that matter, in pretty\nmuch an entire EECS", 
    "curriculum.", 
    "So just to show you why this\nlarge map here pretty much", 
    "covers the typical EECS\ncurriculum, notice that a", 
    "course at MIT such as 6.061\nwill cover power supplies.", 
    "A course such as 6.004 or 6.846\nwill cover computer", 
    "architecture and parallel\ncomputing.", 
    "A course such as 6.002 will\ncover introduction to", 
    "programming.", 
    "A course such as 6.033 will\ncover basic software systems.", 
    "And there will be many, many,\nmany other more advanced", 
    "courses that will cover the\nfurther advanced components.", 
    "Nowt o get a sense of many of\nthese follow-on courses, you", 
    "can get a sneak peak of\nthe material at OCW,", 
    "OpenCourseWare, or over the next\nfew semesters, we shall", 
    "make many of these courses\navailable on MITX as well.",
