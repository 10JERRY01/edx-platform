    "SPEAKER 1: So let me show you a quick demo and try to point", 
    "out on a graph some of the characteristics that relate to", 
    "the matter we've been talking about so far.", 
    "OK, so what I show here are these curves for the MOSFET.", 
    "This is V0.", 
    "And this is IDS.", 
    "OK, this is the zero point.", 
    "This line up here--", 
    "ignore this line down here.", 
    "This line up here corresponds to the output voltage, VL, OK?", 
    "What I'm going to do now is through some", 
    "careful circuit hacking.", 
    "I'm going to show you a load line and show you the bias", 
    "point and show you how the bias point can be moved up and", 
    "down by changing the input voltage, which changes the", 
    "corresponding output voltage.", 
    "It's hardly visible up there.", 
    "Is it there?", 
    "OK, it's not really clear.", 
    "But notice, as I increase my input--", 
    "I'm increasing my input--", 
    "my output keeps coming down.", 
    "All right, as you can see, as I change the input value, the", 
    "output operating point changes.", 
    "And the dot out there articulates a load line, OK?", 
    "I guess I have to believe that there is a dot out there.", 
    "OK, so the next one I'll do is show you some more fun stuff.", 
    "What I'll do, instead of having just a dot, by having a", 
    "DC voltage, let me apply an input sinusoid.", 
    "OK, so if I apply an input sinusoid at some bias, then I", 
    "should see an articulation of the corresponding region of", 
    "the load line corresponding to the input.", 
    "So as you can see here, now the bottom", 
    "line here is my input.", 
    "And this is my output.", 
    "And notice that this is the region of the load line", 
    "articulated when the input is of this magnitude, OK?", 
    "Now let's have some fun.", 
    "As I increase my input, you can see that a larger portion", 
    "of the load line is articulated, right?", 
    "There you go.", 
    "And as I decrease my input, a smaller region of the load", 
    "line is articulated.", 
    "OK, let's leave it here for a moment.", 
    "And what I'll do next is--", 
    "this is the region here that we're looking at-- let me", 
    "increase the bias.", 
    "So if I increase the bias, if I increase VI, what do you", 
    "think should happen to this line here?", 
    "Well, if I increase the bias, the line should go up, right?", 
    "Because remember the dot?", 
    "The dot is in the middle of this thing here.", 
    "If I increase the bias, this should move up here.", 
    "OK, so one is that line moves up.", 
    "Do you expect anything else to happen to that line?", 
    "SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Pardon?", 
    "SPEAKER 2: You increase it?", 
    "SPEAKER 1: It increases.", 
    "Exactly.", 
    "So if I increase the bias point to here, then this must", 
    "also increase because my gain is increased.", 
    "OK, let me do that.", 
    "So let me increase the input bias.", 
    "Indeed, notice that the region of the load line articulated", 
    "is larger now.", 
    "Let me decrease the bias.", 
    "And notice that, because the gain is smaller, the little", 
    "segment shown is also smaller, OK?", 
    "So I've shown you two things so far.", 
    "One is that as I increase my bias, the line indeed rises", 
    "up, corresponding to a higher value for the operating point,", 
    "the input operating point.", 
    "And the second is that I get a larger swing in the output, as", 
    "I increase the bias, OK?", 
    "For those like me who are visually challenged in terms", 
    "of viewing that little dot out there, let me get some audio", 
    "so you can actually hear the sinusoidal tone.", 
    "It's a bit annoying.", 
    "[TONE]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So as I reduce the bias, the gain is decreased.", 
    "As I increase the bias--", 
    "[TONE GETS LOUDER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: OK, as I increase the bias, you can see that the", 
    "gain is increased and the tone is louder, OK?", 
    "Let's have some more fun.", 
    "And let's play some music now.", 
    "And what I'm going to show you with the music is-- the reason", 
    "I play the music is not just for fun.", 
    "Well, it's 85% fun and 50% learning.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So can we turn it on for a second?", 
    "So what I'd like to do is--", 
    "so I will just play the music.", 
    "The reason I'm playing the music, for that 15%, is so you", 
    "can listen to distortion, OK?", 
    "I want you to listen to the distortion.", 
    "That is, when the articulation is here, you're aren't going", 
    "to get much distortion, OK?", 
    "But as I get into cutoff, you should be hearing a bunch of", 
    "distortion.", 
    "Similarly, as you get into the triode region, you should also", 
    "be getting distortion because the amplification from being", 
    "somewhat non-linear here becomes highly non-linear at", 
    "those two points, OK?", 
    "So let's just play the signal.", 
    "[MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So the amplitude increases by", 
    "increasing the bias.", 
    "[MUSIC BECOMES LOUDER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: OK, now you should hear the volume go down and", 
    "distortion.", 
    "[MUSIC GETS QUIETER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So notice now that the bias", 
    "point is way down here.", 
    "So the gain is very low.", 
    "And plus, there's distortion because of cutoff.", 
    "Now what I'll do is blast it up here.", 
    "And you'll see that the volume has gone up, but then you see", 
    "distortion again.", 
    "And let's see if you can stand the volume here.", 
    "[MUSIC GETS LOUDER WITH BREAKS IN PLAYBACK]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And the CD doesn't like that.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So notice that, as I went up here, the volume kept", 
    "increasing.", 
    "The volume kept increasing because the gain kept", 
    "increasing.", 
    "But as I got into the triode region, I began to lose my", 
    "gain because, remember, the amplifier doesn't have gain in", 
    "the triode region.", 
    "And when that [? marched up ?] in this triode region, then we", 
    "also get a bunch of distortion out there, OK?", 
    "So finally, it turns out that as people-- people were", 
    "building amplifiers is--", 
    "I think this was in the mid- to late '50's and", 
    "'60's and so on.", 
    "They said, man, the electrical engineers ain't going to get", 
    "their thing right.", 
    "So they invented a new kind of music which is much more", 
    "tolerant to distortion.", 
    "And I'll play that music for you.", 
    "It's called hard rock.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: I challenge you to tell me it's distorting.", 
    "[HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Sounds good to me.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "All right, that'll be it.", 
    "Thank you."
