    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so the time constant here is", 
    "simply CGS times RTH.", 
    "OK, that's my time constant, or RTH times CGS.", 
    "OK, so that's my time constant, and my circuit is", 
    "going to decay from VS. My node B is going to decay from", 
    "voltage VS to VTH.", 
    "I can also write down an analytic expression for VB.", 
    "And recall, that is governed by the", 
    "exponential decay, RLCGS.", 
    "It's not RL, actually.", 
    "The time constant is RTH.", 
    "So it is RTHCGS.", 
    "And notice that this value decay is VS minus VTH decay.", 
    "So I put VS minus VTH here, And the final value, the final", 
    "offset is VTH, so I write VTH here.", 
    "So that was pretty easy, not hard at all.", 
    "So by intuition, notice that I said the form was the", 
    "exponential decay, so e raised to minus t divided by RTHCGS.", 
    "And then the decay was of this value here, VS minus VTH.", 
    "And so this gave me the decaying part of the curve.", 
    "And it decayed to VTH, and so I added a VTH towards the end.", 
    "So this was the form that looked like so.", 
    "So that is the falling wave form at B. So as my next step,", 
    "giving the falling wave form at B, I need to figure out", 
    "what is the actual delay, tf, at the node B. So let's go", 
    "ahead and compute that right away.", 
    "So I can figure out the falling delay at B very", 
    "quickly from the expression for VB.", 
    "But let me repeat that for you, just as reference.", 
    "So I wrote down VB as the lowest voltage at [? Ven ?]", 
    "2, VTH, the node B, [? Ven ?]", 
    "2, VTH.", 
    "And VS minus VTH here, e raised to minus", 
    "t, divide by RTHCGS.", 
    "So falling delay at tf, what is that?", 
    "What is my falling delay tf?", 
    "Well, it is the time that it takes for VB to", 
    "fall from VS to VOL.", 
    "So the reason tf is the time it takes for VB to fall from", 
    "VS to VOL is that VOL is a logically valid low voltage,", 
    "and so therefore that's the time I need to measure.", 
    "So in terms of the graph, recall this is VB, this is", 
    "time, and this is what the wave form looked like.", 
    "This is VTH, and this was VH.", 
    "So somewhere along the way, I would hit VOL.", 
    "So this time here, from 0.", 
    "So this time here is tf.", 
    "The time it takes for VB to go from VS down to VOL.", 
    "So it'll take a lot longer.", 
    "It'll take forever to get to VTH.", 
    "It takes infinite time to get to VTH, but it gets close to", 
    "VTH not too much later.", 
    "But really, I just need to compute the value of time for", 
    "which VB goes to VOL, because after VOL, these are all valid", 
    "low values.", 
    "So once it crosses VOL, it's a valid low", 
    "value, and I am done.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So what I'll do is I'll replace VB with VOL and", 
    "compute the time, t, it takes for that node to reach the", 
    "value, VOL.", 
    "So that's VTH.", 
    "And e to the minus t, that's a falling delay, RTHCGS.", 
    "So it takes time tf to go from VS to VOL, and I", 
    "take VOL out here.", 
    "So you can go ahead and simplify this.", 
    "So you bring VTH to the left-hand side, so you", 
    "get VOL minus VTH.", 
    "And you divide the whole thing by VS minus VTH.", 
    "So you get e raised to minus tf/RTHCGS equals VOL minus VTH", 
    "divided by VS minus VTH.", 
    "And then I take the natural log on both sides and multiply", 
    "it throughout by RTHCGS.", 
    "It gives me tf being equal to minus RTHCGS times the natural", 
    "log of VOL minus VTH divided by VS minus VTH.", 
    "Now, you shouldn't worry about the negative sign here,", 
    "because in the natural log, notice that the numerator is", 
    "less than the denominator.", 
    "So when you take the natural log, you get", 
    "another negative sign.", 
    "So that negative sign will cancel with this negative", 
    "sign, yielding a positive time value.", 
    "So that will be your falling delay.", 
    "So finally, let me use a similar set of numbers, as we", 
    "did for the rise time, and see what the falling delay is", 
    "going to look like.", 
    "All right, so let me go back and, just as I did for the", 
    "rising delay, let me pick, as an example, RL equals 1", 
    "kiloohm, like before, of VS equals 5 volts, like before.", 
    "And let me pick RON to be a low value, 10 ohms. The same,", 
    "CGS, of 0.1 picofarads.", 
    "And let me assume that my static discipline has a VOL", 
    "given by 1 volt.", 
    "Let me also redraw the original circuit, because I", 
    "want to grab some intuition from it.", 
    "So this was my VS. This was my RL.", 
    "This was RON.", 
    "And this was the node B. This was VB, and this was CGS.", 
    "And so it started out at VS, and then it decayed all the", 
    "way down to the steady state value, VS divided by RON,", 
    "divided by RL plus RON.", 
    "So first of all, let me find out what RTH is.", 
    "The Thevenin equivalent is simply the parallel resistance", 
    "looking out here.", 
    "Notice that RON is 10 ohms, while RL is a", 
    "much larger 1 kiloohm.", 
    "So RTH being the parallel resistance of RL and RON is", 
    "more or less that of the much smaller resistance, so that's", 
    "more or less 10 ohms. It's 10 ohm in parallel with 1", 
    "kiloohms is more or less 10 ohms.", 
    "Similarly, what is VTH?", 
    "So VTH is the voltage here given by the", 
    "voltage divider action.", 
    "So if this is 5 volts, then 5 volts, with the divider action", 
    "across 1 kiloohm and 10 ohms, is almost 0 here.", 
    "Since RON is very small, this is virtually 0 volts.", 
    "And not surprising, I pick a low value for these", 
    "resistances here for the on resistance of my MOSFETs, so", 
    "that I can drive this value to be low and get a very low VOL.", 
    "So what is tf?", 
    "So my falling delay, tf, is simply minus RTH, which is", 
    "minus 10, times CGS, which is 0.1 times 10 to the minus 12.", 
    "That can be just 0.1 picofarads.", 
    "The natural log of VOL minus VTH, so VOL minus VTH divided", 
    "by VS minus VTH.", 
    "So what's that value?", 
    "So that is VOL is 1 volt.", 
    "VTH is more or less 0.", 
    "VS is 5 volts.", 
    "And VTH is more or less 0.", 
    "So tf is simply 10 times 0.1 raised to 10 to the minus 12,", 
    "a natural log of 1 divided by 5.", 
    "If you go into this calculation, this comes out to", 
    "approximately 1.6 picoseconds.", 
    "And here again, it's always fun to compare this value that", 
    "I got for tf with the time constant of this equivalent", 
    "circuit here, which is RTHCGS, which is what?", 
    "So RTH is 10 ohms, and CGS is 0.1 picofarads.", 
    "And so that is simply 10 times 1 picofarad is 1 picoseconds.", 
    "So 10 and the 0.1 cancel out, and ohms", 
    "and capacitance there.", 
    "So I get to a time unit for RTHCGS, and that is 1", 
    "picoseconds.", 
    "Again, notice the amazing similarity between the RC time", 
    "constant and the falling delay that I've computed.", 
    "Just going to show again that, again, that RTH is itself a", 
    "good indicator of the delays.", 
    "The second important point I wanted to point out is, notice", 
    "how small this delay is, 1 picosecond.", 
    "Why is that delay so small compared to the rise time?", 
    "The rise time, if you recall for our circuit, was in the", 
    "order of 1 nanosecond.", 
    "But the fall time is only 1 picosecond.", 
    "Why is that?", 
    "Well, the reason that is so small is the time constant of", 
    "the falling delay circuit is much, much smaller.", 
    "And the reason is that, for the falling circuit, the", 
    "MOSFET gets turned on, which is why this RON comes into", 
    "play, while for the circuit with the MOSFET is off and", 
    "this was rising, there's just the RL.", 
    "So in circuits like this, it is not surprising that the", 
    "wave form that you noticed had looked like this.", 
    "It had risen very slowly but seemed to have fallen really", 
    "fast, risen very slowly, fallen really fast, and so on.", 
    "The reason it fell very fast was because of the much", 
    "smaller time constant for the falling delay."
