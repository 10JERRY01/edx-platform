    "SPEAKER: I think that should be clear.", 
    "As a next step, let me go ahead and look at the second", 
    "kind of wave form.", 
    "So the second kind of wave form is where my VI, the final", 
    "value, is lower than the initial value.", 
    "OK, so just mark this the case 1.", 
    "In this case, VI is greater than v0.", 
    "For the second case where VI is less than", 
    "v0, what do I have?", 
    "Well, let's adopt the exact same principle.", 
    "Let's find the initial value.", 
    "Well, the initial value is v0, no surprises there.", 
    "What is the final value?", 
    "Well, in this case if v0 here is lower than vc, so in other", 
    "words, don't forget that VI is lower than v0.", 
    "And v0 is the initial value across the capacitor.", 
    "Then notice that current is going to start", 
    "flowing in this direction.", 
    "So if current flows in this direction, the capacitor is", 
    "going to discharge through the resistor", 
    "and the voltage source.", 
    "And if the capacity discharges, v0", 
    "what is going to decay.", 
    "What's the final value?", 
    "Well, the value here is VI, which is less than v0.", 
    "And ultimately, the capacitor keeps discharging until its", 
    "value equals VI.", 
    "At which point, there's no more current and the capacitor", 
    "then stays at VI.", 
    "So the final value in this case will be VI.", 
    "So if VI is less than v0, then VI is going to be here.", 
    "So this is step 1 as usual.", 
    "This is my step 2.", 
    "They're in different colors, so that", 
    "should be clear enough.", 
    "And then I need to pick, is it going to be shook or is it", 
    "going to be shook?", 
    "Is it going to be a decaying like this or is it", 
    "going to be going up?", 
    "Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?", 
    "It's going to be decaying like so.", 
    "Since VI is lower than v0, the capacitor voltage is going to", 
    "decay like so.", 
    "And this is the same, old time constant.", 
    "So that is pretty easy.", 
    "So this value here is VI where VI is less than v0.", 
    "So pretty straightforward.", 
    "All I have to do is find the initial value, the final", 
    "value, and then pick whether it rises or it decays.", 
    "And in this latter situation where it's decaying, vc can be", 
    "written straightforwardly as follows.", 
    "In this particular case, I have a decay.", 
    "Let me just make it clear.", 
    "It's of the form minus d over RC.", 
    "And in this case, the decay is this difference here.", 
    "This difference here is VO minus VI.", 
    "So it's VO minus VI.", 
    "And that difference decays with a time constant e raised", 
    "to minus t over RC.", 
    "So if I get a VO minus VI, that is decaying like so.", 
    "And then to that, you simply add the initial value.", 
    "OK", 
    "And what is the initial value here?", 
    "The initial value here is--", 
    "oh, it's not the intial value, I'm sorry.", 
    "If I get t equals 0 here, this goes to 1.", 
    "And so I get a VO minus VI here.", 
    "So notice that if this piece is this decay, but this decay", 
    "here is superimposed on top of this little offset here, and", 
    "that offset is VI.", 
    "So I mark my VI down here.", 
    "So this case is given by this exponential decay, and that is", 
    "VI, which is the little offset here.", 
    "And then it's the exponential decay of a value v0 minus VI.", 
    "And then this other situation, let me go back to blue here.", 
    "This other situation is of this form.", 
    "So all you have to do for these capacitive circuits is", 
    "actually very simple.", 
    "All you have to do is figure out initial and final values", 
    "based on the physics of the situation.", 
    "And then, simply decide that am I going to do this or am I", 
    "going to do with the time constant RC?", 
    "Pretty straightforward, not that hard at all.", 
    "Notice how I did not use differential equations", 
    "anywhere in that analysis, and I completely did it", 
    "intuitively.", 
    "OK.", 
    "As our next topic, we're now ready to apply what we've", 
    "learned to an inverter circuit.", 
    "And this is one of the key, key", 
    "applications of RC analysis.", 
    "So let's dive right into it.", 
    "This should be a lot of fun.", 
    "You will take all you've learned so far and by the end", 
    "of the sequence, I'm going to show you how you can estimate", 
    "the speed of modern microprocessors, simply based", 
    "on the techniques you've seen so far.", 
    "OK, so let's say I have an inverter that", 
    "drives another inverter.", 
    "This is A and this point is B. So this point is A and this", 
    "point is B. And let's say this is inverter x.", 
    "So inverter pair where this point here is A, this point is", 
    "B. And the first inverter is x.", 
    "All right, so let me go ahead and draw out", 
    "that circuit for you.", 
    "So in terms if I replace the MOSFETs and the resistors that", 
    "implement the inverter and sketch it out for you, this is", 
    "what it is going to look like.", 
    "There's my resistor.", 
    "There's my MOSFET.", 
    "And you've seen all this before.", 
    "And this is vs and this is some load resistor R. And this", 
    "is the input of the first inverter, so that is A. And", 
    "this is my first inverter x.", 
    "OK, this first inverter drives a second inverter.", 
    "The second inverter has a MOSFET.", 
    "And there is the load resistor R here.", 
    "This is vs. And this is my final output.", 
    "So if I call this output C, then this is my output C.", 
    "OK, so let me call this y, my second inverter.", 
    "This is my second inverter y.", 
    "And this is my point B. So I've just simply replaced my", 
    "inverters with their circuit equivalence.", 
    "Now, one of the things I'm going to do in addition is I'm", 
    "going to mark down the capacitor that's at the gate", 
    "of the MOSFET.", 
    "Notice that the gate of the MOSFET", 
    "behaves like a capacitor.", 
    "And so there is this funky capacitor that we have to deal", 
    "with that we did not quite expect.", 
    "Just to show it very clearly, let me go ahead and change", 
    "color to red and draw out that capacitor for you.", 
    "So this is my capacitor CGS.", 
    "So this is the capacitor that's from the gate.", 
    "And generally the capacitor from the gate is modeled as", 
    "the capacitor to source.", 
    "Now you can build much more complicated circuits.", 
    "You can add a capacitor from the gate to the drain.", 
    "You can a capacitor from the gate to the bulk region, and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "But in 6.002x, we will do something relatively simple.", 
    "We will simply model the capacitance of the MOSFET as a", 
    "capacitor from the gate to the drain.", 
    "And we will call it CGS as the capacitor from the gate of the", 
    "MOSFET to the source of the MOSFET.", 
    "Here is my gate.", 
    "This is my drain.", 
    "This is my source.", 
    "Now, Of course there's a capacitor between this gate", 
    "and this source as well.", 
    "But since I'm going to be focusing on this node here,", 
    "this one just for cleanliness, I'm just going to draw the", 
    "capacitor CGS between the gate and the source", 
    "of my inverter y.", 
    "And then, as a next step, I'm going to tell you that I need", 
    "to figure out the delay for the inverter in", 
    "the following situation.", 
    "There's really two delays.", 
    "One delay is what happens when, at the node B,", 
    "my signal is rising?", 
    "The second thing is, what happens at B when the signal", 
    "is falling?", 
    "So let's say the rise time when the signal is rising, or", 
    "the time it takes for the signal to reach a valid value", 
    "as it's rising, let's call that tr.", 
    "Let's call that the rising delay.", 
    "Similarly, let's say when B is falling from its current value", 
    "to a logically valid value, let me call that tf.", 
    "And let's call that a falling delay.", 
    "OK, rising delay and a falling delay.", 
    "As a first step, I will compute for us the rising", 
    "delay, tr, at B.", 
    "This rising delay, tr, at B happens when the wave form at", 
    "B is falling.", 
    "So when the wave form at B is going to be falling.", 
    "So that is going to happen in the following situation.", 
    "So the wave form at B will fall when the wave", 
    "form at A rises up.", 
    "So at A, if the voltage is vA, then let's say at A, my", 
    "voltage goes from 5 volts to 0 volts at time t equal to 0.", 
    "So let's say that at A, I go from a logical 1 to a logical", 
    "0 at A. And let's say that corresponds to voltage 5 volts", 
    "going to 0 volts at time t equals 0.", 
    "So at A, let's say I take a transition from 5 volts to 0", 
    "volts at time t equals 0.", 
    "And if this switches from a logical 1 to a logical 0,", 
    "notice that the output here of a switch from a logical 0", 
    "to a logical 1.", 
    "And so as it switches from a logical 0 to a logical 1, then", 
    "I'm going to figure out the rising delay at B.", 
    "Oh, looks like I'm nuts.", 
    "A rising delay is going to look like this.", 
    "It's not going to look like a falling delay.", 
    "It's going to be going up.", 
    "So I'm going to be figuring out the rising delay at point", 
    "B for an input vA that is a step from 5 volts to 0 volts.", 
    "OK, so before I go and do it, let me go back and revisit a", 
    "demo that I showed you earlier for an inverter pair showing", 
    "you the delays.", 
    "And just touch upon how the signal looks when it's rising", 
    "and falling at B. And then we'll go ahead and dive right", 
    "into how we compute the rising and falling delays."
