    "PROFESSOR: In the previous\nsegment, we looked at the", 
    "Thevenin method, which applied\nto linear circuits.", 
    "And in that method, I could take\nan arbitrary network, n,", 
    "containing a whole bunch of\nsources and resistors where", 
    "the current sources are\nvoltage sources.", 
    "And I could replace that with\nits Thevenin equivalent, where", 
    "the Thevenin equivalent pattern\nwas given by a voltage", 
    "source VTH.", 
    "in series with the\nresistance RTH.", 
    "Now one of the things that I\nwant you to think about in", 
    "circuits is that whenever you\nhave circuits containing", 
    "voltages and properties\ninvolving voltages, you can", 
    "immediately think of\ncomplimentary properties", 
    "involving current sources.", 
    "So much as I was able to replace\nan arbitrary network n", 
    "with its Thevenin equivalent,\nyou can think about replacing", 
    "the arbitrary network n with\nsome pattern involving a", 
    "current source.", 
    "And indeed, that method where\nyou replace an arbitrary", 
    "network with a pattern involving\na current source is", 
    "called the Norton method.", 
    "So in the Norton method, what\nwe do is we are able to", 
    "replace an arbitrary network n\nwith its Norton equivalent,", 
    "where the Norton equivalent\ncontains the current source IN", 
    "in parallel with the\nresistance RTH.", 
    "The current source in parallel\nwith RTH is a Norton pattern,", 
    "and you should contrast it\nwith the corresponding", 
    "Thevenin pattern.", 
    "So a voltage source in series\nwith a resistor is a Thevenin", 
    "pattern, and a current source\nin parallel with the", 
    "resistance is the\nNorton pattern.", 
    "So in the case of the Norton\npattern, which contains the", 
    "current source IN and the Norton\nresistance RN, in the", 
    "same manner that you defined\nthe Thevenin equivalent, we", 
    "can derive the Norton\nequivalent.", 
    "So to obtain the current IN,\nwhat you do is you obtain the", 
    "short circuit current\nseen at the port.", 
    "So recall for the Thevenin\nmethod, I open-circuited the", 
    "port here, and measured the\nvoltage, and that was my VTH.", 
    "So the Norton method, what I\ndo is I short circuit this", 
    "port and measure the current I.\nThat current is IN, or the", 
    "Norton current.", 
    "And then I can get a Norton\nresistance RN--", 
    "oh, I should say RN here-- the\nNorton resistance RN, which,", 
    "incidentally, is identical to\nthe Thevenin resistance RTH.", 
    "I can get that in the same\nmanner as I got RTH, which is", 
    "I shut off all the independent\nvoltage sources and current", 
    "sources and simply take the\nresistance measure at the", 
    "port, of course, without\nthe short.", 
    "I go ahead and measure the\nresistance seen at the port", 
    "with all the voltages and\ncurrents turned off.", 
    "OK?", 
    "That would be my Norton\nresistance, RN.", 
    "So again, we stated this\npattern, a current source IN", 
    "parallel to a Norton resistance\nRN, where this", 
    "corresponds to the Thevenin\nequivalent, where I have VTH", 
    "and RTH in series.", 
    "So the Norton is the dual\nof the Thevenin.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Where the Thevenin is the\nvoltage in series with the", 
    "resistance, and its dual is the\nNorton equivalent, which", 
    "is the current source in\nparallel with resistance.", 
    "An immediate question that comes\nto mind is how are the", 
    "Thevenin and Norton equivalents", 
    "related to each other?", 
    "After all, they are the\nduals of one another.", 
    "And so notice the Thevenin\nequivalent on the left-hand", 
    "side and the Norton equivalent\non the right-hand side.", 
    "The resistances RTH\nand the Norton", 
    "resistance RN are equal.", 
    "And then we can also relate the\nNorton current IN and the", 
    "Thevenin voltage as follows.", 
    "IN is VTH divided by RTH.", 
    "And so if you take the Thevenin\nvoltage and divide", 
    "that by the Thevenin resistance,\nyou get the Norton", 
    "current, IN.", 
    "So this very quickly shows you\nhow you can go from the Norton", 
    "to the Thevenin.", 
    "One question I am often asked is\nwhen do I use the Thevenin", 
    "method and when do I use\nthe Norton method?", 
    "Well, you know, that comes\nfrom experience.", 
    "Like you look at circuits in\none of our earlier examples", 
    "where the external network\ncontained a voltage source in", 
    "series with a resistance, it\nmade sense to take the rest of", 
    "the network and turn that into\nThevenin equivalent.", 
    "However, if I have a basic\ncircuit containing a current", 
    "source and a resistance in\nparallel, then it might be", 
    "easier to take my external\nnetwork and convert that into", 
    "a Norton equivalent.", 
    "So, really, when you want\nto get things in", 
    "parallel, think Norton.", 
    "When you want to get things in\nseries to simplify analysis,", 
    "think Thevenin.",
