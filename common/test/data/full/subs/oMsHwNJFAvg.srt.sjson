    "SPEAKER: All right.", 
    "Let me show you some more fun stuff regarding Q. Let me keep", 
    "you in suspense for a little longer.", 
    "And let's start by looking at a series RLC circuit in some", 
    "more detail.", 
    "So let me first write down--", 
    "this time around, let me look at Vr, the", 
    "voltage across the resistor.", 
    "In the previous video, we looked at the voltage across", 
    "the capacitor, Vc, and we showed that the response", 
    "across the capacitor could increase at unboundedly if Q", 
    "was very, very large.", 
    "And in this case, let's look at the voltage across R and", 
    "see what happens there and what happens to filters as I", 
    "change the parameters of the circuit.", 
    "So recall that Vr are over Vi is equal to the impedance of", 
    "the resistor, R, divided by the sum of the impedances, so", 
    "R plus j omega l plus 1 by j omega c.", 
    "OK, you know this.", 
    "So we can also plot the response at R. And we've done", 
    "this before.", 
    "I want to show you some more stuff today.", 
    "So I have omega here.", 
    "And let me plot Vr divided by Vi.", 
    "Take its magnitude.", 
    "Let us say 1 is here, So we saw for a filter like this, we", 
    "can quickly plot out the behavior as follows.", 
    "Notice that for very low frequencies, when omega 0 is", 
    "very, very low, for very low frequencies, what happens?", 
    "This part goes to 0, So therefore, the denominator", 
    "becomes very large, and so I have a very low response.", 
    "In other words, C blocks out low", 
    "frequencies, as we saw before.", 
    "And for high frequencies, the inductor blocks high", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "So I get something that looks like this for high", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "So for this circuit, I may get some sort of response that", 
    "looks like this.", 
    "I should draw that a little bit more clearly.", 
    "At omega 0--", 
    "let me just erase that and do it again.", 
    "And I'll tell you why.", 
    "Omega 0, Notice that if I write down omega equals omega", 
    "0, then at omega 0, it turns out that the response is 1.", 
    "You've done this before.", 
    "J omega 0 l plus 1 by J omega 0 C, you can verify for", 
    "yourself goes to 0 at omega 0.", 
    "So omega 0 is 1 by square root of LC.", 
    "Omega naught is square root of 1 by LC.", 
    "And I've bring the J up, I get a minus.", 
    "And you recall we did this table would cancel", 
    "out, giving me 1.", 
    "So at omega 0, this is going to be 1.", 
    "So a proper plot would look like this.", 
    "That's better.", 
    "OK So I get some frequency response that looks like that.", 
    "So what I'd like to do is look at something that we call", 
    "selectivity.", 
    "So selectivity, we saw this in the context of radios.", 
    "Selectivity has to do with how selective my filter is.", 
    "Recall this is a band pass filter And selectivity says,", 
    "how sharp is this band?", 
    "How selective am I?", 
    "So one way of figuring out selectivity is to", 
    "look at this ratio.", 
    "Selectivity.", 
    "So look at the ratio omega 0 by delta 0.", 
    "Where delta 0 is called the bandwidth, it's measured at", 
    "the point where the various parts of the curve reaches 1", 
    "by square root 2 of its highest value.", 
    "So let's say I have some point here, which is 1 by square", 
    "root 2, where this is 1, and this is 1 by square root 2.", 
    "So I marked it out.", 
    "So if you look at this point and this point here, then this", 
    "is what I call a delta omega.", 
    "I call that the bandwidth.", 
    "Bandwidth is the width of the band path's response.", 
    "It's the width of this curve measured at the 1 by square", 
    "root 2 point.", 
    "So is that clear?", 
    "So this delta omega here is the bandwidth.", 
    "And so let me write that down.", 
    "This is the resonant frequency, omega 0, divided by", 
    "the bandwidth.", 
    "And you should convince yourself that this ratio,", 
    "omega 0 by delta omega, is indicative of the selectivity.", 
    "So higher omega 0 by delta omega, higher the selectivity.", 
    "So the reason is that as delta omega becomes narrower, my", 
    "filter becomes more selective.", 
    "Let me choose a different color here.", 
    "So as an example, if I have a more selective filter, it", 
    "would look like this.", 
    "So for this one, a delta omega is smaller.", 
    "Omega 0 is the same.", 
    "They all peak at the same point.", 
    "And at the peak, they are, for this kind of a filter, the", 
    "magnitude of the transfer function V0 over VI is one.", 
    "So as my bandwidth decreases--", 
    "as my filter gets narrower--", 
    "it becomes more selective.", 
    "OK, as I said earlier, a measure of selectivity is", 
    "omega 0 by delta omega where delta omega is the bandwidth.", 
    "So if I drew another filter here, another response, that", 
    "this is even more--", 
    "this would be-- oh, that didn't change the color.", 
    "Let me try that again.", 
    "So this is even more selective.", 
    "So as I go lower, this one is more selective.", 
    "This one is more selective than either the", 
    "green or the red.", 
    "And the green is more selective", 
    "than the red function.", 
    "And the reason is that delta omega is smaller for each of", 
    "these, where delta omega is the bandwidth defined as", 
    "taking the points at which the magnitude of the transfer", 
    "function reaches 1 by square root 2 point and measuring the", 
    "difference between the two points, whether it reaches", 
    "that magnitude, 1 by square root 2.", 
    "OK, so let's take a look at this value here.", 
    "Let's take a look at omega 0 by delta omega.", 
    "And we've convinced ourselves so far that omega naught by", 
    "delta omega is indicative of selectivity.", 
    "Higher the ratio, more selective is the filter.", 
    "Clearly, blue, more selective, because", 
    "delta omega is smaller.", 
    "So let's try to figure out what is going on with this", 
    "selectivity and see what omega 0 by delta omega turns out to", 
    "be in terms of the circuit parameters LCR and so on."
