    "PROFESSOR: OK, to review very\nquickly, again remember, we", 
    "had set out to show that the\nsmall signal response to even", 
    "a nonlinear circuit was going\nto be linear when I made a", 
    "particular type of\nconstruction.", 
    "So let me go back and rewrite\nthe equation, and this is", 
    "very, very important.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to summarize\nthis again, just to", 
    "be absolutely clear.", 
    "So this is the x equation\nthat I had.", 
    "And in this equation, what I\nsaid was I could equate the DC", 
    "parts, and that gave me\nmy operating point.", 
    "And then I could go and equate\nthe time-varying parts.", 
    "And by doing so, here\nis what I got.", 
    "So I got a DC part.", 
    "And the DC part simply said ID\nequal to f of VD, and I said", 
    "this was my operating point.", 
    "And then I had a time-varying\npart.", 
    "Let me put that in red\njust for consistency.", 
    "So this was my time-varying\npart.", 
    "And here, my delta iD was equal\nto d of f of VD, dVD", 
    "evaluated at VD equals capital\nV capital D times delta VD.", 
    "So here, this part here\nwas constant with", 
    "respect to delta VD.", 
    "And so it is a constant times\ndelta VD, all right?", 
    "And I also said that this little\npiece here was the", 
    "slope at capital V capital D\ncomma capital I capital D. Let", 
    "me just do it here--", 
    "VD, ID.", 
    "OK, so that was the\nslope at VD, ID.", 
    "So that&#39;s what I showed\nyou so far, OK?", 
    "Now, I can just wrap it up and\nclose shop here and really", 
    "nail down why is the small\nsignal response linear and", 
    "just look at it much\nmore closely now.", 
    "The two equations that I&#39;ve\nwritten for you should pretty", 
    "clearly identify that.", 
    "If you notice in these two\nequations, I&#39;m going to write", 
    "down the second piece\nhere, delta ID.", 
    "If you notice in this equation,\ndelta ID equals some", 
    "constant times VD.", 
    "So in the operating point part,\nI had a DC value, ID", 
    "equals f of VD.", 
    "In the time-dependent part, I\nhad my delta ID equal to some", 
    "constant times delta VD.", 
    "So, not surprisingly, I&#39;ve shown\nyou that delta ID is", 
    "proportional to delta VD.", 
    "And that is what I set out to\nshow you, where I started to", 
    "show you that my small signal\nresponse was linear.", 
    "And ID was my small signal\nresponse, and I&#39;ve shown you", 
    "that it is proportional to the\nsmall signal input delta VD.", 
    "And there you have it.", 
    "So there it shows that my small", 
    "signal response is linear.", 
    "Recall some notation that we\nhave. And by the notation,", 
    "which said delta ID shall be\ndenoted as small i small v,", 
    "and the delta VD is going to be\ndenoted small v small d in", 
    "our circuits, OK?", 
    "So this just goes\nto show that the", 
    "incremental response is linear.", 
    "So incremental response\nis linear.", 
    "Now, the incremental response\nagain is ID, and by showing", 
    "that it is proportional to delta\nVD, I&#39;ve just shown you", 
    "that the incremental\nresponse is linear.", 
    "Let me wrap up by going back to\nan example and tying things", 
    "up and relating them to be\nspecific device that we have.", 
    "So let&#39;s go look\nat our example.", 
    "I&#39;ve written the x equation up\nhere, just for your reference.", 
    "So from x, I can directly go\nahead and write down the", 
    "values for my device.", 
    "So for my device, my\n[UNINTELLIGIBLE], remember ID", 
    "was some function of VD.", 
    "So this was some function of f\nof VD, and that function, you", 
    "recall, was ae is to bVD.", 
    "OK, that was the function.", 
    "ae raised to bVD was my\nnonlinear function", 
    "relationship between\nID and VD.", 
    "So I&#39;m just going to substitute\nthat function in", 
    "and show you what the\nincremental linear values are", 
    "for the specific device\nthat we had.", 
    "So from x, from x, I can write\nID plus small i, small d.", 
    "So remember, delta ID is denoted\nas small i, small d.", 
    "And that is more or less\nequal to the following.", 
    "What his f of VD?", 
    "So f of VD is simply the\nfunction evaluated at V", 
    "capital D. So it is simply\nae b raised to VD.", 
    "So that is f of VD.", 
    "And then plus, I get the\nsecond part here.", 
    "And the second part is the slope\nof that function about", 
    "the point capital V capital D.", 
    "So what is the derivative\nof this function", 
    "at the point bVD?", 
    "So the derivative is simply\ngiven by a, so", 
    "I get b down here.", 
    "And then I write e bVD, so\nthat&#39;s my slope, OK?", 
    "So ae raised to bVD times b is\nmy is my slope, and then I", 
    "multiplied that by small vd.", 
    "So that is my derivative of the\nfunction times delta VD.", 
    "Let me write that slightly\ndifferently for a reason I&#39;ll", 
    "show you in a second.", 
    "Let me write that down\nas ae raised to b", 
    "capital V capital D plus--", 
    "let me move b out here, so\nwrite this as ae b--", 
    "oh, you know what?", 
    "This should have been capital\nV capital D because I&#39;m", 
    "evaluating it at capital V\ncapital D. So ae b capital V", 
    "capital D times b small vd.", 
    "OK, so next, I can go and equate\nthe DC and incremental", 
    "terms, so let me write\nthat down.", 
    "Equate DC and incremental terms.\nSo if I equate the DC", 
    "and incremental terms, let&#39;s\nstart with the DC.", 
    "I get ID being equal to the DC\nterm, so ID is equal to ae", 
    "raised to b VD.", 
    "OK, that&#39;s my DC part.", 
    "And as I mentioned before, this\nwas my operating point.", 
    "I called this my operating\npoint.", 
    "This is also known\nas the DC offset.", 
    "This is also known as\nthe bias point.", 
    "So that point is called the DC\noffset, the bias point, or the", 
    "operating point.", 
    "Next, let me equate incremental\nterms. And so", 
    "here, my incremental term\nis this part here", 
    "and this part here.", 
    "So I get id is equal to ae\nraised to b capital V capital", 
    "D times b v small d.", 
    "There I&#39;ve equated my\nincremental terms.", 
    "So again, id is equal\nto the following.", 
    "Before I write that\ndown, notice", 
    "something interesting here.", 
    "So look at this blue term marked\nin blue here and the", 
    "term marked in blue here.", 
    "What do you see?", 
    "The terms marked in blue\nare simply ID.", 
    "Those are our constant values,\nand those terms marked in blue", 
    "are simply ID.", 
    "So back to my little signals\nhere, I can replace this with", 
    "ID times b times vd.", 
    "So this whole thing\nis a constant.", 
    "And then notice that this is my\nsmall signal response id.", 
    "So id is a small signal response\nto a small input vd,", 
    "and notice that is linear.", 
    "So I could say my small signal\nresponse is linear.", 
    "And the reason is that id\nis a constant times vd.", 
    "So because id and vd\nare proportional,", 
    "my response is linear.", 
    "And not surprisingly, I derived", 
    "that from Taylor series.", 
    "And here, I&#39;ve just simply\napplied that to the specific", 
    "circuit at hand.",
