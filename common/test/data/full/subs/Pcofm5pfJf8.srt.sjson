    "voltage-controlled\ncurrent source.", 
    "So this is a", 
    "voltage-controlled current source.", 
    "So as before, you have the\ncontrol port here.", 
    "And you have the output\nport here.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is in\nthis particular circuit, I&#39;m", 
    "going to connect a voltage\nsource at the input, an", 
    "independent voltage source\nat the input, VI.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to connect\nthe output as follows.", 
    "I&#39;m going to connect\na resistor to", 
    "the output as follows.", 
    "I&#39;m going to call it RL\nfor load resistor.", 
    "This terminal is going to\nbe connected to ground.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to connect\nthe RL terminal to a voltage", 
    "supply that I&#39;m going to call\nVS, voltage supply and then go", 
    "down to the ground as well.", 
    "So we&#39;re a little bit of a\ncircuit pattern going here.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to pick an\nexample for my current.", 
    "So in this case, I have\na current that I&#39;m", 
    "going to call iD.", 
    "And you will see why\nI call it iD later.", 
    "I should have called it\nIO in relation to VO.", 
    "But I&#39;m just going\nto call it iD.", 
    "So ID is the current of my", 
    "voltage-controlled current source.",

    "of the input voltage VIN, OK?",

    "It&#39;s a nonlinear relation.", 
    "It&#39;s iD equals K divided by 2\ntimes VIN minus 1 all squared.", 
    "And this is going to be\ntrue for VIN greater", 
    "than equal to 1 volt.", 
    "And iD is going to\nbe 0 otherwise.", 
    "OK, so this is a funky little\nvoltage-controlled current", 
    "source whose behavior is\ndescribed by the equations", 
    "shown here.", 
    "So the equations say that if VIN\nis less than 1 volt, then", 
    "the current is 0.",

    "this current source relates to\nthe voltage VIN K divided by 2",

    "function of VIN.", 
    "So find out V0 as a function\nof VIN for me for a circuit",

    "drawing this box, but really\nwhat I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m", 
    "simply going to eliminate that\nbox and clean up my circuit a",

    "So what I can do is draw my\ninput voltage, VI, here.", 
    "And one of the terminals\nis going to be", 
    "connected to ground.", 
    "And then what I&#39;m going to do is\nfor my current source, I&#39;m", 
    "not going to show you\nthe entire box.", 
    "One terminal will ground\nas before.", 
    "The other terminal went\nto my resistor.", 
    "And then I want to do a\nshorthand notation for the", 
    "power supply VS. You&#39;ve seen\nthat shorthand before.", 
    "So rather than drawing out the\nentire power supply, I&#39;m just", 
    "going to show you a shorthand\nnotation for it.", 
    "And this is RL.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to measure V0\nwith respect to ground.", 
    "And here it is.", 
    "So this is a shorthand notation\nfor the exact same", 
    "circuit that I showed\nyou earlier.", 
    "And this was my control port\nfor the dependent source.", 
    "And the current for the\ndependent source iD was", 
    "related to VIN minus 1 squared\nfor VIN greater than or equal", 
    "to minus 1 and equal\nto 0 otherwise.", 
    "It&#39;s the exact same as the\nprevious diagram, just that", 
    "I&#39;ve given you a little bit\nof a shorthand here.", 
    "OK, so now let me go ahead\nand solve this.", 
    "And not surprisingly, we are\ngoing to use the node method.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with the node\nmethod in order to solve this", 
    "circuit here.", 
    "So let&#39;s start by applying\nthe node method.", 
    "And let&#39;s write down the\nnode equation for", 
    "the node shown here.", 
    "So this is my node with the\nunknown node voltage.", 
    "So here&#39;s what I&#39;m\ngoing to do.", 
    "I am going to let you do this.", 
    "So you should go ahead and write\ndown the node equation", 
    "for this node and check\nit out for yourselves.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to show\nyou how to do it.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to wait a few\nseconds, pause for a few",
