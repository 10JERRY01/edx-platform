    "SPEAKER : OK.", 
    "Let's jump right to it.", 
    "What is really going on?", 
    "So this is node A, B, and this is node C.", 
    "So [? around ?]", 
    "the circuit that you've seen so far, my switch is closed,", 
    "and so the effective parallel resistance here is 50 ohms.", 
    "And notice that at this node, instead of seeing something", 
    "well-behaved like this, I am seeing something", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "Not what I expected.", 
    "What is going on here?", 
    "All right, so let's stare at the circuit for a few seconds.", 
    "What is really going on with the following?", 
    "If you look at the power supply here, isn't it", 
    "interesting where the issues--", 
    "maybe as far away, here--", 
    "completely unexpected.", 
    "So if I had to complete the circuit here, I have a power", 
    "supply here, plus, minus.", 
    "This is 5 volts.", 
    "And this goes all the way to ground here.", 
    "This is my ground.", 
    "So now let's look at what's going on.", 
    "So I was looking to have the power supply here charge up", 
    "the capacitor through the 50-ohm resistor right here.", 
    "And the return path for the current goes through this loop", 
    "here, and there we go.", 
    "So notice that there is a current loop here.", 
    "So starting from here through this resistor, through the", 
    "capacitor, through the return path here, and back in here, I", 
    "have a loop.", 
    "Remember, currents flow in loops.", 
    "I can't have currents flowing unless there is a loop.", 
    "Unless there's a return path for the current, we just have", 
    "a single wire.", 
    "Without a return path, there's going to be no current flow.", 
    "So I have a current flow here, and there is a loop.", 
    "And loops of wire like this have an inductance", 
    "associated with them.", 
    "So recall, in a lumped circuit abstraction, we said that the", 
    "flux outside our elements is going to be 0.", 
    "But here, because of this loop here and current flowing into", 
    "the loop, I am going to have some flux", 
    "associated with my loops.", 
    "And I have this inductance here.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this effective", 
    "inductance--", 
    "call it a parasitic inductance.", 
    "I am going to model the parasitic inductance of this", 
    "loop, and I am going to stick that inductance here.", 
    "So I've taken that inductance off this loop, and I've stuck", 
    "that inductance right here.", 
    "That's a parasitic inductance, and it is out there.", 
    "So this is a large loop.", 
    "So the parasitic inductance is here.", 
    "So let me just write that down for you so you have it for", 
    "your notes.", 
    "So I have included the parasitic inductance of these", 
    "sets of wires that connect together in a loop.", 
    "So now this parasitic inductance captures the", 
    "inductance of this big loop.", 
    "And I've gone back and my lumped circuit abstraction", 
    "still applies, because I've captured all of that stuff in", 
    "this little inductance, and I have stuck that in there.", 
    "So what does that do for us?", 
    "So let's go and take a look at what I've done.", 
    "So what I've done is, when the switch up here is closed, I", 
    "have a large loop of current.", 
    "I have a large loop here, and I have stuck the effective", 
    "inductance of that loop in here into the circuit, and I'm", 
    "going to model that as some inductance L.", 
    "So now let's look at that circuit.", 
    "So my circuit is going to contain a bunch", 
    "of components here.", 
    "So I have a voltage source, plus/minus ground, 5 volts.", 
    "So this is my plus/minus 5-volt source here.", 
    "So this is a two kilohms in parallel with 50 ohms here.", 
    "So that's my resistance here.", 
    "So it's in series with that resistance.", 
    "And then from there, I have a connection going to inductance", 
    "L. So that's my connection to inductance L. And then it goes", 
    "to my capacitance, CGS.", 
    "There's my capacitance, CGS, and then I get my", 
    "return path to ground.", 
    "So there is my effective circuit.", 
    "So this is my node B, and that node is where the second", 
    "MOSFET is connected.", 
    "So this is a second-order system.", 
    "In this second-order system, I have two energy storage", 
    "components.", 
    "I have a capacitor and I have an inductor.", 
    "There's two energy storage elements.", 
    "This is a second-order circuit.", 
    "So clearly, our first-order dynamics that expected us to", 
    "see a nicely rising waveform characterized by exponentials", 
    "may not apply because this is a second-order circuit, and so", 
    "far I have not given you the tools to understand", 
    "second-order circuits.", 
    "So in the next couple of sequences, we're going to look", 
    "at the dynamics of these second-order circuits and see", 
    "if that can help us explain this funky little waveform", 
    "that we saw as a function of time.", 
    "So let's spend some time and understand the dynamics of", 
    "this little circuit, understand how a voltage", 
    "across the capacitor, for instance, will behave when I", 
    "have a second-order circuit.", 
    "And see if, using some theory, we can explain why it was that", 
    "we got this funny little behavior, and use the same", 
    "theory to understand what the magnitude of that waveform", 
    "was, and if you can exactly predict what is going on here."
