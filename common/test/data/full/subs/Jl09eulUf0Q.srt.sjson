    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "So the other possible\ncombinations for the inputs", 
    "are, I&#39;ve done 0, 0; 0 1,\nI can get a 1, 0, and I", 
    "can get a 1, 1.", 
    "The inputs are a 1, 0, the\noutput is still a 0, and", 
    "finally, if my inputs x and y\nare each 1, then my output z", 
    "is going to be a 1.", 
    "So really, in a truth table\nrepresentation, enumerate all", 
    "input combinations.", 
    "And for each input combination,\nI write down what", 
    "the output is going\nto look like.", 
    "And that is a truth table.", 
    "I can also do wave forms. So\nrecall, this is my AND gate,", 
    "with two inputs, x and y, where\nx and y are both digital", 
    "signals, output is a z, and z\nis a digital signal, too.", 
    "So let me apply some inputs to\nthese gates, and I can look at", 
    "what wave forms look like.", 
    "So in this case, here are\nmy two input signals.", 
    "So x is a low-high-low-high\nsignal.", 
    "So as an example, this could be\n0 volts and this could be 5", 
    "volts in [? one of ?]\nmy conventions, and", 
    "this is my time axis.", 
    "So this is 0 followed by\n1, 0 followed by 1.", 
    "And my y signal is\nsomewhat similar.", 
    "It also goes from 0 to 5\nvolts, according to the", 
    "convention.", 
    "And 0, high, 0, and then it\ngoes high for a long time.", 
    "My question to you is, what\nis z going to look like?", 
    "So we can do the analysis\nas follows.", 
    "So for this signal, notice that\nat any given time, first", 
    "of all, x and y just take on\ntwo values, 0 or 5 volts.", 
    "So those are the digital\nsignals.", 
    "And when they transition from 0\nto 5, or 5 to 0, they do so", 
    "very quickly.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at what\nz should look like.", 
    "So let&#39;s see.", 
    "In this region, both x and y are\n0, so z is going to be 0.", 
    "Then in this region here, y is a\n1, but x is still 0, so z is", 
    "still going to be 0.", 
    "Then in this region here, notice\nthat y is 0 and so is", 
    "x, so z is going to be a 1.", 
    "And then at this point, x stays\nat 0, but y goes down to", 
    "0, so z is going\nto become a 0.", 
    "And then z becomes a 0 until\nthe next transition here.", 
    "But even in this transition,\nnotice that x is still a 0, so", 
    "z is going to stay a 0 until\nthey both become 1.", 
    "So z will be a 0, and then y\nbecomes a 1, and so does x,", 
    "and so z will become\na 1 at this point.", 
    "And then because both y\nand x are 1&#39;s, z will", 
    "continue to be 1.", 
    "So notice, we can do an analysis\nwhere the signals are", 
    "changing with time.", 
    "And at any given point in time,\nyou can draw a line", 
    "through the signals, and simply\nlook at what the values", 
    "of each of the signals are.", 
    "So in this case, x is 1, y\nis 1, so z should be 1.", 
    "In this particular situation\nhere, I can look at this", 
    "timeline, and I see\nx is 0, y is 1, so", 
    "therefore z must be a 0.", 
    "So on and so forth.", 
    "So in our digital world, we have\nthese little processing", 
    "devices called gates.", 
    "So I just showed you the AND\ngate above with two inputs x", 
    "and y, and the output\nbeing a z.", 
    "So this is the next level\nof abstraction.", 
    "So notice that over here, we\nhad resistors and volted", 
    "sources and so on.", 
    "By the way, I haven&#39;t shown you\nhow to build this gate,", 
    "but supposing that an abstract\ngate of the sort, and to that", 
    "gate I applied 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s, then\nmy output would behave in", 
    "the same manner as\na digital gate.", 
    "So this is my next abstract\ndevice, and this leads me to", 
    "the combinational gate\nabstraction.", 
    "Because these are abstract\ndevices where I don&#39;t really", 
    "have to know what&#39;s\ninside them.", 
    "If they have been built right,\nthen I can just tell you what", 
    "the output is going to look like\nbased on what the inputs", 
    "are, and the implementation on\nthe inside will make it all", 
    "work out to be correct.", 
    "But as a designer, I just have\nto deal with the abstract", 
    "interfaces.", 
    "So the combinational gate\nabstraction says this.", 
    "A combinational gate adheres\nto the static discipline.", 
    "That&#39;s the first thing.", 
    "In other words, it must meet\nthe voltage thresholds.", 
    "So the input signals x and y,\nfor instance, satisfy the", 
    "input thresholds vih and vil,\nthen the gate must guarantee", 
    "that the output will satisfy\nthe output threshold.", 
    "So if the vih and vil are\nsatisfied, then the output", 
    "must satisfy voh and\nvol thresholds.", 
    "And by doing so, it will\nadhere to the static", 
    "discipline.", 
    "The second thing a gate is that\nits output are a function", 
    "of inputs and outputs.", 
    "So at any given point in time,\nyou can determine its output", 
    "by instantaneously looking\nat what its inputs are.", 
    "So in other words, you can\nfigure out the output for a", 
    "gate simply by looking\nat the inputs at", 
    "that instant in time.", 
    "What happened in the past or\nwhat happens in the future is", 
    "completely irrelevant.", 
    "The output is simply a function\nof the inputs alone.", 
    "And so the beauty of such\nan abstraction is", 
    "that you can be relaxed.", 
    "Digital logic designers do not\nhave to care about what is", 
    "inside a gate.", 
    "If I build a gate which\nadheres to the static", 
    "discipline but the outputs are\na function of inputs alone,", 
    "they satisfy the combinational\ngate abstraction, and by doing", 
    "so, as the designer, I don&#39;t\nhave to care about what is", 
    "inside the gate.", 
    "I can simply go ahead and design\nwith these abstract", 
    "components called gates that\nprocess these digital signals", 
    "in a given manner.", 
    "And in this example, for the AND\ngate, I showed you a truth", 
    "table, or you can use\na Boolean equation.", 
    "In this case, it is z equals\nx dot y, that reflects the", 
    "behavior of the gate.", 
    "In the next video, we&#39;ll\nlook at a bunch", 
    "of additional gates.", 
    "But fundamentally, the main idea\nhere is, you don&#39;t have", 
    "to care about what&#39;s\ninside the gate.", 
    "The gate will behave according\nto its abstract properties.",
