    "SPEAKER 1: Now let's study the fun energy", 
    "storage property of inductors.", 
    "And I'll start by drawing the inductor symbol with the", 
    "inductance, L. And the first relation that we looked at was", 
    "lambda equals Li.", 
    "And we just saw that, for the inductor, V is L di/dt.", 
    "Oh, let me make that clearer.", 
    "OK, there you go.", 
    "So as I said earlier, inductors and capacitors do", 
    "not dissipate energy.", 
    "OK, let's write that down, just to be absolutely clear.", 
    "So you can pump energy into them, and they will absorb it", 
    "and store it.", 
    "Or if they have stored energy, they can supply this energy.", 
    "OK, so let's figure out what is the energy that you can", 
    "store within an inductor for a given current that you're", 
    "pumping through the inductor.", 
    "So power, as always, is given by Vi.", 
    "And what I can do in this case is notice that V", 
    "is given by L di/dt.", 
    "So I can simply write that down as i times L di/dt.", 
    "And then what I can do is I could move the i inside and", 
    "change expression to reflect that.", 
    "So I can say d by dt of i squared divided by 2.", 
    "And then, since l itself is independent of time, I can", 
    "move l inside, OK?", 
    "So that is given by d of dt by li squared divided by 2.", 
    "OK, so don't forget that power is the rate of change of", 
    "energy within an element.", 
    "And so, therefore, the energy that can be stored in an", 
    "inductor at any given time can be given by", 
    "1/2 times li squared.", 
    "OK, and again, why is that?", 
    "So instantaneously, the power there that has been pumped", 
    "into an inductor is Vi, OK?", 
    "Remember, by our associated variables discipline, by", 
    "choosing the current direction to be into the positive", 
    "terminal, Vi reflects the power into the device because", 
    "of the power being pumped into the inductor at any given", 
    "point and instant in time is given by d by dt of li squared", 
    "divided by 2, OK?", 
    "So the rate of change of whatever this is, is the", 
    "instantaneous power being pumped into it, OK?", 
    "And so, therefore, that quantity is the energy because", 
    "the rate of change of energy is given by power.", 
    "So energy itself is half li squared for the inductor.", 
    "Now I can also show you the corresponding value that we", 
    "have for a capacitor, just for your reference.", 
    "And let me switch to green.", 
    "OK, so switching to green, recall, for the capacitor, the", 
    "energy for the capacitor was half CV squared, OK?", 
    "So what this says is that, if the voltage across a capacitor", 
    "is V, then half CV squared is the energy", 
    "stored in the capacitor.", 
    "Similarly, for an inductor, if the current through the", 
    "inductor is I, then the energy stored within the inductor is", 
    "half li squared.", 
    "OK, in the capacitor, the charge on the capacitor and in", 
    "the inductor have magnetic flux, OK?", 
    "And the energy is stored in the magnetic", 
    "field in the inductor.", 
    "And it is stored in the electric field in the", 
    "capacitor, OK?", 
    "So again, notice the dual relationship between the", 
    "inductor and capacitor by looking at these two", 
    "expressions.", 
    "So again, to quickly wrap up this little energy piece here,", 
    "so an inductor stores energy.", 
    "It is also a memory device, OK?", 
    "History matters.", 
    "And we'll see more about this later and really understand", 
    "more deeply why we say that history matters, OK?", 
    "But basically, it stores energy.", 
    "And that captures what must have happened to the inductor", 
    "in the past."
