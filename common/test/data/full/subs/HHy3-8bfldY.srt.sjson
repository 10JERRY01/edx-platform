    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "So we try to observe\na pattern here.", 
    "And this is something we\ndo a lot in 6.002.", 
    "We look for patterns.", 
    "So in this pattern, notice\nthat I have two voltage", 
    "sources, and so it appears that\nI might be able to apply", 
    "the superposition method.", 
    "Also notice that the circuit\nis a linear, so the", 
    "superposition method applies.", 
    "So let me go ahead and apply\nthe superposition method.", 
    "So by the superposition\nmethod--", 
    "since you are much more\nexperienced, I am not going to", 
    "go and physically draw out two\nsubcircuits starting off the", 
    "sources and so on.", 
    "But apply the superposition\nmethod, pretty much drawing", 
    "the circuits in your mind.", 
    "So remember that there are\ntwo voltage sources.", 
    "So somehow I have to sum two\ncomponents related to the two", 
    "subvoltages, V1 and V2.", 
    "So what is the component\ndue to V1 alone?", 
    "So the component due to V1 alone\nwould be one where I", 
    "would shut off V2.", 
    "And when I shut off V2, V2\nwould be short-circuited.", 
    "So if this note is\nshort-circuited, then notice", 
    "that V1 here would simply appear\nthrough a resistant", 
    "divider, through resistances\nR1 and R2, to ground.", 
    "So therefore, V0 is simply\nthe voltage across the R2", 
    "resistance, and that is what\nI will write here.", 
    "So that is simply R2 divided\nby R1 plus R2 times V1.", 
    "That is a component to V0,\nbecause of V1 alone.", 
    "Now let me go with V2 alone.", 
    "In this case, I&#39;m going\nto shut off V1.", 
    "And by short-circuiting V1,\nnotice that V2 now appears", 
    "across R2 and R1, and V0 itself\nis the voltage across", 
    "R1 in this case.", 
    "It&#39;s the voltage between\nthe node with", 
    "voltage V0 and ground.", 
    "And there&#39;s a resistance\nR1 at that point.", 
    "So it is simply R1 divided\nby R1 plus R2 times V2.", 
    "So by superposition, V0 is now\nsimply a sum of two components", 
    "that relate to V1 and V2.", 
    "Also, for simplicity, supposing\nR1 were equal to R2.", 
    "Notice that V0 would simply\nbe given by V1 plus", 
    "V2 divided by 2.", 
    "So if R1 and R2 were equal, then\nnotice that V0 is simply", 
    "the average of the above two\nvoltages, V1 and V2.", 
    "So notice that in this case the\ncircuit is a very simple", 
    "adder circuit.", 
    "I&#39;m also doing the scaling,\ndividing by a factor of 2.", 
    "But this is a very simple\nadder circuit.", 
    "So this is an analog\nsignal-processing circuit, and", 
    "it seems to add up the two\nsignals, V1 and V2.", 
    "So where&#39;s the problem here?\nit seems to do my job.", 
    "I wanted to add up the two\nvoltages somehow, and this", 
    "circuit is doing it for me.", 
    "So what is the problem?", 
    "So let&#39;s try to understand a\ngiven scenario here, and see", 
    "what a problem might be.", 
    "So I have same circuit again.", 
    "Nothing&#39;s changed.", 
    "And as before, V0 is measured\nwith respect", 
    "to the ground node.", 
    "So let&#39;s say, as an example,\nthat the input voltage V1 is", 
    "some sinusoid like I&#39;ve\nshown you here.", 
    "And assume that V2\nis some other DC", 
    "voltage, just for fun.", 
    "And so when you add up the two\nvoltages and divide by 2, you", 
    "will something that\nlooks like this.", 
    "You will see a waveform, a\nsinusoid, which is shifted up", 
    "a little bit because\nof the DC offset.", 
    "OK, so far, so good.", 
    "Everything seems to be working\nlike I planned.", 
    "Now let&#39;s have some fun.", 
    "Now suppose I wanted\nto transmit V0", 
    "to some other circuit.", 
    "So let&#39;s say, for example, I\nhad some other circuit out", 
    "here and I wanted to take the\nvoltage V0 and apply it to", 
    "this circuit.", 
    "So I would have to use a long\nwire and connect the wire to", 
    "that circuit.", 
    "Of course, remember, whenever\nyou connect one subcircuit to", 
    "another, you just can&#39;t\ntake one wire.", 
    "You also have to go and connect\nthe ground node.", 
    "You have to have\na return path.", 
    "So if there&#39;s any current\nflowing this way, you will", 
    "need a return path\nfor the current.", 
    "So in this case, let&#39;s say I\nwant to transmit the voltage", 
    "V0 to some circuit somewhere far\naway, and to do so, I have", 
    "to use a relatively long wire.", 
    "So I still don&#39;t see the\nproblem, and so as I said", 
    "before, there&#39;s a ground node\nhere as well that I would have", 
    "to connect to this other\nlittle system here.", 
    "Now if the world were perfect,\neven though I have a long wire", 
    "and all my circuit abstractions\nwork, I would get", 
    "exactly the same voltage\nwaveform", 
    "here that I saw earlier.", 
    "So this looks pretty\ngood as well.", 
    "I have the same voltage here,\nV0, and that is identical to", 
    "the one I had with\nthe short wire.", 
    "I still don&#39;t see the problem.", 
    "So now let&#39;s have some fun.", 
    "Let&#39;s see how the real world\ncan throw a monkey", 
    "wrench into the works.", 
    "What I&#39;m going to do now--", 
    "I have a long wire going\nthrough here.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to add some\nnoise on this wire.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to apply some noise\nvoltage to the wire.", 
    "Let me reflect that in\nthe following way.", 
    "So there&#39;s a small voltage\nsignal that I apply.", 
    "It&#39;s a noise signal.", 
    "The wire transmits the voltage\nto another location.", 
    "I&#39;m going to add this noise\nsignal onto it.", 
    "So what happens at the\npoint where you get", 
    "the received signal?", 
    "So there, instead of seeing this\nnice little signal, I am", 
    "now going to see a mass.", 
    "I am going to see something like\nthis because of the noise", 
    "signal that&#39;s been superimposed\non it.", 
    "And because of that, the\nreceiver has absolutely no", 
    "idea what&#39;s going on.", 
    "The receiver at the end of the\nlong wire will see this funny,", 
    "noisy signal and the receiver\ndoesn&#39;t know", 
    "what to do with it.", 
    "So this is the problem with\nanalog signal processing, is", 
    "that it tends to not have\ngreat immunity to noise.", 
    "It lacks noise immunity.", 
    "So analog signal processing\nlacks noise immunity, and", 
    "noise will simply add on to the\nsignal, and it&#39;s really", 
    "hard to figure out\nwhat&#39;s going on.", 
    "So in particular, what that will\ndo is if I add noise, and", 
    "if I&#39;m trying to distinguish\nbetween small signal values--", 
    "OK, so if I have a bunch of\nnoise here, but I&#39;m trying to", 
    "distinguish between signal\nvalues that are yea big, then", 
    "because of this noise, I am\nnot going to be able to", 
    "distinguish between small\nvalues, because the noise is", 
    "bigger and has overwhelmed\nthe signal.", 
    "So what do I do?", 
    "Looks like I am stuck.", 
    "So the idea is the following.", 
    "I am going to discretize\nvalues.", 
    "Think of it as lumping values.", 
    "I am going to restrict values to\nbe just one of two, and my", 
    "values are going to be\neither high or low.", 
    "My whole system is going\nto have two values.", 
    "Imagine a whole language where\nI have only two values.", 
    "Call it whatever you want.", 
    "High and low.", 
    "In terms of voltages,\nI may assign 5 volts", 
    "and 0 volts to that.", 
    "In the modern world, in modern\ndigital systems, I commonly", 
    "assign on the order of 1 volt\nand 0 volts, for a variety of", 
    "reasons, to high and low in\nsystems like iPhones and", 
    "cellphones and laptops\nand things like that.", 
    "And later on in the course,\nwe&#39;ll understand much better", 
    "why we apply only 0.7 volts or\n1 volt for a high, as opposed", 
    "to five volts.", 
    "But be that as it may for now--\nit could be high/low, it", 
    "could be 5 volts and 0 volts.", 
    "I could call it true\nand false.", 
    "Or I could call it 1 and 0.", 
    "There&#39;s two values.", 
    "I&#39;m going to call\nthem 1 and 0.", 
    "And sometimes, to distinguish\nbetween these logical values,", 
    "I may often represent them in\nquotes, to show that they are", 
    "a pair of symbols, 1 and 0.", 
    "So in terms of your numbering\nsystem, think of these like", 
    "two digits, 0 and 1.", 
    "So this is the idea.", 
    "Now, I still haven&#39;t come close\nto showing you how this", 
    "discretization is useful.", 
    "It doesn&#39;t solve the\nproblem of noise.", 
    "And let&#39;s take a look at how\nthis might be useful to us.", 
    "So far I&#39;ve just shown you that\nI can focus my efforts on", 
    "just two values, a 0 and\n1 or a high and low.", 
    "But now let&#39;s look at how\nthis might be useful.", 
    "Why is this discretization\nuseful?", 
    "Clearly it has to do something\nfor us in terms of noise.", 
    "So let me construct\na little system.", 
    "And in this system, I have a\nsender that wants to send some", 
    "values and I have a receiver\nthat needs to receive that", 
    "value from the sender.", 
    "So in order to do that, what I\nwill do is the sender will", 
    "send some value, and I will\nconnect the sender and", 
    "receiver with a wire.", 
    "Notice I always need a return\npath for the current.", 
    "And so I&#39;m going to connect\na second wire from", 
    "the sender to receiver.", 
    "But again, according to our\nnode method, I&#39;ll take my", 
    "shortcut and simply show\nthat both of them are", 
    "connected to ground.", 
    "And ground nodes are all\nconnected to each other", 
    "implicitly, just that in my\ndrawing this is a shorthand", 
    "notation that lets me avoid the\nhassle of drawing out the", 
    "ground node everywhere.", 
    "So this notation simply\ntells you that the", 
    "ground nodes are connected.", 
    "So let&#39;s say that the\nsender sends us some", 
    "voltage Vs, for Vsender.", 
    "And the receiver receives\nthe voltage of VR.", 
    "So for example, the sender\nsends a 5-volt value.", 
    "Then ideally the receiver\nwould have", 
    "received a 5-volt value.", 
    "Let&#39;s say, as an example, that\nmy sender wants to send a", 
    "sequence of signals\nto the receiver.", 
    "So in this case,\nhere&#39;s my axis.", 
    "Here&#39;s time flowing\nto the right.", 
    "In the y-axis, on the Vs axis,\ndown here is 0 volts.", 
    "Down here is 2.5 volts.", 
    "And up here is 5-volt signals.", 
    "So my sender sends this signal,\na 0-1-0 signal.", 
    "So it sends a 0 for some time,\na 1 for some time, and then a", 
    "0 or some time.", 
    "And it does so by sending 0\nvolts, and then sends 5 volts,", 
    "and then it sends\n0 volts again.", 
    "So the construction I use is\nthat any signal above 2.5", 
    "volts I am going to interpret\nas my logical high.", 
    "And any signal below 2.50 volts\nI am going to view as a", 
    "logical low.", 
    "So I&#39;m just going to\nhave a convention.", 
    "So the sender and the receiver\nare going to have a", 
    "convention, and the convention\nis that they will interpret", 
    "anything that is above a 2.5 as\na high, and anything that", 
    "is below 2.5 as a low.", 
    "So if I send a 0 and then a 5\nvolts and then a 0 volts, it", 
    "implies that my sender is trying\nto tell the receiver,", 
    "hey, look, I sent you\na 0 followed by a 1", 
    "followed by a 0.", 
    "By the way, understand that\ncommunication systems in the", 
    "real world are a lot more\ncomplex, but for now let&#39;s", 
    "keep it really, really simple to\nget the main point across.", 
    "So the receiver would receive\nsomething like this in an", 
    "ideal scenario.", 
    "There&#39;s no noise in the system,\neverything is ideal,", 
    "things go according to plan.", 
    "And so the receiver\nat VR will receive", 
    "the exact same signal--", 
    "0 volts, 5 volts, and 0 volts.", 
    "And so the receiver says, aha,\nthis is 0-1-0, and the", 
    "receiver is very happy.", 
    "What the sender has sent is\n0-1-0, and the receiver", 
    "receives a 0-1-0 because they\nfollow the same convention", 
    "that anything above 2.5 volts is\na 1 and anything below 2.5", 
    "volts is a logical 0.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So things seem to\nwork out well.", 
    "So far I have not introduced\nnoise into my system.",
