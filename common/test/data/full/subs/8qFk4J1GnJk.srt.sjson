    "SPEAKER 1: Let's get right down to solving this second", 
    "order differential equation.", 
    "Notice that I have divided throughout by [? LC ?]", 
    "to get this equation in this more convenient,", 
    "more economic form.", 
    "So what we're going to solve differential equations in", 
    "[? 6.002x ?]", 
    "in exactly one way, OK?", 
    "We use the [? discipline ?]", 
    "process throughout [? 6.002x ?].", 
    "If there's three or four or five different ways of doing", 
    "things, we try to stick to one canonical method.", 
    "OK, we may show you other methods, but try to stick to", 
    "one standard method so you always know what to use.", 
    "So when we solve circuits, we use the node method.", 
    "When we solve differential equations of the kind that we", 
    "see in 6.002x, which are constant coefficient, linear,", 
    "ordinary differential equations.", 
    "So for these kinds of equations, so we can solve", 
    "them using the standard method, the method of", 
    "homogeneous and particular solutions.", 
    "Let me write that down.", 
    "This method has the following steps, three steps.", 
    "The first step is to find the particular solution, vp.", 
    "We will call this solution vp.", 
    "The second step is to find the homogeneous solution.", 
    "And, as you recall from our solution of the LC circuit,", 
    "the solution to the homogeneous equation will", 
    "result in vH.", 
    "And we will do this in a four-step process.", 
    "So step two of the solution involves finding the", 
    "homogeneous solution, which itself has four steps.", 
    "The third step of the solution is to find the total solution", 
    "as the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions.", 
    "Let's go write that down too.", 
    "OK, its total solution is the sum of the particular and", 
    "homogeneous solutions.", 
    "And if my total solution is v, so that would be vp of t plus", 
    "homogeneous vH of t.", 
    "Of course, there will be a couple of constants that you", 
    "would not have found out through this process.", 
    "And what we'll do is we will use the initial conditions to", 
    "solve for the remaining constants.", 
    "All right, so there is our process.", 
    "Particular solution, homogeneous solution, and sum", 
    "them up to get the total solution.", 
    "Then go ahead and use initial conditions to solve for the", 
    "remaining constants.", 
    "All right?", 
    "So let's dive in and try to solve our", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "So let's pick an input.", 
    "And so why don't we go ahead and say, let's solve this for", 
    "this input.", 
    "So we'll use a step input at vI, where the input will step.", 
    "Let me switch to a different color for fun.", 
    "Input will step from 0 to capital vI at", 
    "time t equal to 0.", 
    "OK, so this is for input.", 
    "And this input can be expressed as vI, u of t.", 
    "The u of t is my unit step.", 
    "Let's pick the following initial conditions.", 
    "Let's go ahead and solve it for the ZSR, OK, the zero", 
    "state response for this input.", 
    "OK, so initial conditions will be these.", 
    "Since it's a ZSR, v at time t equal to 0 would be 0.", 
    "And similarly, i at time t will also be equal to 0, OK?", 
    "So that's the set up here.", 
    "This is my second order differential equation.", 
    "It's a linear, constant coefficient, ordinary", 
    "differential equation, OK?", 
    "Or ODE.", 
    "OK, the constant coefficient's here.", 
    "And that's a linear, ordinary differential equations.", 
    "And I'm going to use the method of homogeneous and", 
    "particular solutions to go ahead and solve it.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's start by finding out the particular solution."
