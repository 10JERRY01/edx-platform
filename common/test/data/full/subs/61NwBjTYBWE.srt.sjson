    "SPEAKER 1: Finally, let's look at, well, what else but the", 
    "quality factor again from a slightly different", 
    "perspective.", 
    "OK, one more perspective.", 
    "I should say yet another way of looking at Q. I would like", 
    "to punch you to page 819 of the textbook, which provides a", 
    "nice little summary of all of these ways of", 
    "looking at Q. All right.", 
    "So another way of looking at Q is the following, OK, where in", 
    "terms of energy.", 
    "So Q can also be defined as 2 pi times the energy stored in", 
    "the circuit divided by energy lost per cycle in the circuit.", 
    "Energy stored in the circuit.", 
    "And in this case, we have a inductor and capacitor in L", 
    "and C. Both of them store energy.", 
    "And divided by the energy lost per cycle.", 
    "OK, so at any given point in time, there will be some", 
    "energy stored in the circuit, in the L and the C. And in", 
    "that cycle, there will be some energy that is being lost by", 
    "the resistor in the circuit as well.", 
    "OK, you take the ratio of the energy stored and the energy", 
    "lost per cycle.", 
    "You come up with the constant, Q, again.", 
    "OK, so I won't dwell on this.", 
    "This is mostly for cultural interest. So I'll go ahead and", 
    "write down the expressions for you.", 
    "And you could look up page 819 in the textbook to get some", 
    "more details.", 
    "OK, 819 and the vicinity of that section.", 
    "So you could show that the energy stored in both the", 
    "inductor and capacitor in terms of the current is given", 
    "by half L times the magnitude of the current amplitude, half", 
    "LIR squared.", 
    "Again, remember, this is the sum.", 
    "It's not just the energy in one.", 
    "It's a sum of the energy in the inductor and capacitor,", 
    "OK, which is half L times IR squared.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So IR is the complex amplitude of the current.", 
    "So let me just draw that to be clear.", 
    "Oops.", 
    "So this is L. This is C. This is R. And I have some current,", 
    "IR, flowing through my circuit.", 
    "OK, this is--", 
    "let me just clean up the circuit here a little bit.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "Oops.", 
    "What's that?", 
    "OK.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Let me draw out--", 
    "there we go.", 
    "So IR is the current to the circuit.", 
    "And in terms of the current, half L times the magnitude of", 
    "the complex amplitude of the current squared is the energy", 
    "stored in the inductor and capacitor.", 
    "And the energy being dissipated is given by half IR", 
    "squared, OK?", 
    "So you recall from one of the exercises you did early on in", 
    "this course, if IR is the complex amplitude, if IR is", 
    "the amplitude of the sinusoid across R, then the power", 
    "dissipated is going to be half IR r squared--", 
    "I'm sorry, half I squared R. And then this is per cycle, so", 
    "I multiply that by 2 pi by omega not.", 
    "OK, and if you notice, what do you get?", 
    "All right, so IR squared and IR squared cancel out.", 
    "Half and half cancel out.", 
    "2 pi and 2 pi cancel out.", 
    "So what am I left with?", 
    "Omega not L over R. OK, and lo and behold, that is omega not", 
    "by 2 alpha, which is Q again.", 
    "OK, again and again.", 
    "OK, so I can view Q as 2 pi times the ratio of the energy", 
    "stowed in the inductor and capacitor divided by the", 
    "energy lost per cycle in the resistor.", 
    "OK, remember, the energy is lost only in the resistor.", 
    "The capacitor and inductor simply slosh the", 
    "energy back and forth.", 
    "OK, that gives you an indication of Q in general.", 
    "If you have to figure out the power delivered to or supplied", 
    "by various sources or inductors and capacitors and", 
    "so on, or complex impedances, you have to be very careful", 
    "because power is a non-linear computation.", 
    "And a lot of what we've done with the impedance model is", 
    "for linear circuits.", 
    "So you have to be very careful when you do it.", 
    "OK, so we don't dwell too much on that in this course.", 
    "You will see that in later courses."
