    "SPEAKER 1: So let&#39;s go back\nto the next element.", 
    "So the next one is\nvery simple.", 
    "For the next element, let&#39;s go\nwith a input source containing", 
    "both a DC term and a\ntime varying term.", 
    "And this one is pretty simple.", 
    "The large signal model for\nthis is simply the large", 
    "signal part of the source, VI.", 
    "And the small signal part of the\nsource is simply the small", 
    "signal part of the source.", 
    "So the small signal part of the\nsource is simply related", 
    "to the small signal input vi of\nt, while the large signal", 
    "is related to the DC value.", 
    "So that is pretty\nstraightforward.", 
    "Next, let&#39;s go a resistance.", 
    "Well we should be able to\nlinearize a linear element.", 
    "A resistor is a linear element\nbecause that satisfies both", 
    "the homogeneous property and\nthe superposition property.", 
    "You saw this from sequence\nthree, the first sequence of", 
    "the second week of the course.", 
    "And so for these linear\nresistors, they satisfy both", 
    "the homogeneous property and\nthe superposition property.", 
    "But we can still\nlinearize them.", 
    "It never hurts to linearize\na linear element.", 
    "And so for a resistor, notice\nthat I can build a large", 
    "signal model for the resistor,\nwhich is simply", 
    "the resistor itself.", 
    "And VR equals RIR is the\nequation that relates the", 
    "current to the voltage.", 
    "And I can do the same thing for\nthe small signal model.", 
    "And for the resistor, how does a\nsmall change in VR relate to", 
    "a small change in IR?", 
    "So if I change VR by a small\namount, how will IR change?", 
    "Well it&#39;s a resistor and it&#39;s\nlinear, so it&#39;s going to", 
    "behave like a resistor itself\nof the same value.", 
    "So I get an ir here and\nI get a vr here.", 
    "And vr is equal to Rir.", 
    "So that is the straightforward\nrelationship between the", 
    "voltage and the current,\nthe small signal", 
    "v and i for a resistor.", 
    "I can also do it analytically\nas we discussed earlier.", 
    "So vr would be given by del\nof RiR over del iR for iR", 
    "evaluated at capital IR\nand times small ir.", 
    "So in this case, del by del iR\nof RiR is simply R. So there", 
    "you have it.", 
    "So not surprisingly, these\ntwo are the same.", 
    "So for a resistor, its\nlinearized model is the", 
    "resistor itself.", 
    "OK finally, let&#39;s go do the\nmodel for a nonlinear device", 
    "D. We&#39;ve done this before,\nbut I&#39;ll do it again.", 
    "This is our expoDweep\nhypothetical device with the", 
    "I-V relation given by iD equals\nae raised to bVD.", 
    "So it&#39;s a large signal model.", 
    "Not surprisingly the nonlinear\ndevice model for the device", 
    "with the operating point values\nreplacing the V-I", 
    "element values.", 
    "So I have VD and ID.", 
    "And this is my usual nonlinear\nrelationship.", 
    "That is for the nonlinear\ndevice.", 
    "What about the small\nsignal model?", 
    "Well, as I told you earlier,\nfor devices like this, I&#39;m", 
    "going to end up with a resistor\nof some value R. And", 
    "there&#39;s going to be a small\nir and a small vd", 
    "characterizing it.", 
    "And I need to find out how does\nthe small id relate to", 
    "the small vd.", 
    "And as I said earlier, for small\nincremental changes,", 
    "these nonlinear elements behave\nlike linear resistors.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and apply\nthe methodology", 
    "we discussed earlier.", 
    "So in this case, id is some\nfunction of vD where the", 
    "function was given by\nae raised to bVD.", 
    "So id is del f of vD del\nvD with vD evaluated at", 
    "VD times small vd.", 
    "And f of vd is given by\nae raised to bvD.", 
    "So if I differentiate\nthat, what do I get?", 
    "I get a, I get b, I just\nwrite that on the", 
    "right-hand side for fun.", 
    "And then I get e raised to bvD\nand evaluate it at vD equals", 
    "capital VD times small vd.", 
    "And so what does that give me?", 
    "So this is vD evaluated at\ncapital VD, gives me ae raised", 
    "to bVD times b small vd.", 
    "And this expression here is\nnothing but my DC current.", 
    "So that is ID times bvd.", 
    "So ID is given by the\nDC current ID bvd.", 
    "But differently, this was a\nlinear relationship because R", 
    "is related to this\nexpression here.", 
    "And that is simply IDb.", 
    "So if I replace IDb by 1 divided\nby R, then I get my ID", 
    "equals conductance times vd.", 
    "So that is how I linearize a\nnonlinear device and get the", 
    "resistance equivalent of\nthat nonlinear device.",
