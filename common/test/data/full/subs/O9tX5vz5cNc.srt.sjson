    "SPEAKER: In this unit, we will look at a whole new property", 
    "of elements.", 
    "We have not seen this property before, it's", 
    "a very unique property.", 
    "It will result in a new class of element that you've simply", 
    "not seen before.", 
    "All of the circuits and elements you've seen before", 
    "were such that at any given instant in time, if I looked", 
    "at a circuit with these sorts of existing components, like", 
    "resistors and so on, and if I looked at the outputs of the", 
    "system at any given instant of time t, the output was derived", 
    "from the set of inputs at that same instant in time t.", 
    "If I just looked at the inputs at that instant in time t, I", 
    "could predict what the output was going to look like.", 
    "Now digital design, we call this the combinational", 
    "property, the combination gate property.", 
    "In this property, I can look at the inputs of a given gate,", 
    "and the output was exactly a function of that set of inputs", 
    "at that instant in time alone.", 
    "This new class of element that will derive from this special", 
    "new property will be very, very interesting.", 
    "History will matter.", 
    "The past will matter.", 
    "This new class of element is such that somehow able to", 
    "capture past history.", 
    "And to predict the value of the output at any given", 
    "instant in time, I somehow need to know some values that", 
    "in some sense capture all of history in their state.", 
    "This property of history also relates to the property of", 
    "energy, a way of storing energy.", 
    "So we will look at a new class of elements that will give us", 
    "these properties.", 
    "History matters could well have been the", 
    "title of today's sequence.", 
    "I'm going to start by shocking you.", 
    "I'm going to show you something that you are going", 
    "to be completely unprepared for.", 
    "So I will start by showing you something that is very", 
    "surprising, or should be surprising to you.", 
    "And then we'll try to figure out why the heck that happens.", 
    "We'll try to understand what's going on.", 
    "So I'm going to show you something cool.", 
    "And then I'll tie it all back by the end of the sequence and", 
    "show you how what we've learned through the sequence", 
    "will really relate to the shocking element that I'm", 
    "going to start with.", 
    "The reading in the textbook for this content relates to", 
    "chapters 9 and 10 in the textbook.", 
    "OK, so let's start with a motivating example here and", 
    "try to show you some thing very, very interesting.", 
    "So what you see here is a pair of inverters.", 
    "So here I'm not viewing the MOSFET resistor pair as", 
    "amplifiers.", 
    "But rather, let me view them as a pair of inverters.", 
    "Where this inverter has input A, the intermediate, the", 
    "output is B, and the overall output is C. And each of these", 
    "inverters, let me just label them as inverter I1 and", 
    "inverter I2.", 
    "So this inverter here is I1 and this inverter is I2.", 
    "So I have a pair of inverters in sequence.", 
    "And I connect the output of one inverter to the input of", 
    "the next inverter.", 
    "So it's an inverter pair.", 
    "I'm now going to look at B and C, the intermediate point and", 
    "the other point, for a given input.", 
    "So I'm going to apply an input waveform that kind", 
    "of looks like this.", 
    "So I'm going to apply an input waveform that swings between 0", 
    "volts and 5 volts.", 
    "And apply it to the input A, like shown here.", 
    "By the way, before I proceed, I want to point out that I'm", 
    "using 0 and 5 volts in a lot of my design here for", 
    "pedagogical reasons.", 
    "I think I mentioned this before very clearly, but in", 
    "most modern digital circuits, we have now gone down to", 
    "voltages that are way lower than 5 volts.", 
    "it is not uncommon to see designs, chip designs that are", 
    "coming out today, that have supply voltages on the order", 
    "of 0.7 volts, or even lower.", 
    "So this 0.7 volts is much more typical of circuits today.", 
    "And in fact, what is really interesting is the kind of", 
    "content you will learn over the next--", 
    "I would say over the next three or four sequences, will", 
    "actually help explain why the world has gone from a Vs of 5", 
    "volts to a Vs of 0.7 volts or even lower.", 
    "Why have we gone to a lower voltage?", 
    "I'd like you to think about if for yourselves.", 
    "But the next sequences will show why we have", 
    "gone and done that.", 
    "But again, remember, for pedagogical reasons, the", 
    "concepts stay the same.", 
    "We simply work with a clean, nice round number, 5 volts, to", 
    "explain all our principles.", 
    "All right, so let me apply this input at A. And let me", 
    "plot out the input A and the intermediate output B, and", 
    "also the output at C. OK so at A, by construction I've", 
    "applied this input.", 
    "So this input looks like this.", 
    "It goes from 0 to 1, and then 1 to 0 from here to here.", 
    "And then it goes back up to 1 again.", 
    "I've applied that input.", 
    "So if everything was exactly as I expected, then at the", 
    "point B, I would expect the signal at B to be an inverted", 
    "version of A. So at B, I would expect things to look like", 
    "this, an inversion of A. If this was a 0, logical 0, this", 
    "is a logical 1, this is a logical 0, this", 
    "is a logical 1.", 
    "For instance, here I see an exact inversion.", 
    "1, 0, 1, and 0.", 
    "That's what I would expect to see at B.", 
    "And then at C, not surprisingly, I see a further", 
    "inversion of the signal at B. And so at C, I would expect to", 
    "see something like this.", 
    "This is not surprising at all.", 
    "So I would really expect to see this.", 
    "And similarly at C, I would expect to see", 
    "this following waveform.", 
    "However, I'm now going to show you a demo.", 
    "In this demo, what I'm going to do is show you the", 
    "waveforms of a circuit built exactly like this at A, B, and", 
    "C. And we're going to see some really, really fun stuff,", 
    "something that should be completely unexpected and", 
    "surprising.", 
    "And so hold onto your seats.", 
    "Let me take you for a small ride, and let's have some fun.", 
    "OK, let's jump onto our demo."
