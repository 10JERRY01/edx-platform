    "SPEAKER: So I show you the circuit on the second RLC", 
    "circuit on the right-hand side.", 
    "And let me rewrite two equations just so that we have", 
    "them handy.", 
    "So first of all, we need to get rid of vA", 
    "in these two equations.", 
    "So we got from looking at the node equation at the node with", 
    "voltage v. I got vA minus v divided by r.", 
    "I got that to be equal to c dv dt.", 
    "And then, for the node with voltage vA, I got 1 by L,", 
    "integral minus infinity t.", 
    "This is vi here.", 
    "vi minus vA, dt, and that was equal to the current through", 
    "the resistor going to the right, vA minus", 
    "v divided by r.", 
    "OK, so now it's just juggle around with a little bit of", 
    "math to figure out how to get rid of vA.", 
    "Let me go ahead and change colors here.", 
    "Let me switch to, ah, let's use green.", 
    "All right, so how do we do this?", 
    "So you can do it however you want, but let's see.", 
    "What I'm going to do is--", 
    "let me try to waste a little bit of time", 
    "here while I think.", 
    "Since I want to get rid of vA, let me express vA in terms of", 
    "v to begin.", 
    "OK, so vA here is--", 
    "and I multiply both sides by r.", 
    "So I get vA is RCdv, dt, and then I move v to the", 
    "right-hand side.", 
    "So this equation in green is just a simplification of the", 
    "equation that I got from the node with voltage v. And I", 
    "have put all the terms in vA.", 
    "There's one term in vA on the left-hand side, and that is", 
    "equal to some function of the node voltage v.", 
    "OK, So let me start messing around with this a little bit", 
    "to see if I can get to the vA.", 
    "So the first thing I notice is that if you look at this", 
    "little chunk here, and this little chunk here, you'll", 
    "notice that those two are equal.", 
    "OK, so I can directly, right away I can get rid", 
    "of one of the vA's.", 
    "OK, so let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So as I get rid of that, let me also do one more thing, OK?", 
    "So here, let's see.", 
    "So I get 1 by l minus infinity to t, vi minus vA, dt, and", 
    "that is equal to cdv, dt.", 
    "OK, well all that I've done here is I have simply replaced", 
    "this expression here with cdv, dt.", 
    "OK, so let me circle cdv, dt.", 
    "And I have brought that down here.", 
    "Next, let me get rid of the integral that's hassling me a", 
    "little bit.", 
    "So let me differentiate both sides with respect to t.", 
    "So I end up with 1 by l, vi minus vA equals cd squared v", 
    "by dt squared.", 
    "OK, differentiate both sides with respect to t.", 
    "OK, so I get the 1 by l vi minus vA equals cd squared v", 
    "by dt squared.", 
    "All right, what shall I do next?", 
    "I have an idea.", 
    "OK, let me continue with this equation.", 
    "Let me write this here.", 
    "And notice that all I'm left with is this single vA.", 
    "So I'm going to get rid of that vA by making use of the", 
    "expression in here.", 
    "So I'm going to take this expression here, and get rid", 
    "of the vA that is harassing me on the left-hand side.", 
    "Before I do that, let me divide out both sides by LC.", 
    "And so I get 1 by LC, vi, and then I get vA here.", 
    "And that is--", 
    "if I divide out both sides by c, I get d", 
    "squared v by dt squared.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Then, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to substitute", 
    "this little expression in there for vA.", 
    "So I'm almost there.", 
    "So I get 1 by LC, vi minus vA.", 
    "And so vA is RC dv, dt, minus v equals d", 
    "squared v by dt squared.", 
    "I'm done.", 
    "Now, I'll just go ahead and do some clean up here.", 
    "So I get d squared v by dt squared.", 
    "Let me move a couple of things to the right.", 
    "Let me move this over, and let me move this over here.", 
    "So if I move that over, so RC divided by LC is", 
    "r divided by l.", 
    "So I get a plus when I move minus over to the d squared v", 
    "side of things.", 
    "So I get r divided by l, and that's dv, dt.", 
    "And then I get a plus v divided by LC.", 
    "And then I get vi moving over to the right-hand side, and I", 
    "get 1 by LC vi out here.", 
    "OK, so this is it.", 
    "This is the second order differential equation that", 
    "governs the dynamics of the node with voltage v, what's", 
    "the capacitor voltage.", 
    "OK, that is my second order differential equation.", 
    "And so now I have to go and solve it to figure out how v", 
    "is going to behave.", 
    "Before I actually go and start solving the differential", 
    "equation, I want to show you another cute little trick in", 
    "terms of how you can find the differential", 
    "equation very easily.", 
    "Here, I used the node method, OK?", 
    "And recall, the node method is the workhorse of our business.", 
    "And pretty much everywhere, I try to just use the node", 
    "method as the one-stop shop.", 
    "It always works.", 
    "It's called the chainsaw of our business.", 
    "However, in some cases, there are easier ways of writing out", 
    "the equation.", 
    "But the node method always works.", 
    "OK, so I'll show you a cute little way of writing the", 
    "differential equation down in just one step.", 
    "OK, let me go ahead and show you how to do that before I", 
    "move on to solving this equation."
