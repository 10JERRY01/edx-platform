    "ANANT AGARWAL: In our next sequence, we are going to", 
    "revisit the small signal trick in the context of amplifiers.", 
    "The reading will be chapter 8 of your textbook.", 
    "Let's start with a quick review.", 
    "We've talked about MOSFET amplifier which was built with", 
    "our little MOSFET.", 
    "It had it's gate, drain, and source", 
    "connected in this pattern.", 
    "So as I've been saying all along in 6.002x, we will see a", 
    "lot of patterns.", 
    "Patterns are stylized ways of building circuits that we will", 
    "repeat over and over again.", 
    "This particular connection of the MOSFET is one", 
    "example of a pattern.", 
    "We will see other patterns.", 
    "We've seen the voltage divider pattern where we had a series", 
    "pad of resistors connected to a voltage source.", 
    "And we took the voltage from between the two resistors.", 
    "That was a resistor divider.", 
    "We also looked at that current dividers that work like this", 
    "where I try to divide up my current in some ratio.", 
    "So these were just some examples of patterns.", 
    "Another key pattern that we saw was a Thevenin pattern", 
    "where I replaced a bunch of circuitry with this pattern.", 
    "And then I connected some device, D, that was an", 
    "interesting device, to my Thevenin pattern.", 
    "So voltage source in series with a resistor which, in", 
    "turn, was in series with a device of", 
    "interest is another pattern.", 
    "A complementary pattern, which is the dual of the pattern", 
    "above, is a current source pattern, a Norton pattern with", 
    "a current source and a resistor.", 
    "And we connected that to some device, D, of interest. This", 
    "is another very common pattern.", 
    "OK.", 
    "With that little quick tour of patterns, let's get back to", 
    "our MOSFET amplifier.", 
    "And we said, to make it work reasonably well with some", 
    "amplification we are going to follow the saturation", 
    "discipline.", 
    "Now, there's really no reason for us to do this.", 
    "We could have picked any other way of using the amplifier.", 
    "But we said if we operate the amplifier in the saturation", 
    "region and when it gets good application.", 
    "And so we said, let's just stick to this region for the", 
    "MOSFET operation.", 
    "Now, in designing circuits with MOSFETs in saturation, we", 
    "first had to make sure that the voltages that we applied", 
    "were such that the MOSFET stayed in saturation.", 
    "So in order to do that, we defined something called large", 
    "single analysis.", 
    "And it just had two steps.", 
    "The first step was to go and find the transfer function", 
    "under the saturation discipline, the v0 versus vI", 
    "for the amplifier above.", 
    "And the second step was to find the range of input", 
    "values, vI, under the saturation discipline and the", 
    "corresponding ranges for v0.", 
    "And by operating the amplifier for the given values of VS,", 
    "RL, and the MOSFET parameters--", 
    "and what are the MOSFET parameters?", 
    "They are K, and VT.", 
    "And based on those two parameters, we know that iDS", 
    "for the MOSFET is given by K/2 vGS minus VT, all squared.", 
    "So K and VT are my MOSFET parameters.", 
    "So for the given MOSFET parameters, and for RL and VS", 
    "given, I could find a set of ranges for my input voltage", 
    "vI, and a corresponding set of ranges for v0, and also a", 
    "corresponding set of ranges for iDS.", 
    "And as long as I operated within those ranges, my", 
    "circuit would stay in the saturation region.", 
    "So that was pretty interesting.", 
    "Let me very quickly continue to review of large signal", 
    "analysis and look at steps 1 and 2 in a little more detail.", 
    "So the first step, as we saw, was to figure out the v0", 
    "versus vI on the amplifier.", 
    "Let me just draw that here, quickly, for your reference.", 
    "So this is vI.", 
    "This is v0, RL, VS.", 
    "And so we did the analysis of v0 versus vI.", 
    "And we found that v0 was given by the expression of VS minus", 
    "K times vI minus VT all squared times RL and that", 
    "divided by 2.", 
    "So that was v0 versus vI for the amplifier.", 
    "And then we said, let's go and figure out the", 
    "valid operating ranges.", 
    "And let me quickly summarize what we saw here.", 
    "So what I'm showing you here is the MOSFET transfer curve,", 
    "the v0 versus vI.", 
    "And notice that the equation here applies only to this", 
    "region of MOSFET operation.", 
    "So I'm just marking out that region.", 
    "This is a saturation region of operation for the MOSFET.", 
    "At the upper end, the MOSFET exits saturation when vGS or", 
    "vI, in this case, is less than VT and, similarly, in exit", 
    "saturation when vGS is such that v0 is no longer greater", 
    "than vI minus VT.", 
    "In fact, when v0 is less than vI minus VT, the MOSFET goes", 
    "into it its triode region, and we are no longer in", 
    "saturation.", 
    "And so we have to maintain the constraint v0 greater", 
    "than vI minus VT.", 
    "So we looked at finding the valid operating", 
    "ranges for the MOSFET.", 
    "And we did so.", 
    "And what we found was that the interesting region of", 
    "operation, the saturation region, was given by this", 
    "range here.", 
    "OK.", 
    "This is the interesting range for vI where the saturation", 
    "discipline was satisfied.", 
    "So the typical example if I had a MOSFET with VT of 1", 
    "volt, it's not unusual to find that the valid range of", 
    "operation is on the order of, let's say, 2 volts.", 
    "And for the demos done in class, we", 
    "picked VS to be 5 volts.", 
    "And the low voltage, in this case, for the", 
    "output would be 1 volt.", 
    "And why is that?", 
    "Well, if my input is 2 volts here, than if this is 2 volts,", 
    "then notice that for saturation operation this", 
    "value here needs to be greater than 2 volts minus VT.", 
    "It needs to be greater than or equal to 2 volts minus VT, In", 
    "other words, greater than or equal to 2 volts minus 1 volt", 
    "in our example, or greater than equal to 1 volt.", 
    "So, therefore, this is how I got the 1 volt here.", 
    "So for a vI of 1 volt, my output v0 can go no lower than", 
    "1 volt and still satisfy the saturation discipline.", 
    "So this was the interesting region for vI.", 
    "Then the corresponding region of interest for saturation", 
    "region operation was given by this region here."
