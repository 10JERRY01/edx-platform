    "SPEAKER 1: Before I go on,\nI guess we have some",

    "And let me pause for a couple\nof seconds and do that.", 
    "First of all, what I\nwant to show you is", 
    "the following idea.", 
    "So as I was preparing for this\nlecture last night, I said now", 
    "here I am telling the 6002 gang\nthat you need to learn", 
    "about analog circuits\nand resistors", 
    "and all of that stuff.", 
    "And you also need to learn about\ndigital systems and all", 
    "of that stuff because these two\nare very commonplace and,", 
    "oftentimes, they\noccur together.", 
    "So I said, well, if I really\nbelieve in my own BS, then", 
    "there should be something around\nme where I can find", 
    "both of them instantaneously.", 
    "So I said, let me do the\nfollowing like an experiment.", 
    "Let me close my eyes and reach\nout and see where I touch.", 
    "So I closed my eyes, reached\nout, and guess what?", 
    "I touched the lowly mouse,\nlike that, the mouse.", 
    "So I said, OK.", 
    "So I said, let me see what&#39;s\ninside the mouse.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: OK, and if I believe\nin my own BS, we", 
    "should find analog little\ncomponents and digital", 
    "components in there, right?", 
    "So let&#39;s see what&#39;s\ninside the mouse.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "SPEAKER 1: All right,\nthere we go.", 
    "So you could recognize this\nlittle resistor here.", 
    "That thing with the little\nband, though,", 
    "there, that&#39;s a--", 
    "oh, here we go.", 
    "We&#39;ll use this.", 
    "So that&#39;s as resistor, OK?", 
    "And you&#39;ll see capacitors\nin about four weeks.", 
    "That&#39;s a capacitor.", 
    "And there&#39;s a digital IC here.", 
    "That&#39;s a digital IC.", 
    "That contains a bunch\nof gates inside it.", 
    "So a few.", 
    "This mouse has not made\na liar out of me.", 
    "So what I just showed you was a\nlittle device that we use in", 
    "everyday life that has both\nanalog components and digital", 
    "components.", 
    "And a large number of the\ndevices that we use in daily", 
    "life are this way, OK?", 
    "You do the same thing\nto your laptop.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "You know?", 
    "You could go try it out.", 
    "And you will find a bunch of\nanalog components and a bunch", 
    "of digital components.",
