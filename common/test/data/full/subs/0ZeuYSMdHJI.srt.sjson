    "SPEAKER 1: Well, think\nabout this.", 
    "What if the sender sent\na value 2.5 volts?", 
    "What does the receiver do?", 
    "So 2.5 to 5 is a 1, and 0 to 2.5\nis a 0, what on earth does", 
    "the receiver do if it receives\na 2.5 volts?", 
    "It is completely confusing.", 
    "So clearly, this first proposal\nof mine, of cutting", 
    "the voltage 0 to 5 range in the\nmiddle doesn&#39;t quite work.", 
    "All right, let me try\nthe next idea.", 
    "The next idea is let me create\na no man&#39;s land, or a", 
    "forbidden region.", 
    "What I&#39;m going to do is since\n2.5 volts is the problem, both", 
    "the 1 and 0 said, aha,\nthat belongs to", 
    "me, and caused confusion.", 
    "Why don&#39;t I say I&#39;m going\nto just disallow", 
    "things in the middle?", 
    "What I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m gonna\ncreate a region here, in the", 
    "middle, that I will call\na forbidden region.", 
    "So in this forbidden region, I&#39;m\ngoing to say that senders", 
    "and receivers can simply\nnot send values in", 
    "the forbidden region.", 
    "So I don&#39;t have this\nmiddle value", 
    "that&#39;s causing confusion.", 
    "So what I&#39;ll do is let&#39;s say\nthis region starts at three", 
    "volts, and the sender, to send\na one, can send any value", 
    "between three and five volts.", 
    "And similarly, let&#39;s say\nthis is two volts here.", 
    "And the sender can send any\nvalue between zero volts and", 
    "two volts for a logical zero.", 
    "Notice here that I&#39;m able to\nstop using quotation marks in", 
    "many cases, and hopefully you\nwill recognize when I&#39;m using", 
    "logical vales versus\nvoltage values.", 
    "So in this case, what I&#39;m going\nto say is any value", 
    "between three volts and five\nvolts is something a sender", 
    "can use to send a logical one.", 
    "And to send a logical zero,\nany value between", 
    "zero and two volts.", 
    "So let me call this threshold\nhere V High, and then we call", 
    "this threshold here V Low.", 
    "In this case, V high\nis three volts, and", 
    "V Low is two volts.", 
    "So similarly, on the receiving\nside, you have a value between", 
    "V High and five volts, then the\nreceiver will interpret", 
    "that as a one.", 
    "And correspondingly, for a value\nbetween zero and V Low,", 
    "the receiver will interpret\nthat as a zero.", 
    "So what do I have here?", 
    "So for a logical one, I can go\nfrom VH all the way to five", 
    "volts here.", 
    "And similarly, for a logical\nzero, the sender can use any", 
    "value between V Low and go all\nthe way down to zero volts.", 
    "And in my example here, V High\nis three volts, and in the", 
    "case of V Low, V Low\nis two volts.", 
    "So I have about a two volt\nrange for a high here.", 
    "And I have a two volt range\nfor a low voltage range.", 
    "Notice that it, again, doesn&#39;t\nhave to be symmetric.", 
    "In general, I can do pretty much\nany kind of design that I", 
    "like, and it will still work.", 
    "Notice that, in general, I have\na choice of what I can", 
    "use for VH and V Low.", 
    "I could have used 3.5 volts for\nV High, or 1.5 volts for V", 
    "Low, and so on and so forth.", 
    "And remember, the reason we can\ndo so with impunity, the", 
    "reason we can do so by our own\ndesign, is because it is our", 
    "choice as to what discipline\nwe agree on in our digital", 
    "playground.", 
    "Remember, it&#39;s our playground.", 
    "It&#39;s our design.", 
    "As long as we all agree that\nthis is a contract we shall", 
    "all follow, it will simply--", 
    "it will be fine.", 
    "We can choose what we want, and\nthen all the components", 
    "that we create within this\nplayground will need to adhere", 
    "to the same discipline,\nthe same contract, and", 
    "we will all be OK.", 
    "So let&#39;s go back to the design\nthat I have, where I have a", 
    "forbidden region in the middle\nof my voltage range.", 
    "And what I&#39;m saying here is\nthat, look, senders and", 
    "receivers cannot send values in\nthe forbidden region, and", 
    "receivers will simply not\ninterpret values within the", 
    "forbidden region.", 
    "So my question to you\nis does this work.", 
    "Let me give you a few seconds\nto think about", 
    "whether this works.",
