    "PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL: OK, hope you had a chance to", 
    "figure this out for yourself.", 
    "This is pretty easy.", 
    "So what is a particular solution to this here?", 
    "Well, it's pretty straightforward.", 
    "Why don't I try.", 
    "As is usual for different equations, most of what to do", 
    "is guess and check.", 
    "So differential equations actually, rather than being", 
    "scary, are actually very simple.", 
    "In most cases, you know what the answer is,", 
    "and you try it out.", 
    "So in this case, let's guess vP equals VI.", 
    "So if I substitute vP equals VI here, that goes to 0.", 
    "And I substitute vP equals VI here, so I get VI equals VI.", 
    "So, therefore, vP equals VI is indeed a solution, so this is", 
    "my particular solution, s so I'm done with the first step.", 
    "That was easy.", 
    "It doesn't get easier than that.", 
    "Now that I have the particular solution, let me go ahead and", 
    "figure out the homogeneous solution.", 
    "The homogeneous solution, as we recall, is a solution to", 
    "the differential equation with the drive set to 0.", 
    "So this is the solution to the homogeneous equation, which is", 
    "LC d squared vH for homogeneous here, dt squared", 
    "plus vH equals 0.", 
    "In the homogeneous solution, the homogeneous solution is a", 
    "solution to the homogeneous equation, and in this case,", 
    "that is for the drive set to 0.", 
    "Let me just write that down as a quick", 
    "note so you will remember.", 
    "So recall that vH is the solution to homogeneous", 
    "equations, which is the equation with the drive set to", 
    "0, so I get the 0 on the right-hand side.", 
    "So as promised, I am going to follow a four-step method to", 
    "solve this, to find the homogeneous solution.", 
    "This is a little bit more involved than finding the", 
    "homogeneous solution for a first-order equation, but it's", 
    "not too much harder.", 
    "So it's four steps as part of the global step 2.", 
    "So let me write that down as steps 2A", 
    "through 2D, so four steps.", 
    "So let me start with the first step 2A.", 
    "So as is our usual practice, we start guessing.", 
    "So we're going to start assuming a solution to the", 
    "homogeneous equation.", 
    "So what do you think?", 
    "What solution do you think might work here?", 
    "What are the class of solutions that you", 
    "might want to guess?", 
    "Don't be surprised.", 
    "It's very similar to what you did for first-order equations.", 
    "The solution that we guess has to have", 
    "the following property.", 
    "So the solution itself must be similar in form to the second", 
    "derivative of the solution.", 
    "What are the various functions that you know whose second", 
    "derivative is the same as the function", 
    "itself, at least in form?", 
    "Well, we've seen this-- we're going to go with something", 
    "similar to what we chose for our first-order equations, and", 
    "we're going to guess.", 
    "So I'm going to assume a solution of", 
    "the form and vH equals.", 
    "OK, hit the pause button and think of this for yourselves.", 
    "No surprises.", 
    "I'm going to assume e raised to st, OK?", 
    "Choose an exponential form where I do not know", 
    "what A and s are.", 
    "I need to figure out what those are.", 
    "So the exponential form e raised to st is such that if I", 
    "differentiate it twice, I still get the exponent form e", 
    "raised to st again.", 
    "And in doing so, in guessing this homogeneous solution,", 
    "remember what I've been saying all along", 
    "about different equations.", 
    "Differential equations as easy.", 
    "We continue to solve them", 
    "commonly by guessing solutions.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "So the differential equations are commonly solved by", 
    "guessing solutions.", 
    "Differential equations are easy.", 
    "In most of the cases, you're supposed to know what the", 
    "answer is roughly, and then you go and guess.", 
    "So now if I assume a solution of the form A e raised to st,", 
    "I should be able to go and write some expression in s.", 
    "So why don't I have you do a practice exercise and try to", 
    "do this for yourself.", 
    "So what I'd like you to do is take A e raised to st, which", 
    "is the homogeneous solution form that I've guessed.", 
    "And I want you to substitute that into", 
    "the homogeneous equation.", 
    "And I would like you to develop for me", 
    "an equation in s.", 
    "So I'd like to go and figure out an equation in s that must", 
    "be true for A e raised to st to be a homogeneous solution.", 
    "You can do so by taking A e raised to st and sticking it", 
    "in place of vH in the homogeneous equation here.", 
    "And when you do that, you'll be able to cancel out the A's", 
    "and a bunch of other stuff, and then you will be left with", 
    "an equation in s, all right?", 
    "And I want you to write that equation for me.", 
    "So that equation in s will be called the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "So go ahead and try it out and then we'll go from there.", 
    "So this is step 2.", 
    "So step 2 is simply assuming a solution of this form.", 
    "Step 2A, rather.", 
    "I'm sorry.", 
    "And then we'll go to step 2B, which is to write the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "And you are going to do this for yourselves before I go", 
    "ahead and show you how I would do it."
