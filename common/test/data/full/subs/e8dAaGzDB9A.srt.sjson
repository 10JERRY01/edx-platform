    "ANANT AGARWAL: Let's look at each of the steps of small", 
    "signal circuit analysis and make sure that we have all the", 
    "tools and mechanisms we need to go and conduct the small", 
    "signal circuit analysis of an example like our OpApp.", 
    "So the first step is pretty straightforward.", 
    "The first step involves finding the operating point", 
    "using DC analysis using the large signal model.", 
    "We have done this a number of times so far, so I won't", 
    "revisit it.", 
    "The second step involves developing small signal", 
    "linearized models for each of the components, each of the", 
    "elements in our original circuit around the", 
    "operating point, OK?", 
    "So let's go ahead and spend some time", 
    "looking at a few elements.", 
    "Now, we've done this once before a couple", 
    "of sequences ago.", 
    "And you saw how to derive the small signal models for things", 
    "like what welded sources and resistors", 
    "and things like that.", 
    "And we'll repeat that very quickly.", 
    "That will serve as the review.", 
    "And then the new component here will be the MOSFET, and", 
    "we'll be looking to derive the small signal", 
    "model to the MOSFET.", 
    "OK, so in general what I can do to derive a small signal", 
    "model is the following.", 
    "So let's say I have a large signal model.", 
    "Let's have a large signal element model that", 
    "looks like this, OK?", 
    "So let's say for instance for this device D, I have a", 
    "voltage VD across it, and some current iD, which is a", 
    "function of VD.", 
    "Now my goal is to figure out what does the small signal", 
    "element model look like?", 
    "So let me say my small signal model will have a small v,", 
    "small d across it.", 
    "And the current will be small id.", 
    "Now this current id will be given by-- and", 
    "we've seen this before--", 
    "this current will be given by delta f of vd delta vd", 
    "evaluated at vd equals capital V, capital D, the bias point", 
    "times small vd.", 
    "So I have some curve representing the relationship", 
    "between idea id and vd, and so here what we do is we find the", 
    "slope of that function at the operating point.", 
    "So it's the slope times the x offset, the slope times the", 
    "small vd offset, and that gives me the small id offset,", 
    "if you like a geometric interpretation.", 
    "And so this would be the relationship between small vd", 
    "and small id, and in a circuit sense, note that this", 
    "component here is a constant with respect to the small", 
    "signal voltage vd.", 
    "And the reason is that it is taken about the operating", 
    "point capital V, capital D.", 
    "So therefore, it looks like a resistor.", 
    "So some resistor Rd, and the resistor is given by 1 divided", 
    "by delta f of vd, delta vd evaluated at vd", 
    "equals capital VD.", 
    "All I've done here is I've divided both sides by id, so", 
    "vd divided by id looks like a resistor.", 
    "And I've simply moved id to that side, and I've moved this", 
    "component to this side.", 
    "So vd divided by id simply looks like 1 divided by delta", 
    "f vd divided by delta vd evaluated at vd", 
    "equals capital VD.", 
    "So this is simply a resistor that looks like this.", 
    "So small vd, and the current, small id.", 
    "So really, what we've see here is that the small signal model", 
    "for a nonlinear device looks like a resistor whose", 
    "resistance is given by the expression shown here.", 
    "So the above works for nonlinear devices, two", 
    "terminal nonlinear devices.", 
    "OK, let's look at a few more components.", 
    "Let's look at a voltage source, a DC Supply Vs. e seen", 
    "this before as well.", 
    "So I'll just do a very, very quick review.", 
    "So let's say I have a large signal model for a voltage", 
    "source given by this, so this is my is, and this is vs. And", 
    "let's say that's given by some DC value, capital V, capital", 
    "S.", 
    "And the small signal model for a voltage source will be a", 
    "short circuit.", 
    "And so here is is, and plus minus vs, and vs equals 0,", 
    "which is the equation for a short circuit, the element", 
    "equation for a short circuit.", 
    "And so DC voltage sources behave like short circuit", 
    "small signals.", 
    "And similarly, DC current sources behave as open circuit", 
    "small signals.", 
    "So that gives us our small signal models for independent", 
    "current sources and voltage sources.", 
    "Next, let's look at a resistor and look at what its small", 
    "signal models might look like.", 
    "And again, remember, I can build small signal models for", 
    "both linear and nonlinear devices.", 
    "You don't have to assume that the small signal model is just", 
    "a luxury of the nonlinear device.", 
    "No, I could build a small signal model", 
    "for a linear device.", 
    "So for example, if I'm [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "right here, and let's say its resistance is given by R, and", 
    "current iR, and voltage across at vR.", 
    "Its small signal model will be the resistor itself.", 
    "OK, so for linear devices, the small signal model and the", 
    "large signal model are one in the same.", 
    "So I can replace resistors with the exact same resistor", 
    "as their small signal model.", 
    "OK, so next, let's get into something that you haven't", 
    "seen before.", 
    "Let's look at what the small signal model for the MOSFET", 
    "looks like.", 
    "So the large signal model for the MOSFET, as you've seen", 
    "before, is given by a three terminal device.", 
    "And in this case, it has a gate, a drain and a source.", 
    "It's a voltage-controlled current source whose current", 
    "iDS is given by k over 2 Vgs minus VT all squared.", 
    "So Vgs is the voltage across the gate and", 
    "source terminals, OK?", 
    "So that's the large signal model for my MOSFET.", 
    "Again remember, the MOSFET behavior is governed by the", 
    "voltage between its gate and source terminals.", 
    "The next question for ourselves is what is its small", 
    "signal model?", 
    "Let go and figure that out as our next step.", 
    "So I've just redrawn a large signal model of the MOSFET", 
    "here, and as I said earlier, the current through the", 
    "MOSFET-- it's a VCCS, a", 
    "voltage-controlled current source--", 
    "the current through the MOSFET, the dependent current", 
    "source, is given by k over 2, Vgs minus VT, all squared.", 
    "OK, that's a large signal model.", 
    "So let's try to figure out what the small", 
    "signal model is.", 
    "Small--", 
    "OK, what is a small signal model.", 
    "So let's start with the large signal model.", 
    "The large signal model is simply k over 2, Vgs minus VT,", 
    "all squared.", 
    "Well, let me have you do it.", 
    "OK, I need to build a small signal model for the MOSFET", 
    "that somehow relates a small signal value of iDs to a small", 
    "signal value of Vgs.", 
    "How do you go about doing that?", 
    "Let me have you go and figure it out and help me with a", 
    "relationship between a small signal value for iDs in", 
    "relation to a small signal value of Vgs.", 
    "So go ahead and try this out, and I'm also going to give you", 
    "a quick little hint.", 
    "For those of you who want to try it out without looking at", 
    "the hint, then close your ears or put this video on pause or", 
    "do something like that.", 
    "But I'm going to go ahead and give the hint as to how to do", 
    "it right now.", 
    "So iDs will be given by delta over delta Vgs of this", 
    "expression here, OK?", 
    "So I take the derivative, the partial derivative with", 
    "respect to Vgs of the expression shown above, and", 
    "you will need to evaluate that at the point Vgs equals", 
    "capital VGS, and then multiply it by small vgs.", 
    "All right, so now go and try this out.", 
    "As a hint, the small signal iDs is given by the slope of", 
    "the function at the point VGS, capital V, capita G, capital", 
    "S, and multiplied by small vgs.", 
    "OK, so I need you to go and derive for me a linear", 
    "relation between iDs and Vgs, OK?", 
    "Go ahead and try that out now."
