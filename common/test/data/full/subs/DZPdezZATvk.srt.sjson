    "SPEAKER 1: So let&#39;s put all\nthe information we have", 
    "together, and look to see if\nour inverter satisfies the", 
    "voltage thresholds for the\nstatic discipline chosen by", 
    "Wintel Corporation.", 
    "So I&#39;ve gathered up\nall my data here.", 
    "So here&#39;s the inverter that\nWintel is considering.", 
    "Here is the static discipline\nthat it has chosen for all the", 
    "gates in its chip.", 
    "When the chip might be a\nmicroprocessor, that needs to", 
    "go into a laptop.", 
    "Here is a picture that\nI have chosen.", 
    "So really the way this will work\nis that this would be the", 
    "output and this part here would\nhave to be interpreted", 
    "as an appropriate input.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at whether\nthe voltage thresholds", 
    "are satisfied by my inverter\ncharacteristics.", 
    "So from a few minutes ago, the\ninverter that we built using a", 
    "MOSFET with a voltage\nthreshold of 1", 
    "volt looked like this.", 
    "So a transition that VT equals\n1 volt and then its", 
    "output was a 0.", 
    "And it was output was 5\nvolts when the input", 
    "was less than 1 volt.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look to see if\nthis inverter of ours with the", 
    "following voltage transfer\ncharacteristic shown here", 
    "satisfies the static\ndiscipline.", 
    "OK, so let&#39;s start.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with looking to\nsee if the inverter satisfies", 
    "the V OH threshold.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to look at is\nto see if the inverter can", 
    "reach a high value that is above\na 4.5 volt threshold.", 
    "And so let me go\nand look here.", 
    "And if I look here, notice\nthat this inverter does", 
    "satisfy a high value which is\ngreater than 4.5 volts.", 
    "So in this case, the high\nvalue is 5 volts.", 
    "And it does seem like\nit satisfies the", 
    "high voltage threshold.", 
    "Let&#39;s look at a few examples\nbecause we can see this very", 
    "often looking at various gates\nand circuits, and look to see", 
    "if they satisfy voltage\nthresholds.", 
    "And I&#39;ll try to give you\na more methodical", 
    "way of doing this.", 
    "So in this case, let&#39;s say I\nhave the same inverter with", 
    "the same voltage transfer\ncharacteristic.", 
    "And in this situation, let&#39;s\nimagine that I&#39;m looking to", 
    "satisfy a voltage, inside\na voltage thresholds", 
    "corresponding to a\nstatic discipline", 
    "that looked like this.", 
    "In this case, my V\nOL is 0.2 volts.", 
    "And in this case, my\nV OH is 5.1 volts.", 
    "So let&#39;s see if this inverter\nsatisfies these voltage", 
    "thresholds.", 
    "And I&#39;ve copied these thresholds\nout here just for", 
    "convenience.", 
    "So one general way that we do\nthese things is we start by", 
    "taking the input thresholds\nand at those points on the", 
    "input axes, we draw a couple\nof vertical lines.", 
    "So for example, what I&#39;ll do is\nfor V IL equals 0.5 volts,", 
    "I will draw a vertical\nline at V IL.", 
    "That&#39;s 0.5 volts.", 
    "And then for V IH at 4.5,\nI&#39;m going to draw", 
    "another vertical line.", 
    "That&#39;s V IH.", 
    "In this case, that&#39;s\n4.5 volts.", 
    "And then what I&#39;ll do is for the\noutputs, I&#39;m going to draw", 
    "a V OL here and draw a\nhorizontal line in this case,", 
    "not a vertical line\ncorresponding to V OL.", 
    "And I&#39;ll drawn a horizontal line\ncorresponding to V OH.", 
    "So in general, when asked to\ndo a problem like this, use", 
    "this pattern.", 
    "Draw a couple of vertical lines\non the V out versus V in", 
    "transfer curve corresponding\nto V IH and V IL.", 
    "And then draw horizontal\nlines corresponding", 
    "to V OH and V OL.", 
    "And now we can do this\nvery simply.", 
    "What you will do is you\nwill look at-- you", 
    "start with say, V IL.", 
    "And what you will do is for\nvalues lower than V IL, the", 
    "output should be higher\nthan V OH.", 
    "And then for values above V\nIH, the output should be", 
    "lower than V OL.", 
    "OK, so really the valid regions\nof operation given", 
    "these curves is here.", 
    "These are the valid regions.", 
    "The hash marks corresponds\nto valid regions.", 
    "Which says that if V IH is\nhigher than 5 volts, then my", 
    "output needs to be in\nthat range there.", 
    "And for V IL less than this\nvalue here, my output will be", 
    "in that range here.", 
    "So any transfer curve that\noperates within those", 
    "regions will work.", 
    "So for example, if I have a\ntransfer curve that looks like", 
    "something like this.", 
    "It&#39;s OK.", 
    "However, what about the red\ncurve that I have here?", 
    "Well, since V OH is 5.1 volts\nand my output of the inverter", 
    "is only 5 volts, notice\nthat my output is", 
    "less than 5.1 volts.", 
    "And so therefore, this threshold\nis not satisfied by", 
    "the inverter.", 
    "So this inverter does not\nsatisfy voltage thresholds.", 
    "And the reason is that the\ninverter does not satisfy the", 
    "V OH threshold because its\noutput is less than V OH.", 
    "So its high output is 5\nvolts and it should", 
    "really be 5.1 volts.", 
    "Let&#39;s go ahead and try\nout another example.", 
    "And in this example, I&#39;m going\nto stick with the same", 
    "inverter just for fun.", 
    "I&#39;m going to pick a\nnew set of voltage", 
    "thresholds given by this.", 
    "And I&#39;ve rewritten those voltage\nthresholds down here.", 
    "In this case, I have chosen\ndifferent values", 
    "for V IL and V IH.", 
    "And let us see if this works.", 
    "So as before, let me go ahead\nand do the trick I mentioned", 
    "earlier, which is I&#39;m going to\ndraw a vertical line at V IL,", 
    "and then a vertical\nline at V IH.", 
    "So V IH and V IL.", 
    "And then, let me draw a line,\nhorizontal line, at V OL.", 
    "Let me draw a horizontal\nline at V OH.", 
    "And let me see whether this\nsatisfies the various voltage", 
    "thresholds.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with V IL.", 
    "For V IL, if I have any value\nthat is less than 1.5 volts,", 
    "then the inverter should\ncorrectly satisfy it.", 
    "So let&#39;s see.", 
    "For a low voltage, I should\nhave a high output.", 
    "But notice here for a value less\nthan V IL, but greater", 
    "than 1 volt, notice that\nI don&#39;t produce a", 
    "correct high output.", 
    "In fact, I produce\na low output.", 
    "And so therefore, this\none does not work.", 
    "This one doesn&#39;t satisfy\nthe V IL rule.", 
    "OK, it does produce\na reasonable low", 
    "voltage, which is nice.", 
    "It does produce a reasonable\nhigh voltage,", 
    "which is also nice.", 
    "And for values greater\nthan V IH, the output", 
    "is less than V OL.", 
    "So that works too.", 
    "V IL doesn&#39;t work.", 
    "OK, so really by the V IL\nthreshold, all the voltages", 
    "between 0 and 1.5 volts\nshould have", 
    "resulted in a high output.", 
    "But in this region, I don&#39;t\nget a high output.", 
    "And so therefore, this inverter\ndoesn&#39;t satisfy the", 
    "voltage thresholds either.", 
    "OK, so this one doesn&#39;t work\naccording to plan.", 
    "So remember, in general, you\nwill find that I take a", 
    "voltage transfer curve and draw\nthese pair of horizontal", 
    "lines for V OL and V OH\nand vertical lines", 
    "for V IL and V OH.", 
    "And then, in the example that\nI&#39;ve given you, the valid", 
    "region of operation for a high\nwould have been here and here.", 
    "So a curve that looked like\nthis, that would be OK.", 
    "Notice that for the green curve,\nif my value had been an", 
    "input voltage less than 1.5\nvolts, notice that my output", 
    "is always higher than\nV OH, I would be OK.", 
    "However, this didn&#39;t work.", 
    "So any of these cases that\nI draw here would work.", 
    "So if I had something that\nlooked like this, this one", 
    "would work.", 
    "This would be OK.", 
    "So this curve is OK,\nthis curve is OK.", 
    "The main thing to notice is that\nin the valid region where",
