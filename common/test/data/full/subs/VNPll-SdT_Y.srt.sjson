    "SPEAKER 1: All right, so we are now ready to go ahead and", 
    "compute the value for [? DR ?]", 
    "based on first order circuits.", 
    "So to do that, let's go ahead and figure out what the", 
    "equivalent circuit that will allow me to compute these rise", 
    "time for the node at B. So what's the equivalent circuit?", 
    "So the equivalent circuit has to do with this piece here.", 
    "So when A turns off, what happens?", 
    "When A is going to turn off, then let's say my output", 
    "begins at 0 and let's assume that.", 
    "Let's assume that the output start off at 0 volts.", 
    "It may not start at 0 volts, but let's assume that in the", 
    "absolute worst case scenario the output starts at 0 volts.", 
    "In that case, I need to find out how long it takes to get", 
    "from 0 volts to VOH.", 
    "So the circuit there is the following.", 
    "When A goes from 5 volts to 0 volts, the MOSFET for the", 
    "inverter X turns off and so the capacitor at node B starts", 
    "to charge up from VS. So the equivalent circuit", 
    "will look like this.", 
    "So I have a VS here.", 
    "And in terms of a MOSFET circuit, this is really my", 
    "input voltage that is going to be charging up the MOSFET.", 
    "And then if this resistor RL, then I have a resistor RL.", 
    "Notice that this is my VS node here.", 
    "And the VS is going to charge the capacitor through a", 
    "resistance RL.", 
    "So that's my resistance RL.", 
    "And then I have the capacitor CGS.", 
    "That's my capacitor CGS and that connects to ground.", 
    "And VS in turn also connects to ground.", 
    "So this connects to ground, this connects to ground, and", 
    "so I can connect them up and stick a", 
    "little ground node here.", 
    "So I hope that is clear that the equivalent circuit that", 
    "reflects the charging of the capacitor is my supply voltage", 
    "VS which works as my input voltage charging up the", 
    "capacitor through the resistor RL.", 
    "And so this is the equivalent circuit shown on", 
    "the left-hand side.", 
    "So the capacitor voltage, this node has voltage VB.", 
    "That's the voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "So this voltage here is VB.", 
    "And I'm given a few more things.", 
    "I'm given that VI is VS. I'm told that.", 
    "I've also told you that assume that the output", 
    "starts off at 0 volts.", 
    "It may not be true, but let's assume that to solve this", 
    "problem here.", 
    "So I'm given that VB of 0 is equal to 0 volts.", 
    "And I'm trying to solve for t is greater than or equal to 0.", 
    "Let's figure out what the output looks like.", 
    "So that is the set up here.", 
    "What do we see?", 
    "So we see that capacitance of value CGS has 0 volts across", 
    "it to begin with.", 
    "So it has 0 volts across it to begin with.", 
    "And notice that VS is a larger value.", 
    "So the volt is going to start by charging up the capacitor.", 
    "So the capacitor voltage is going to start to increase and", 
    "so therefore the model that I need to keep in mind is the", 
    "model where the capacitance voltage increases like so.", 
    "It starts off at 0 volts and is going to charge up and", 
    "eventually get to 5 volts, in this case it's really VS.", 
    "So you based on the intuitive method that I showed you", 
    "earlier, I could write VB directly by inspection.", 
    "First of all, I know that this form of the capacitive voltage", 
    "is given by 1 minus e to the minus t over RC.", 
    "RC is my time constant.", 
    "It's actually RLCGS.", 
    "The time constant is RC, but really R is RL and C is CGS,", 
    "so it's RLCGS.", 
    "So it's of this form.", 
    "I know that intuitively.", 
    "And I also know that recall what I need to", 
    "stick here and here.", 
    "Here I need to stick the initial value, where I start", 
    "out from, which I know to be 0, so there's nothing there.", 
    "And the value I stick here is the difference between the", 
    "initial and final value and that is simply VS. That's it.", 
    "So intuitively I could very quickly write down VB is VS", 
    "times 1 minus e raised to minus t divided by RLCGS.", 
    "Let's just confirm this.", 
    "At time t equals zero this slide goes to 0, so VB is 0.", 
    "So VB of 0 is 0, that makes sense.", 
    "When t goes to infinity, then that the exponent part goes to", 
    "0 and so I'm left with VS. So after a long time output goes", 
    "to VS, which makes sense because the capacitor is going", 
    "to look like a long-term open circuit and as it completely", 
    "charges up to VS the input supply will equal VS and so no", 
    "current will flow and so that makes sense.", 
    "So VB is given by this expression and I hammered it", 
    "out completely intuitively.", 
    "So as a final thing I need to find out the following.", 
    "So what we need to figure out is, what is the time?", 
    "What is the time t that it takes the capacitor to rise", 
    "from 0 volts to VOH.", 
    "So in other words, the time from the capacitor to go from", 
    "0 volts to VOH.", 
    "So for VB to go from 0 volts to VOH.", 
    "And that is my rising delay."
