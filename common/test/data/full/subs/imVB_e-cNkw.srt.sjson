    "SPEAKER: OK, so recall the solution has three steps.", 
    "Find particular, find homogeneous, and then sum the", 
    "two, and then find the remaining constants from the", 
    "initial conditions.", 
    "The particular solution is any solution that satisfies the", 
    "equation for the given input.", 
    "OK, so I could write d-- so vp as a particular solution.", 
    "Then, it must satisfy my equation.", 
    "So this is r, l, r divided by l, dvp by dt.", 
    "ops.", 
    "Let me just clean that out a little bit, use the eraser", 
    "here, and get back to the pen.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "So r divided by l, dvp by dt, plus 1 by lc vp.", 
    "And for the input that I've chosen, my input is vI.", 
    "This is for t greater than or equal to zero.", 
    "I capture those in the step input, and so the form of my", 
    "input is that it is a constant for t greater", 
    "than or equal to zero.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So what is a reasonable particular solution?", 
    "What is a particular solution for this equation?", 
    "So vp.", 
    "So why don't you go try it out, and then let me come back", 
    "and give you the solution in the next little video."
