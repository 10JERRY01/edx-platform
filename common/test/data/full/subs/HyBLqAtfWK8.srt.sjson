    "SPEAKER 1: Well, I hope you had a chance to try it out.", 
    "SO let me go ahead and solve it for you using this voltage", 
    "divider relationship.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So if I treat impedances like resistances when I did the", 
    "voltage dividers and so on in the video, early part of this", 
    "course, let me go ahead and try that now.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So Vc, that's the voltage across my capacitor here.", 
    "I have representative it with its impedance Zc.", 
    "And now I apply this generalized voltage divider", 
    "relationship, which is the voltage across Zc is going to", 
    "be given by Zc divided by Zc plus Zr, times Vi.", 
    "That's my voltage divider relationship.", 
    "And then I'm going to substitute for", 
    "each of Zc and Zr.", 
    "They're impedances, so Zc is 1 by sC, and that's 1 by sC.", 
    "And Zr is simply r.", 
    "And so there I get Vi.", 
    "Hey, I am done.", 
    "OK, simplify, what do I get?", 
    "Vc--", 
    "and if I multiply both the numerator and denominator by", 
    "sc, what do I get?", 
    "I get 1 divided by 1 plus sCR, times Vi.", 
    "Believe it or not, I am done.", 
    "That's it in one single step.", 
    "I built an impedance model of the circuit where I replaced", 
    "resistances, capacitances, and so on with their boxes--", 
    "the impedance boxes.", 
    "And then I simply analyzed the circuit algebraically, much as", 
    "I analyze resistive circuits using a voltage divider", 
    "relationship.", 
    "Boom, I ended up getting the voltage across the capacitor", 
    "without any differential equations.", 
    "OK, let me write this down.", 
    "This is the famed complex amplitude, VP--", 
    "I just called it Vc here.", 
    "This is the famed complex amplitude VP that I have been", 
    "trying to derive.", 
    "And it was easy.", 
    "This is your big aha.", 
    "In case you haven't got that, let me write that down just to", 
    "tell you that this is it.", 
    "This is a big deal.", 
    "In one single step, I was able to write down this", 
    "relationship, which took me differential equations and", 
    "horrible trig and a lot of complex algebra and so on.", 
    "I have it right here.", 
    "A couple of quick thoughts before I", 
    "move on to other stuff.", 
    "First of all, notice that now that we've built an impedance", 
    "model for these linear circuits, all of our old", 
    "friends apply--", 
    "KVL, KCL, superposition, all of these things--", 
    "to these impedance model circuits.", 
    "Let's write that down.", 
    "KVL applies, KCL applies, and because these circuits are", 
    "linear, superposition, Thevenin-Norton, all of these", 
    "things apply.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So I can pretty much treat these circuits with these", 
    "complex impedances as resistive circuits where all", 
    "of my simple analyses apply.", 
    "The second important point to note is where did you see 1", 
    "plus sCR before?", 
    "Where did you see it before?", 
    "Recall the characteristic equation for", 
    "your RC circuit, OK?", 
    "So what this is saying, believe it or not, is not only", 
    "am I going to be able to get the sinusoidal steady state", 
    "behavior from the simple impedance analysis, but", 
    "because I can also observe the characteristic equation here--", 
    "remember what we discussed earlier.", 
    "The characteristic equation has all the information I need", 
    "to even get the time domain behavior of circuits.", 
    "And we will see a lot more of that shortly.", 
    "So this is indeed a big result.", 
    "With this impedance model analysis, I can go ahead and", 
    "get not only my sinusoidal steady state behavior, but", 
    "because I get the characteristic equation out, I", 
    "can also develop a lot of insight into the time domain", 
    "behavior of the circuit.", 
    "So there you have this big aha moment.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So in this situation, you recall we started off with our", 
    "usual differential equation approach with a lot of trig.", 
    "It was really, really hard.", 
    "We took the sneaky approach with injecting Vie raised to", 
    "st.", 
    "But then noticed that we still had to go and do a different", 
    "equation for the circuit.", 
    "It was still a little hard, but we went", 
    "ahead and did it anyway.", 
    "And then, in the most recent incarnation of this, we took", 
    "the super, super sneaky approach, which was the use of", 
    "an impedance method.", 
    "And by using the impedance method, I even got rid of our", 
    "differential equations, and I could analyze circuits", 
    "containing capacitors and inductors, which usually", 
    "result in differential equations.", 
    "I was able to analyze them with algebraic expressions.", 
    "And with the impedance method, what were the steps?", 
    "OK, they're a very easy method.", 
    "Simply replace all the elements with", 
    "their impedance boxes.", 
    "Circuit stays the same.", 
    "The circuit topology stays the same.", 
    "And then you're done.", 
    "And then you simply analyze the circuit using all the", 
    "usual algebraic relationships that you know about.", 
    "And here, you can use KVL, you can use KCL, you can use the", 
    "node method, you can use superposition,", 
    "Thevenin-Norton, so on and so forth.", 
    "And just that you're dealing with impedances here and", 
    "you're dealing with complex amplitude.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So in the past, where you had Rs and things", 
    "like Vc and so on.", 
    "Here you would have Z--", 
    "things like Rs and Cs and Vcs-- here you would have Zr", 
    "and Zc and you would be dealing with complex", 
    "amplitudes such as Vc."
