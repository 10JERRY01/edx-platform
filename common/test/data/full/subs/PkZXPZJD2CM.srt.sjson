    "SPEAKER 1: So hopefully, you had a chance to work out what", 
    "the small signal expression, the small signal relationship", 
    "between iDS and Vgs was, and it should be a linear", 
    "relationship.", 
    "Let me work that out for you.", 
    "As I said earlier, the way you do that is by taking the", 
    "partial with respect to vgs of k over 2 vgs", 
    "minus VT, all squared.", 
    "And you evaluate that at Vgs equals capital VGS.", 
    "You multiply that by the small vgs.", 
    "Let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So taking the partial of this expression here,", 
    "I have a 2 up there.", 
    "So I get k over 2 times 2 times vgs minus VT, all raised", 
    "to 2 minus 1, which is 1.", 
    "And I will evaluate that at vgs equals", 
    "capital VGS times vgs.", 
    "And so that equals, canceling out the 2s, k.", 
    "And I substitute for vgs in terms of the DC offset,", 
    "capital V, capital GS, minus VT times vgs.", 
    "OK, so that is the expression for iDS.", 
    "OK, notice right here something very interesting.", 
    "So k is a parameter of the MOSFET.", 
    "That's a constant.", 
    "VT is another parameter of the MOSFET, also a constant.", 
    "vgs is the DC bias applied between the gate and the", 
    "source of the MOSFET.", 
    "So that is also a constant with respect to the small", 
    "signal value, vgs.", 
    "So interestingly, this whole thing shows that iDS", 
    "is linear in vgs.", 
    "That is not a surprise.", 
    "So iDS is linear in vgs.", 
    "OK, so that the relationship between iDS and vgs.", 
    "So a question for you, what is this device?", 
    "What is this device with iDS?", 
    "It's a three terminal device with a", 
    "gate, a drain and source.", 
    "So it's a three terminal device,", 
    "gate, drain and source.", 
    "Whose iDS relates to the small signal vgs.", 
    "Thins about it?", 
    "I'll give you a hint.", 
    "It is not a resistor.", 
    "OK, so let's go ahead and figure out what kind of a", 
    "device it is.", 
    "I'm showing you the expression for iDS in terms of vgs up", 
    "here just as reference.", 
    "And it's a three terminal device.", 
    "So let's go ahead and write that out.", 
    "Not surprisingly, there's vgs.", 
    "So it's a three terminal device.", 
    "There's a gate, there's a drain and there's a source.", 
    "And notice here that there's a drain up here.", 
    "So the drain current iDS--", 
    "so let me write down the drain current iDS is related to the", 
    "small signal vgs.", 
    "So I have a small vgs here.", 
    "The drain current is related to the small signal vgs by a", 
    "constant factor.", 
    "OK, so what is this?", 
    "This is another dependent current source.", 
    "So the iDS is given by, in this case, iDS, the small", 
    "signal current is given by k vgs minus VT times small vgs.", 
    "So this is a dependent current source.", 
    "It is a voltage-controlled current source.", 
    "However, this is linear.", 
    "This is a linear dependent current source, and the reason", 
    "is that the output current iDS is linearly related to the", 
    "current vgs.", 
    "And in fact, I can write this down.", 
    "iDS is--", 
    "I can replace this thing here with gm, and I get gm vgs.", 
    "With gm, finally we understand w we've been", 
    "calling it gm all along.", 
    "And gm is a transconductance.", 
    "And here [? we call it ?] conductance.", 
    "For a two terminal device, the conductance was the current", 
    "divided by the voltage through the device.", 
    "In this case, it's a transconductance because the", 
    "current through the DS terminal pair is determined by", 
    "the voltage between the gate and source terminal pair.", 
    "That's why it's a transconductance.", 
    "It is the value that multiplies the voltage vgs in", 
    "order to get the current at the DS terminal pairs.", 
    "OK, so this is the small signal model of the MOSFET.", 
    "It is a linear, voltage-controlled voltage", 
    "source whose current is given by iDS equals gm times vgs", 
    "where gm is related to the MOSFET parameters and also the", 
    "DC bias voltage across the gated source terminals."
