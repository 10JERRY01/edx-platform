    "SPEAKER: For now, let's go back to operational amplifiers", 
    "and take a look at this whole concept of negative versus", 
    "positive feedback.", 
    "OK, let me draw out a couple of circuits.", 
    "And I want you to think about the difference between these", 
    "two circuits.", 
    "In the first circuit, I'm going to connect our usual", 
    "inverting operational amplifier connection.", 
    "So in this circuit, I am going to ground the positive", 
    "terminal, take a portion of the output, and feed it back", 
    "to the negative terminal.", 
    "So this is R2.", 
    "And this is R1.", 
    "And I'm going to connect my input, v-in, out here.", 
    "So v-in is going to be connected through R1 to the", 
    "negative terminal.", 
    "So we've seen this kind of a connection.", 
    "This is a negative feedback connection.", 
    "So we've seen how to analyze this circuit.", 
    "The current going in here is simply v-in divided by R1.", 
    "And this current reflects off into the feedback path.", 
    "And v-out is given by minus R2 over R1 v-in.", 
    "Just so there's no confusion, the output is always the", 
    "feedback resistance divided by the resistance at the input.", 
    "OK So R2 is the resistance connected in", 
    "the feedback path.", 
    "And R1 is the resistance in the inputs.", 
    "Sometimes we may have picked R1 in the feedback path and", 
    "named R2 for the resistance at the input.", 
    "So you may have seen this as R1 divided by R2.", 
    "So just be sure that you don't get confused by a change in", 
    "what we call the feedback and the input resistance.", 
    "All right, so this is our usual circuit.", 
    "And this is pretty standard.", 
    "So let me now do a slightly different connection.", 
    "So here, let me ground the negative", 
    "terminal of the op amp.", 
    "And let me connect the input, v-in, to the positive terminal", 
    "through a resistor, like shown here.", 
    "So I have R2 here, and I have R1 here.", 
    "And this is my v-in.", 
    "And this is called a positive feedback connection.", 
    "In this connection, which I will", 
    "analyze in the next slide--", 
    "let me just say that for clarity--", 
    "you will see a complete analysis shortly.", 
    "But I'll give you a preview of upcoming attractions.", 
    "We will find that v-out for this connection, according to", 
    "what we know, is also going to be R2 over R1 v-in.", 
    "Surprise, surprise.", 
    "Let me say that.", 
    "Surprisingly, we're going to see that our analysis is going", 
    "to show that this has exactly the same static output", 
    "behavior, that is, v-out is minus R2 over R1 times v-in.", 
    "So this is weird.", 
    "And both seem to give the same kind of behavior, based on the", 
    "analysis that we've seen so far.", 
    "But clearly, there is something weird going on.", 
    "This cannot possibly work.", 
    "This is not negative feedback.", 
    "It is positive feedback.", 
    "And just to show you what happens, I would like to do--", 
    "think of it as a manual simulation.", 
    "OK, so let's do a manual simulation.", 
    "And what I'm going to do in this simulation is I'm going", 
    "to apply a small perturbation.", 
    "I'm going to apply a small perturbation to the circuit", 
    "and show you what happens to the output when I apply that", 
    "perturbation.", 
    "So let's walk through this and look at what happens when", 
    "there's a perturbation in both of the circuits.", 
    "To start, let me do a small perturbation for our negative", 
    "feedback operational amplifier.", 
    "And we've done this before, so this is not new to you.", 
    "So let's say, for example, v-out tends to bump up because", 
    "of noise or something.", 
    "Let's say v-out is trying to go slightly higher, just tries", 
    "to go slightly higher, like in this arrow shown here.", 
    "So what happens?", 
    "That feedback, the negative feedback path, takes that", 
    "little up arrow and feeds a portion of it back to the", 
    "negative input as a small up arrow.", 
    "So right there, what happens?", 
    "The op amp, with its massive gain A takes that small little", 
    "up arrow, and because of the negative sign here, converts", 
    "that into a-- whoomp--", 
    "into a big force pushing it back down.", 
    "So what that does is that any tendency of the op amp to move", 
    "in a given direction is counterbalanced by a massive", 
    "force in the opposite direction.", 
    "So this is the power of negative feedback.", 
    "It is trying to make the output stay where it is by", 
    "forcing the output in the opposite direction in which it", 
    "wants to go.", 
    "OK, now let's go to the positive feedback", 
    "and see what happens.", 
    "Let me change colors here.", 
    "OK, so let's see what happens at the", 
    "positive feedback situation.", 
    "So let's say, much like in the previous case, I get a small", 
    "perturbation, due to noise or whatever.", 
    "It's as if someone's trying to grab this output", 
    "here and pull it up.", 
    "I'm trying to push the output up.", 
    "So temporarily, the output goes up.", 
    "And as you might expect, because of the feedback path,", 
    "I'm feeding a portion of the output back to the input.", 
    "So there's a voltage divider action happening here because", 
    "of R2 and R1.", 
    "So a small piece of the output shows up at the input to the", 
    "positive terminal.", 
    "Note, positive terminal here.", 
    "What happens now?", 
    "So now that small little perturbation, which is", 
    "positive, comes back to the positive terminal.", 
    "And that is dramatically amplified and", 
    "fed back to the output.", 
    "So now the small change in A, because a small change in the", 
    "input at the plus terminal is amplified by A and-- whoomp--", 
    "I get a huge response in the same direction as the noise at", 
    "the output.", 
    "That, in turn, gets fed back to the", 
    "input as a bigger signal.", 
    "That gets further amplified by A. And boom, that makes", 
    "it go higher up.", 
    "So you see how things are spiraling out of control here?", 
    "So a small change--", 
    "a small change--", 
    "spirals out of control and causes a massive change in the", 
    "same direction at the output.", 
    "This is positive feedback.", 
    "Where the feedback is not applying a corrective force in", 
    "the opposite direction, it is applying a positive force in", 
    "the same direction as the output.", 
    "What that is really saying is that I could take an op amp", 
    "circuit in a positive feedback connection, and I could hold", 
    "it at this output, v-out equals minus R2 divided by R1", 
    "times v-in.", 
    "I could hold it there temporarily or", 
    "instantaneously.", 
    "But the moment there is any perturbation, in this case a", 
    "slight positive perturbation, that perturbation is going to", 
    "be amplified through positive feedback.", 
    "And the op amp output is going to go higher and higher until", 
    "it goes and hits one of the rails.", 
    "It's going to go up to either Vs or minus Vs, which is one", 
    "of the power supply rails.", 
    "And it's going to saturate and sit there.", 
    "So in any real circuit with a positive feedback going on", 
    "like this--", 
    "boom-- the op amp is going to go and hit the positive rail", 
    "or the negative rail, because the positive feedback simply", 
    "causes any change to be accentuated and become larger", 
    "and larger based on the fact that I've just shown you.", 
    "OK, so let's quickly write that down.", 
    "So the positive feedback drives the op amp into", 
    "saturation.", 
    "So clearly, what this is showing is that I need some", 
    "better tools to analyze positive feedback.", 
    "So what I'm going to do in the next video is, as promised, go", 
    "ahead and do this analysis for you, go ahead and show you", 
    "that static analysis does indeed yield v-out equals", 
    "minus R2 over R1 times v-in.", 
    "And once I've done that, after that, I'm going to go and try", 
    "to build a more sophisticated model of the op amp that can", 
    "incorporate this positive feedback, this temporal", 
    "behavior of the op amp, more into its basic model."
