    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "Now that you've seen the whole theory, and solving", 
    "differential equations, I showed you how you saw this", 
    "ringing behavior from the equation that you obtained by", 
    "solving the differential equation going through pages", 
    "and pages and pages of math.", 
    "Now I'm going to show you things that you will really", 
    "use in this course.", 
    "And particularly, not just this course, but also as you", 
    "analyze circuits and so on later on in life, most of what", 
    "you do will be based on intuition and doing what I", 
    "want to show you now.", 
    "The key to notice here in all of this is that the", 
    "characteristic equation really tells the entire story.", 
    "That's just an amazing fact.", 
    "If you're looking for the next aha moment in this course, I'm", 
    "just going to show you that the characteristic equation is", 
    "going to tell you most of what you want to know in order to", 
    "be able to develop this entire waveform.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's write down the characteristic equation and", 
    "see if that is indeed true.", 
    "So the characteristic equation for the RLC circuit, for the", 
    "R-L-C circuit, is this.", 
    "We wrote it down as s squared plus RLs plus 1", 
    "by LC equals 0.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So this was for--", 
    "I should be clear-- series.", 
    "For the series RLC circuit, this was a", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And then I connected it to the canonic form of the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "So in its canonic form of the characteristic equation is", 
    "given by, you write that as s squared plus 2 alpha s plus", 
    "omega naught squared equals 0.", 
    "So let's stare at that for a second.", 
    "And I'm going to show you that you can develop this entire", 
    "response pretty much based on the characteristic equation", 
    "and the initial condition.", 
    "Let me show you how to explain the whole thing.", 
    "So let's see here.", 
    "So I match R divided by L to 2 alpha.", 
    "I know omega naught squared is 1 divided by LC.", 
    "So let me write down a bunch of things.", 
    "Before I do that, let's look at this wave form here.", 
    "What are the important features of this", 
    "ringing wave form?", 
    "One feature of this wave form is this", 
    "trajectory here, this envelope.", 
    "And this is e raised to minus alpha t.", 
    "Another important part of this is the frequency of", 
    "oscillation.", 
    "And that frequency of oscillation, as I told you", 
    "earlier, is 2 pi by omega d.", 
    "You recall the cosine expression with omega d.", 
    "So it's 2 pi by omega d", 
    "And the final value is at the input step value, VI.", 
    "So let's see, I'm going to show you that we can explain", 
    "most of these things from the characteristic equation.", 
    "So let's start here.", 
    "So, first of all, notice that I have found alpha from the", 
    "characteristic equation, which is R divided by 2L.", 
    "So for the series RLC circuit, alpha is R divided by 2L.", 
    "Similarly, I know omega naught is 1 by square root of LC.", 
    "I have these directly from the characteristic equation.", 
    "So from that, I can find omega d.", 
    "I can find omega d as omega naught", 
    "squared minus alpha squared.", 
    "So right there I have my oscillation frequency.", 
    "So that's the first step.", 
    "From the characteristic equation, I computed alpha and", 
    "omega naught, and I got omega d.", 
    "And omega d is the oscillation frequency of", 
    "the wave form here.", 
    "So I got its oscillation frequency.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Next.", 
    "Alpha governs the rate of decay.", 
    "So between omega d and alpha, I not only have the frequency", 
    "of the oscillations here, but I also have the rate at which", 
    "the ringing decays.", 
    "So I have two of those components.", 
    "And then, of course, I have VI, which is my final value.", 
    "I get that from the input step, that's my final value.", 
    "And then my initial value at time t equal to 0 is v of 0.", 
    "So I know that.", 
    "That's my initial value.", 
    "I get that from the initial condition.", 
    "The one last piece that I'm missing is how", 
    "long does it ring?", 
    "How many rings do we have?", 
    "So let's say, so this is one ring, so this is one ring.", 
    "One right finishes here.", 
    "Second ring finishes here.", 
    "Third ring finishes here.", 
    "Fourth ring finishes here, and so on.", 
    "How many rings do I have?", 
    "Ha.", 
    "It turns out that I can get that too.", 
    "That is this quantity, write down, called Q. And Q is given", 
    "by omega naught by 2 alpha.", 
    "So if we compute omega naught by 2 alpha, this quantity is", 
    "called the quality factor.", 
    "And lo and behold, it turns out that the quality factor is", 
    "approximately the number of cycles of ringing.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So there you go.", 
    "So once I get omega naught and alpha, and I get those from", 
    "the characteristic equation, I can compute omega d, which is", 
    "the oscillation frequency of alpha, which", 
    "governs the rate of decay.", 
    "And then I have Q, omega naught divided by 2 alpha, the", 
    "quality factor, which tells me approximately the number of", 
    "cycles over which the ringing happens.", 
    "And then I get the final and initial values from the", 
    "initial conditions and the input value.", 
    "Isn't that amazing?", 
    "No differential equations.", 
    "So for a series circuit, I can directly write down the", 
    "characteristic equation as follows.", 
    "And as I change the various R, L and C parameters, I can", 
    "directly get the form of the output just by looking at", 
    "those characteristic equation parameters.", 
    "If you are given some other funky circuit, you may have to", 
    "just write the differential equation, you don't", 
    "have to solve it.", 
    "And from the differential equation, the moment you", 
    "substitute ae raised to sd, from that substitution, you", 
    "can develop the characteristic equation.", 
    "You don't have to solve the differential equation.", 
    "In fact, in another big aha that you will see in a couple", 
    "of sequences from now, you will see an even easier way,", 
    "almost as easy as KVL KCL, of getting the characteristic", 
    "equation from a circuit, all completely by inspection.", 
    "You don't even have to write the", 
    "differential equation down.", 
    "So as a last couple of little items, I'm going to use this", 
    "insight from this video, where I can get the characteristic", 
    "equation, and then derive the form of the wave form here.", 
    "What I'm going to do is complete the story and show", 
    "you a completely intuitive approach along the same lines,", 
    "whereby you can develop the response from scratch just by", 
    "looking at these parameters."
