    "SPEAKER 1: Let me go ahead and solve that very", 
    "simple example for you.", 
    "I'm pretty sure all of you got it right.", 
    "Let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So the power burned by the resistor- consumed in the", 
    "resistor is simply the voltage across the resistor times the", 
    "current into the positive terminal of the voltage, as", 
    "I've labeled across the resistor.", 
    "So power is simply P equals voltage times the current.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Voltage is V. The current is simply V divided by R so the", 
    "power is simply V squared R. Do that easy enough.", 
    "OK, next, the energy dissipated in time T. So", 
    "energy dissipated at time T straight away from the", 
    "definition of energy will be- let's say the energy is E. So", 
    "E is the energy.", 
    "That will simply be the power times, in this case, it's a", 
    "fixed amount of power.", 
    "It's a constant power that's being", 
    "dissipated at the resistor.", 
    "So I can simply multiply that by the interval of time T to", 
    "get the energy.", 
    "So the energy would simply be the power, in this case P,", 
    "times T.", 
    "And since power is voltage times the current, the energy", 
    "will be VIT.", 
    "The voltage is in volts, the resistor is in ohms, and the", 
    "power will be in watts.", 
    "For energy, V is volts, current is amps, this is", 
    "seconds, and the unit will be joules.", 
    "So VIT, joules of energy that are dissipated by the resistor", 
    "in time T.", 
    "OK, that was simple enough.", 
    "So the next example I'd like to do is look at the static", 
    "power dissipated in our gate based on the example that we", 
    "have just seen.", 
    "With the intuition that we built with the simple little", 
    "circuit voltage across a resistor, let's now turn our", 
    "attention to a gate.", 
    "So for our gate, let's try to figure out what the static", 
    "power is on the standby power.", 
    "The static power is simply the power consumed by the gate", 
    "when it is not switching.", 
    "In other words, when I don't have some kind of a one zero", 
    "or other pattern that is making the gates switch.", 
    "So the choice is either zero or a one at the input to", 
    "figure out the static power.", 
    "So for our gate, I can write down two situations.", 
    "When the input is high, here is my situation.", 
    "I still have Vs over here.", 
    "My load resistor Rl- this should be l over here.", 
    "And when the gate is turned on, the MOSFET is on, I have", 
    "the MOSFET in its on state.", 
    "I'm using the SR model for the MOSFET.", 
    "So let me write that down as the SR model being used.", 
    "So I have an Ron for my MOSFET.", 
    "Here is when I take my output Vo.", 
    "I have my input Vi with respect to ground.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And this is in its high state.", 
    "It's one.", 
    "So when it's a one, the MOSFET is on and the situation I've", 
    "drawn here is the one that applies to the gate.", 
    "So in this situation, based on the previous little example", 
    "that we did, the power P simply going to be Vs squared", 
    "divided by the resistance through which the voltage is", 
    "connected to ground.", 
    "So it is simply Vs squared and I have a pair of", 
    "resistors, Rl and Ron.", 
    "So I get Rl plus Ron here.", 
    "So that is my power consumed by the gate when the input is", 
    "in its high state.", 
    "Let me mark that.", 
    "We will look at that again later.", 
    "And let me denote that with a star.", 
    "We will revisit it later and so keep this little starred", 
    "formula in mind.", 
    "The second situation is when the input is low, so Vi is in", 
    "its low state.", 
    "Under those conditions, the MOSFET is going to operate", 
    "like an open switch.", 
    "It still has the resistor Ron but the MOSFET will be in its", 
    "open state.", 
    "And from here, I connected to Rl as usual and this goes to", 
    "Vs and this is my output, V not.", 
    "So in this situation, where is the power being consumed by", 
    "the inverter here?", 
    "The static power here is simply zero.", 
    "And the power is zero because there is no current flowing", 
    "from Vs to ground because of the open circuit that is the", 
    "open MOSFET.", 
    "So my power is zero.", 
    "So, in general, if I have a bunch of inverters and a bunch", 
    "of gates in my circuit, if the input to the gate is high,", 
    "then I'm going to get some static power being burned by", 
    "the inverter or other gate.", 
    "On the other hand, if the input is low, the MOSFET is", 
    "going to be high, MOSFET is going to be in its open state", 
    "and it is not going to burn any power.", 
    "So in general if I have 1,000 gates in my circuit --", 
    "imagine there are 1,000 inverters--", 
    "then if I pick voltages, inputs randomly then to be", 
    "zero or a one, half the MOSFETs are expected to have", 
    "one at their input and the other half will have zero at", 
    "their input.", 
    "So, by and large, half the MOSFETs will be burning power", 
    "and half will not.", 
    "And so, therefore, I take the amount of power consumed by", 
    "one MOSFET and multiply that by half the inverters to find", 
    "the expected power dissipation of the circuit.", 
    "So let me pause with that and remind you that I've marked", 
    "this little expression here with a star.", 
    "I will come back and refer to it later.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So what I'm going to do next is go on to my next example.", 
    "In the next example, I'm going to be beginning to introduce", 
    "dynamic power or active power."
