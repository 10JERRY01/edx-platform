    "SPEAKER: OK.", 
    "Let's go back to our RC example and see if we can do", 
    "what we set out to do.", 
    "Recall what we set out to do was to figure out if there was", 
    "an even simpler way to get vp, the complex amplitude.", 
    "So vp was the response at the capacitor for sinusoidal", 
    "steady state.", 
    "We also saw for the capacitor that the impedance model is", 
    "given by zC equals 1 by sC.", 
    "So here's what we're going to do.", 
    "We're going to create something called an impedance", 
    "model of a circuit.", 
    "In this impedance model for the circuit we are going to", 
    "replace the boxes.", 
    "We're going to replace resistances, capacitors, and", 
    "other of these elements with box equivalents, with", 
    "impedance boxes.", 
    "so let's go ahead and do this.", 
    "I'm going to leave my source as is, just that in place of", 
    "small v capital I, I'm going to say it's vi.", 
    "This is the amplitude of the input cosine vi cosine omega", 
    "t, or think of it as the amplitude vi of vi e raised to", 
    "st. So vi is the complex amplitude.", 
    "OK", 
    "Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to replace each of", 
    "the elements with their impedance boxes.", 
    "So for the resister, I'm going to get ZR.", 
    "And that is equal to R. ZR is equal to R.", 
    "Then for the capacitor, I'm going to replace the capacitor", 
    "with its impedance, ZC.", 
    "And for the capacitance, ZC from here is 1 divided by sC.", 
    "So this is the impedance of the capacitor.", 
    "And as I said before, if we replace currents and voltages", 
    "with their complex amplitudes, so let me put VC here, which", 
    "is the complex amplitude.", 
    "And for the current, let me go ahead and use IC.", 
    "So those are my complex amplitudes.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So now what I'd like you to do, I want you to treat", 
    "impedances like resistances.", 
    "And I want you to go ahead and find VC.", 
    "I'm going to give you an exercise after the next click.", 
    "And I want you to go ahead and find VC.", 
    "Again, go ahead and find VC, just pretending that the", 
    "impedances work like resistances.", 
    "And go ahead and use the voltage divider relationship", 
    "to find VC and see for yourselves what you find.", 
    "You will have a lot of fun."
