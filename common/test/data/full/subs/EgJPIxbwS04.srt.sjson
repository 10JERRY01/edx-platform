    "SPEAKER 1: So let me show you a little demo and show you", 
    "that that's exactly how the circuit is behaving.", 
    "You can switch to that.", 
    "So notice that this is what I expect, but", 
    "this is what I see.", 
    "Look at the purple curve here.", 
    "Notice these spikes that are showing up there.", 
    "This is true, they saw it happen.", 
    "And why is this happening?", 
    "So it turns out that what was happening was that the two pin", 
    "were next to each other.", 
    "And I'll show you a little demonstration here and let's", 
    "see if you can figure out why this was happening.", 
    "So you want to show the.", 
    "So think of these as two pins.", 
    "And the pins are close together.", 
    "I'm just modeling the two pins with a roll of wire.", 
    "And what I'm going to do is I'm going to separate the", 
    "wires and keep them far apart.", 
    "It's like keeping the pins apart.", 
    "Hey, guess what happened?", 
    "Those nasty spikes went away.", 
    "But then, I can't keep my pins a meter apart on a chip.", 
    "Your laptops are going to look 20 yards long.", 
    "You want the pins to be very close to each other so that", 
    "you can have many pins on a chip and therefore have very", 
    "small systems. But then look, I get the spikes.", 
    "So any idea, why is that happening?", 
    "Why is it that when the pins are close", 
    "together I get those spikes?", 
    "Switch to this.", 
    "Any ideas?", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Capacitance between the pins.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Some what?", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Capacitance between the pins.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Ah, we just learned about capacitors, so this must", 
    "have to do with capacitors.", 
    "There is this parasitic capacitor", 
    "between the pins, exactly.", 
    "Here's what's happening.", 
    "So here's what I expect.", 
    "I expect a nice square wave at the output.", 
    "But instead, I have a pin next to me and I have a faster wave", 
    "form driving it.", 
    "And so therefore, there's a parasitic capacitor here.", 
    "And because of that, I get something called crosstalk.", 
    "And the model for crosstalk is some result in resistance with", 
    "the parasitic capacitor and I get those spikes.", 
    "And the 6.002 expert saw the solutions.", 
    "So how do we fix this problem?", 
    "So the 6.002 experts said the way you fix this problem is", 
    "that slow may be better.", 
    "And still of having sharp transitions, let me drive it", 
    "with slower transitions.", 
    "Let's switch to the demo again.", 
    "And you will see in recitation, I'll show you the", 
    "demo very quickly.", 
    "So I have up a sharp transition at the input, which", 
    "is the yellow thing out there.", 
    "I'm going to make the transition slower.", 
    "Switch to a triangular wave and you notice", 
    "the spikes go away.", 
    "Oh no, that's the wrong one.", 
    "The other one.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "The mode is switched to a slower transition, boom, the", 
    "spikes go away.", 
    "Want to switch back to square?", 
    "There you go."
