    "SPEAKER1: Next, let me take the same", 
    "circuit, the RLC circuit.", 
    "And in this case, let me measure the voltage across the", 
    "inductor-capacitor pair, because I want to measure the", 
    "VLC, which is the voltage across the", 
    "inductor and the capacitor.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's take a look at what that would look like.", 
    "And as a usual practice, let's look at this in", 
    "an intuitive manner.", 
    "Let's start by trying to plot what this might look like as a", 
    "function of omega.", 
    "Let me plug VLC divided by Vi, the magnitude of that as a", 
    "function of omega.", 
    "In this case, I can go ahead and use intuition again.", 
    "So let's see, as a usual practice, let's start with low", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "So at low frequencies what happens?", 
    "Well, the capacitance is in open circuit for low", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "So for low omega, the", 
    "capacitance is an open circuit.", 
    "So therefore all of Vi will drop across the LC.", 
    "So VLC will be almost the same as Vi.", 
    "So when C is open, in other words for low frequencies, C", 
    "behaves like an open circuit.", 
    "I'm going to get a one here.", 
    "MY VLC is going to get almost all of Vi dropping across it.", 
    "What happens when the frequency becomes very large", 
    "for high values of omega?", 
    "Well, for high values of omega, the capacitors look", 
    "like a short circuit, but the roles are reversed.", 
    "And L now looks like a very, very high impedance.", 
    "So if L looks like a very high impedance, then most of Vi", 
    "will fall across the LC combination again by virtue of", 
    "L being very large.", 
    "And so therefore my transfer function will reflect the fact", 
    "that almost all of Vi drops across the LC combination.", 
    "And I get a one for VLC divided by Vi again.", 
    "So in this case, L behaves like an open circuit.", 
    "And for intermediate values of the frequency, I am going to", 
    "get some intermediate values of LC.", 
    "And so my circuit is going to go and behave like this.", 
    "We'll draw this out in more detail and we'll", 
    "show you this exactly.", 
    "And in this case, this is going to be omega 0.", 
    "You'll be able to go and check this out in more--", 
    "Let me just erase that, clean up a little bit.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "That is going to look like omega 0.", 
    "So this kind of a filter in which I let through low", 
    "frequencies and high frequencies, but stopped some", 
    "frequencies in an intermediate range, is", 
    "called a band stop filter.", 
    "This is as opposed to a band pass filter, which let's some", 
    "frequencies in a narrow band go through.", 
    "In this case, it kills the frequencies in a narrow band.", 
    "And in fact, band stop filters are very popular to filter out", 
    "the 50 Hertz or 60 Hertz AC.", 
    "And in those case, you build a circuit.", 
    "You pick a omega 0 such that 2 pi times 50 Hertz is blocked", 
    "by a filter like this.", 
    "OK, so there's no confusion here.", 
    "Let me write down this 2 pi f.", 
    "So this times 2 pi gives rise to omega 0.", 
    "OK so for that value of omega 0, I can put a notch out here", 
    "or a band stop.", 
    "And that can knock off the 50 Hertz or 60 Hertz frequencies.", 
    "This kind of a filter is also called a notch filter.", 
    "Let me write that down.", 
    "So this is also known as a notch,", 
    "n-o-t-c-h, notch filter.", 
    "So let's go ahead and do a mathematical analysis of this", 
    "and convince ourselves that it indeed behaves like this.", 
    "And so what I'll do is, let me start by just looking at the", 
    "impedances of the series L, C combination.", 
    "So look at the impedance of series L, C combination.", 
    "So look at this piece here.", 
    "So the impedance of the series L, C-- so let me", 
    "write that on a zLC--", 
    "is simply a j omega L plus 1 divided by j omega C. Notice", 
    "that I can bring j to the numerator.", 
    "I could even write this as minus j divided by", 
    "omega C. All right.", 
    "So next what I'll do is to see what happens at omega 0.", 
    "Let me substitute omega 0 equals--", 
    "Oh let me substitute omega equals omega 0.", 
    "Omega equals omega 0 equals 1 by square root of LC.", 
    "What do we get?", 
    "So for that, I get zLC is equal to j.", 
    "And I'm substituting for omega 0.", 
    "I'll just put omega 0 to begin with, just do an extra step", 
    "here, omega 0 C. And then let me substitute for omega 0.", 
    "So I get j 1 by square root of LC times L minus j divided by", 
    "one by square root of LC times C. So what do I get?", 
    "So notice something amazing, amazing happening here.", 
    "So here, square root of L cancels out with L, giving me", 
    "square root of L. And here, square root of C cancels out", 
    "with C here, giving me square root of C up here.", 
    "So what do I get?", 
    "I get j times square root of L divided by C minus j times--", 
    "I take a L up to the numerator.", 
    "So I get square root of L divided by square root of C.", 
    "And lo and behold, lo and behold this is 0.", 
    "What this is saying is that when omega equals omega 0, the", 
    "impedance, zLC, is 0.", 
    "So just what just happened there?", 
    "OK, what just happened there?", 
    "Let me just first write down the conclusion here.", 
    "Impedance is 0.", 
    "The impedance, zLC, that is the impedance of the", 
    "inductor-capacitor pair is 0 at omega 0 is 0 at the", 
    "resonant frequency.", 
    "So what that means is my voltage drop is going to be 0.", 
    "We can show that very quickly.", 
    "So if V drop across that will be 0.", 
    "So let's do that.", 
    "So Vlc is the drop across the inductor-capacitor pair.", 
    "That would simply be the drop across the inductor plus the", 
    "drop across the capacitor.", 
    "So let's say my current is Ir.", 
    "And let's say the drop across the inductor is Vl.", 
    "And the drop across the capacitor is Vc.", 
    "And this is my Ir.", 
    "So the drop across the inductance will be Ir times", 
    "the impedance of the inductor.", 
    "The impedance of the inductor at resonance is given by j", 
    "divided by LC.", 
    "And then similarly for the capacitor, the drop across the", 
    "capacitor is Ir times impedance of the capacitor,", 
    "which is this part here, which is minus Irj", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "So notice that this equals this.", 
    "So the drop across the capacitor is exactly equal to", 
    "the drop across the inductor.", 
    "But there's a minus sign here.", 
    "So what that means is that the voltage drop at resonance", 
    "across the inductor is exactly out of phase with the voltage", 
    "across the capacitor.", 
    "So if the drop across the inductor is one volt at any", 
    "given instant in time, the drop across the capacitor will", 
    "be minus 1 volt.", 
    "So 1 minus 1 is 0.", 
    "So for all points in time, whatever drops across the", 
    "inductor will drop across the capacitor, but to", 
    "the negative side.", 
    "This is telling me that.", 
    "And so because the drop across the inductor is exactly equal", 
    "but opposite to that of the capacitor, both of them will", 
    "keep canceling out and end up with the drop being 0.", 
    "So at resonance for all time as the sign you saw it", 
    "progresses, the drop across the inductor-capacitor", 
    "pair will be 0.", 
    "So let me just write down what we saw conceptually.", 
    "It's an important concept.", 
    "So hopefully you can dwell on it for a little bit.", 
    "So because the drop across the inductor is exactly equal but", 
    "opposite in sign, in magnitude to the drop across the", 
    "capacitor, the two of them cancel out, giving rise to a", 
    "short circuit between L and C. So this is the reason why I", 
    "get this 0 here that gives me exactly 0 volts.", 
    "Because of this property, that the impedances of the inductor", 
    "and capacitor are such that the voltage drop across them", 
    "are exactly equal but of opposite polarity.", 
    "And thereby the two of them cancel out."
