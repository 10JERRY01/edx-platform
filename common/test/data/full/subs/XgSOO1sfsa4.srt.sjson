    "SPEAKER 1: OK, let&#39;s now work\non the second method of", 
    "circuit analysis.", 
    "This is actually a very\nsimple method.", 
    "And oftentimes when you&#39;re\napplying some of the more", 
    "sophisticated methods, it is\nhelpful to apply these methods", 
    "as some of the partial steps.", 
    "You can find more about this\nmethod and the KVL KCL method", 
    "in chapter two of\nthe textbook.", 
    "So this method is very simple.", 
    "If you have a set of resistors\nin series, R1 through RN, then", 
    "you can write up an equivalent\nresistor whose resistance is", 
    "equal to the sum of the\nindividual resistances.", 
    "Now you can also do a\ncomplimentary circuit.", 
    "You can make a set\nof conductances.", 
    "Notice that G is our\nnomenclature for conductance.", 
    "So G1, for example, is 1 divided\nby R1 and so on, so", 
    "G&#39;s a conductance.", 
    "So when I have a set of\nconductances in parallel, then", 
    "I can add them all up and\nreplace them with a resulting", 
    "conductance given by G1 plus\nG2 plus G3 dot dot dot GN,", 
    "where G1 equals 1 by RI\nis a conductance.", 
    "Another simple thing to remember\nis when you have two", 
    "resistances in parallel, let&#39;s\nsay R1 and R2, the equivalent", 
    "resistance is given by R1\nR2 divide by R1 plus R2.", 
    "This is just a special case\nfor two resistors.", 
    "Let&#39;s continue one with element\ncombinations rules.", 
    "In case C is when I have two\nvoltage sources in --parallel-- (should be series).", 
    "Let&#39;s call them V1 and V2.", 
    "Then I can replace them with a\nsingle voltage source whose", 
    "voltage is given\nby V1 plus V2.", 
    "I can get the current based\ncircuit in a similar manner.", 
    "So let&#39;s say I have two current\nsources in parallel,", 
    "I1 in parallel with I2.", 
    "Then I can replace them with a\nsingle current source whose", 
    "current is I1 plus I2.", 
    "In this example, I would like\nto use element combination", 
    "rules to solve for the\nfollowing situation.", 
    "So I have a little circuit here\nwith a voltage source of", 
    "three resistors.", 
    "And let&#39;s say I care about\nfinding the current I through", 
    "that branch.", 
    "So how do I go about doing it?", 
    "So let&#39;s start applying element\ncombination rules.", 
    "As a first step, let me combine\nthese two resistances.", 
    "And so I get the same voltage\nsource, my resistance R1 here.", 
    "But in place of R2 and R3,\nI get the combination of", 
    "resistors given by R2 R3\n3 divide by R2 plus R3.", 
    "Now as soon as I get that, I\nnow have two resistances in", 
    "series, so I can sum them\nup very quickly like so.", 
    "And I can get a single\nresistance here, R, which is", 
    "the sum of R1 plus R2 R3\ndivide by R2 plus R3.", 
    "So now notice that this was my\ncurrent that I needed to find.", 
    "And I was the current\nI needed to find.", 
    "So I brought this down to\na very simple pattern.", 
    "And so I can very quickly write\nI is simply given by V", 
    "divided by R.", 
    "Now the textbook in this\nparticular section gives you a", 
    "lot more interesting examples\nof how you can use intuitive", 
    "analysis to analyze many,\nmany circuits like this.", 
    "And I would encourage you to\ngo and read that section", 
    "that&#39;s part of section two.",
