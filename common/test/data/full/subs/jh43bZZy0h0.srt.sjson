    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so next, I'm just going to go ahead and", 
    "write the solution for the inductor based on what I did", 
    "for the capacitor, OK?", 
    "So for the capacitor, recall the following for the", 
    "capacitor circuit.", 
    "This was the differential equation for", 
    "the capacitor circuit.", 
    "And for the voltage source resistor and capacitor, RC.", 
    "And this was VI.", 
    "OK, and the voltage here-- oops--", 
    "and that voltage here was VC.", 
    "So for the capacitor circuit, this was my", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "And this was my initial condition.", 
    "And this was the input voltage.", 
    "I picked VI as a DC value.", 
    "And VD of zero was picked as V0.", 
    "And for those sets of conditions, I", 
    "found this as my solution.", 
    "So let me ahead and write the corresponding items for my", 
    "inductive LR circuit, OK?", 
    "So let's start with the input.", 
    "So the input, II of D for the inductor.", 
    "It was taken as II.", 
    "And then, IL of Z, the inductor current of time T", 
    "equal to zero, my initial condition was taken as I0.", 
    "And the differential equation that I had for the inductor", 
    "was L/R dil by dt plus il.", 
    "And that was equal to II.", 
    "OK, so you see the exact corresponding between the", 
    "inductor and the capacitor circuits.", 
    "And the two are duals of each other.", 
    "So now I'm just going to go ahead and write the solution", 
    "simply by inspection.", 
    "OK, so notice that the solution here will be some il", 
    "of D. And that is going to equal to something.", 
    "So the differential equations are the form is identical,", 
    "absolutely identical, OK?", 
    "So the solutions are going to be identical, OK?", 
    "So in my solution, I replace VC with il, OK?", 
    "Done that.", 
    "Next, in my solution, I go ahead and replace VI with the", 
    "corresponding value for the inductor.", 
    "So for the inductor, the value was II.", 
    "So let me go ahead and write down II.", 
    "OK, plus I have another II here.", 
    "Let me write that down there.", 
    "And then, V0 gets replaced with I0, OK?", 
    "So in this equation here, VI gets replaced with II.", 
    "il replaces VC, OK?", 
    "So that's my expression.", 
    "And then I get e to the minus t divided by tau where tau,", 
    "for the inductor, is given by L/R.", 
    "OK, so for the capacitor, this was e minus t/tau, OK?", 
    "So that's exactly the same for the inductor, just that tau is", 
    "L/R. All right, that was really simple.", 
    "Now let me go ahead and do a plot here for the capacitor,", 
    "the equation.", 
    "This is the plot that I got as a function of time.", 
    "I had that initial voltage, V naught.", 
    "And then it went all the way up and settled out at the", 
    "voltage drive VI.", 
    "For the inductor, aha, I found a little bug here.", 
    "This should really be IL, OK?", 
    "It's not that similar.", 
    "OK, so for IL, I start off with a initial current, I0.", 
    "And I can see that from the equation as well, when time T", 
    "is equal to zero, the e raised to minus t", 
    "over tau goes to zero.", 
    "II and minus II cancel out.", 
    "So I'm left with I0.", 
    "And then finally, for a long time, when t is equal to", 
    "infinity, that I term goes to zero, leaving just II, OK?", 
    "So after a long time, this value is II.", 
    "OK, II is the drive current.", 
    "And again, that is not surprising because, if you", 
    "look at the circuit here, here's my inductor.", 
    "What's going to happen is that the inductor current keeps", 
    "increasing.", 
    "And eventually, all of the current that is here, II,", 
    "begins to flow across the inductor, OK?", 
    "So the inductor then simply begins to take the current and", 
    "the entire II begins to flow through the inductor.", 
    "So continuing with this, and then, between these two", 
    "points, my current increases in the following manner.", 
    "And this is what I get, OK?", 
    "So this rise here is given by this expression.", 
    "OK, the slope.", 
    "The slope, at this point, intersects", 
    "with the final value.", 
    "And if I take the T intercept of that, that is the time", 
    "constant given by L divided by R. OK, that's the slope of the", 
    "curve, of the rise time of the inductor at", 
    "time T equal to zero.", 
    "A couple of interesting points to observe at this point.", 
    "The first point is that, when all the current II begins to", 
    "flow through the inductor, so when all of this thing begins", 
    "to flow through the inductor, the inductor current is going", 
    "to be a constant at II, OK?", 
    "And when it becomes a constant at II, LD by DT is zero.", 
    "And so the voltage across inductor is", 
    "going to be zero, OK?", 
    "So the voltage across the inductor and, therefore, the", 
    "voltage across the resistor is also zero.", 
    "There's going to be no current through the resistor, OK?", 
    "And so all this current will simply", 
    "flow through the inductor.", 
    "And this is what this curve shows, that all the I begins", 
    "to flow through the inductor.", 
    "And the rise time has a time constant tau.", 
    "So notice how similar these two curves are.", 
    "And again, it goes to show you the duality property all", 
    "inductive and capacitive circuits.", 
    "OK, let me just mark this to be very clear.", 
    "This is T. And just make it very clear that this is an", 
    "important equation.", 
    "Oh, I made a little bit of a mess out here.", 
    "So just to be clear, this is e raised to", 
    "minus t over tau, OK?", 
    "I think we should be done with that."
