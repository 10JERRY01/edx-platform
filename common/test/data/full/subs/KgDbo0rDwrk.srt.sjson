    "SPEAKER 1: The moment the output hits minus 15 volts,", 
    "then, as the sixth step, v plus goes to minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "So v plus goes to minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "So what happens then?", 
    "If v plus goes to minus 7.5 volts, I now have a big", 
    "negative voltage between v plus and v minus.", 
    "So at that point, even if the voltage vi begins to meander", 
    "around 7.5--", 
    "let's say, because of noise, from 7.6 it goes to 7.7.", 
    "No problem.", 
    "v plus minus v minus is still negative.", 
    "What if at that point, v minus goes to 7.4?", 
    "Amazingly enough, no change in the output.", 
    "Why is that?", 
    "If vi goes to 7.4 volts because of noise", 
    "instantaneously, notice that, because v plus, through", 
    "positive feedback, has now switched to minus 7.5 volts,", 
    "this is a huge negative offset.", 
    "And so, even if vi changes to plus 7.4 volts, notice that v", 
    "plus minus v minus is now minus 7.5 minus 7.4 volts,", 
    "which is close to minus 15 volts.", 
    "So small changes in vi ain't going to change anything, and", 
    "so even if vi goes to minus 7.4, minus 7.3, nothing", 
    "happens to the output.", 
    "Output stays at minus 15 volts.", 
    "And the remembrance--", 
    "the reason the circuit is remembering the fact that the", 
    "input has already reached 7.5 is this, is", 
    "the positive feedback.", 
    "I've come and changed my v plus to reflect", 
    "the new output value.", 
    "So let's continue forward a little bit", 
    "more to see what happens.", 
    "As a sixth step, my input, my v plus, goes", 
    "to minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "And then, as I said, at the input, nothing happens if my", 
    "input changes a little bit.", 
    "Whether it goes to 7.6, clearly the input keeps rising", 
    "to 7.6, 8, 9, 10, nothing happens, the output", 
    "stays at minus 15.", 
    "As the input begins to drop, nothing happens as the input", 
    "goes below 7.5.", 
    "7.4, 7.3, nothing.", 
    "6, nothing, 5, nothing, 4, nothing.", 
    "That's it, keeps on going down.", 
    "Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, until it", 
    "gets to minus 7.6 volts.", 
    "Once the input gets to something lower than 7.5", 
    "volts, let's say minus 7.6 volts, now what happens?", 
    "Now when the input goes below 7.5, now v plus minus v minus", 
    "now changes sign finally, because v", 
    "plus is at minus 7.5.", 
    "And if v minus is at minus 7.6, then I end up getting a", 
    "plus 0.1 across v plus minus v minus.", 
    "So because I now get to a plus 0.1 volts, then my output will", 
    "switch to plus 15 volts at that point.", 
    "Notice that will cause v plus to go to plus 7.5 volts,", 
    "causing any small changes in vi not to have any influence.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And so on.", 
    "You saw the cool behavior.", 
    "So let me draw you a little chart so you get a better", 
    "sense of what is going on here.", 
    "So I could draw what's called a state diagram.", 
    "These state diagrams tend to capture the memory property of", 
    "these circuits.", 
    "And notice that my op amp circuit has two states.", 
    "One state is where the output v0 is equal to plus 15 volts,", 
    "and the second state is where the output", 
    "v0 is minus 15 volts.", 
    "Two states.", 
    "In the first state, notice that v plus is at 7.5 volts,", 
    "and in the second state, v plus is at minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "I have two states there.", 
    "So let's use a state diagram to understand", 
    "what we've just built.", 
    "So you recall I said life started out with me being the", 
    "first state, v0 equals plus 15 volts, so I", 
    "start off in this state.", 
    "And I said I started off with vi being 0.", 
    "The world is very happy.", 
    "Then what happened was vi went past 7.5 volts.", 
    "So if vi became greater than 7.5 volts, what happened?", 
    "So when vi became greater than 7.5 volts, notice that this", 
    "was the step here, step number 4.", 
    "When vi became greater than 7.5 volts, so when vi became", 
    "greater than 7.5 volts, then my output switched to the", 
    "second state.", 
    "Recall step number 5, my output", 
    "switched to minus 15 volts.", 
    "So recall vi here is the same as v minus.", 
    "So at that point my output switched to minus 15 volts.", 
    "So once I'm in this state, I'm going to stay there until my", 
    "output became negative, went beyond minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "So then here, when my output became less than minus 7.5", 
    "volts, that's when I switched back to the first state.", 
    "So from the state where I was at 15 volts at the output, I", 
    "switched to the negative state when vi became", 
    "greater than 7.5 volts.", 
    "Then I switched to the negative state.", 
    "In the negative state, if vi were to continue going greater", 
    "than 7.5, I wouldn't have any trouble.", 
    "Even if vi became less than 7.5, to 7.4 or", 
    "whatever, no problem.", 
    "I would only switch out of that state when vi became less", 
    "than minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "When vi became less than minus 7.5 volts, boom, I would", 
    "switch to a new state.", 
    "And in that state, I would not change from that state until", 
    "vi became greater than 7.5 volts.", 
    "So notice that, in this circuit, I have a memory in", 
    "the system.", 
    "That is, this state here, the v0 equals minus 15, remembers", 
    "that vi had gone above 7.5 volts.", 
    "And once it went above 7.5 volts, this state says, OK,", 
    "I'm not going to change until vi then goes below", 
    "negative 7.5 volts.", 
    "It remembers that."
