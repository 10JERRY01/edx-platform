    "SPEAKER 1: Let me show you a little demo and see if I can", 
    "try to pull the rug out from under all that you've learned", 
    "so far and show you some surprising stuff.", 
    "So here are the three waveforms that", 
    "I show you up here.", 
    "So this is my A. This is my A waveform.", 
    "This is the B waveform.", 
    "Notice that B, as you expect, is an inverted form of A. And", 
    "this is C. We all expect this, correct?", 
    "But what I'm going to do is let me expand the time scale", 
    "on this so that I can look at these transitions a little bit", 
    "more carefully.", 
    "I'm just going to expand the time scale.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "All I've done is expand the time scale and spread it out a", 
    "little bit.", 
    "And what you see there is quite different", 
    "from what you expect.", 
    "A is a square wave, as expected.", 
    "But B is stunningly different.", 
    "It's a 0, as expected, because this is a 1.", 
    "But here, I get some really strange behavior, behavior", 
    "that is like nothing on earth, like", 
    "nothing we've seen before.", 
    "And then, of course, it becomes a 1 eventually, but", 
    "there's some really, really shady stuff going on here.", 
    "And so far, you're not prepared to deal with this.", 
    "We haven't given you the facility to", 
    "deal with this issue.", 
    "What's the problem with this?", 
    "We could say, who cares?", 
    "What's the problem with this?", 
    "Let's look at the result.", 
    "So I'm looking at this, and I'm focusing", 
    "on this piece here.", 
    "And notice that instead of being a sharp rise,", 
    "it looks like this.", 
    "It's going up a little bit more slowly.", 
    "What kind of problem would that create?", 
    "The problem that creates is the following.", 
    "Let me play around with this graph a little bit more.", 
    "What I'm going to do is take this output here--", 
    "the C output--", 
    "and line it up against the A output.", 
    "So I'm going to line up the C waveform on top of the A", 
    "waveform so you can see for yourself, if something's", 
    "really, really strange and nasty is happening.", 
    "I'm just going to move up the C waveform and line it up.", 
    "What's happening up there?", 
    "If you look carefully, what you observe is that the C", 
    "waveform transitions just ever so slightly", 
    "later than the A waveform.", 
    "Look here.", 
    "And I claim that it's because of this.", 
    "Because of this, the C waveform falls just", 
    "a little bit later.", 
    "And that little thing we see out there is a delay.", 
    "So nothing you've learned so far prepares you for this.", 
    "Suddenly, instead of the output exactly following the", 
    "input, my output is following the input but", 
    "a little bit later.", 
    "And it's this fact of life, that things happen a little", 
    "bit later, is really the reason why each of you and all", 
    "or us keeps buying new computers", 
    "every couple of years.", 
    "This simple, basic fact.", 
    "If this fact of life didn't exist, you would buy one", 
    "computer and be done with it for life.", 
    "Intel would make gobs of money one year, and so would Dell", 
    "and Gateway and so on, and then no more.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "This is it.", 
    "But because of this little, itty-bitty difference here,", 
    "our entire semiconductor technology is charging along,", 
    "trying to do something about that.", 
    "You buy newer and newer computers each year.", 
    "It turns out this little, itty-bitty thing here, that is", 
    "called the inverted delay.", 
    "And it happens because of a specific element that has been", 
    "introduced here that we haven't shown you so far.", 
    "A large part of the semiconductor industry and", 
    "follow on courses and design and so on, focuses on, how can", 
    "I make my delay smaller?", 
    "How can I get to be faster and faster and faster?", 
    "This relates to how fast we can clock a Pentium 4.", 
    "Remember, it came out at 1.3 gigahertz.", 
    "What's the fastest Pentium money can buy today?", 
    "What's the fastest P4?", 
    "SPEAKER 2: 3.2?", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Oh, 3.2s have come out?", 
    "SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "SPEAKER 1: I don't know.", 
    "But Ken claims 3.2.", 
    "But there you go, 3.2 gigahertz.", 
    "It's all got to do with this little, itty-bitty thing.", 
    "You saw it for the first time here."
