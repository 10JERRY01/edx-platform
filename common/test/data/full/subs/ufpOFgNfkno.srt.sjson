    "SPEAKER: Next, let me draw a little picture to give you a", 
    "sense of the various paths that we've taken-- the hard", 
    "path and the easy path.", 
    "And so this will be a nice little mental image that you", 
    "can keep with you as you try to make sense of what you've", 
    "done so far.", 
    "So, in particular, we would look at the visual path in", 
    "terms of finding the particular solution, vp.", 
    "And the reason that was important was that vp, the", 
    "particular solution, was the steady state solution after", 
    "the transients died out.", 
    "And that's what we cared about.", 
    "So let's go ahead and draw a little picture.", 
    "So we have a little circuit.", 
    "And to our little circuit we applied input Vi", 
    "cosine omega t.", 
    "We said we wanted to find the response of the circuit to a", 
    "sinusoid, so I applied this input.", 
    "And then what we did was we went ahead and did our usual", 
    "circuit modeling tricks.", 
    "We built our usual circuit model containing sources and", 
    "resistors and capacitors and things like that.", 
    "And after we built the model, we then sat down and wrote", 
    "some differential equations to that which governed the", 
    "behavior of that circuit.", 
    "So this was the step one of our solution.", 
    "And this was the way we wrote the differential equation.", 
    "OK, write DE.", 
    "Then in the hard part--", 
    "this was the difficult approach--", 
    "following this, we sat down and we did a whole bunch of", 
    "trig, nightmare trig So after we did the nightmare trig, we", 
    "could expect to get our response.", 
    "And the response would be some steady state solution.", 
    "And the response would be of the form something cosine", 
    "omega t plus some phase.", 
    "So I could have gone and done that.", 
    "But then we said that was too hard a path.", 
    "So we said that we were not going to go down that path.", 
    "And we said that instead we would pick a", 
    "slightly easier path.", 
    "And let me draw that in purple, just to show that it's", 
    "a different path.", 
    "So what we did was we wrote our usual circuit model.", 
    "We did do the circuit model.", 
    "We also then wrote the differential equation.", 
    "But after writing the differential equation, rather", 
    "than going down the path of nightmare trig, what we did", 
    "was we took this detour here.", 
    "And here we snuck in a different input.", 
    "We stuck in the Vi e raised to j omega t derive.", 
    "Notice that our goal is to find the output for Vi", 
    "cosine omega t.", 
    "But along the way, after we wrote the differential", 
    "equation to solve it, we snuck in the exponential derive Vi e", 
    "raised to j omega t.", 
    "And then what we found, to our pleasure, was that my", 
    "differential equation solutions and trig became very", 
    "simple algebraic complex algebra.", 
    "I have an algebraic equation.", 
    "And then I have to get myself involved in complex algebra.", 
    "This wasn't too hard.", 
    "And then, following that, what I did was at the end of it I", 
    "obtained my vp.", 
    "I obtained the vp e raised to j omega t.", 
    "So to recall my input was Vi e raised to j omega t.", 
    "And after complex algebra, I obtained vp e", 
    "raised to j omega t.", 
    "And let me mark that with my usual trapezoid, so it's very", 
    "clear what that is.", 
    "And so by taking the sneaky path, I will obtain vp e", 
    "raised to j omega t, which was the response to sneaky--", 
    "let me write that down.", 
    "So this was the response to sneaky input.", 
    "So this was my response to the sneaky input.", 
    "So this was my completion of step two.", 
    "Completion of step two I found vp.", 
    "So I found my particular solution.", 
    "Although in this case it was a vps, the particular solution", 
    "to the sneaky input.", 
    "Then what I did was I went ahead and took the real part.", 
    "I took the real part of my sneaky solution.", 
    "And that gave me my final answer.", 
    "That gave me my particular solution.", 
    "And once I took the real part of that, the real part of vp e", 
    "raised to j omega t, and what I ended up with there was my", 
    "final output, which was the magnitude of vp cosine omega t", 
    "plus phi, where phi was the angle of vp.", 
    "This was pretty straightforward.", 
    "So notice that here vp, the magnitude of vp, and the phase", 
    "of vp came directly from the component in this little", 
    "trapezoid here.", 
    "And this component came directly from the algebraic", 
    "manipulation of the inputs--", 
    "of the equation.", 
    "So this was the sneaky path.", 
    "What it further did was I got rid of step three.", 
    "So step three was to computing v edge.", 
    "And step four was computing the total solution.", 
    "I got rid of that.", 
    "And I got of that.", 
    "How did I get rid of that?", 
    "I got rid of that because I only cared about the", 
    "particular solution because I cared about steady state, so", 
    "only steady state.", 
    "So notice that I made two simplifications, which made", 
    "things a lot easier for me.", 
    "One was that I got rid of this nightmare trig in the", 
    "straightforward path.", 
    "Instead, by substituting a sneaky input, I was able to", 
    "use complex algebra and obtain a complex amplitude, vp.", 
    "And then I took the real part.", 
    "And then I managed to ignore and did not have to worry", 
    "about finding the homogeneous solution and the total", 
    "solution because I didn't care about the transient solution.", 
    "I just cared about the steady state solution.", 
    "And I finally ended up with my answer.", 
    "So hopefully this convinces you that the differential", 
    "equation method with trig was painful.", 
    "And taking the sneaky end-around path using sneaky", 
    "in the exponential was a fair bit easier.", 
    "So let me go ahead and summarize the method for you", 
    "and very quickly go from start to finish and summarize it,", 
    "just so you all have it in one page.", 
    "And let me do that next."
