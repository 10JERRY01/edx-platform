    "SPEAKER 1: Well, let me go ahead\nand give you the answer.", 
    "So notice that if I know that\nthe Linear Region B applies--", 
    "so the device is behaving\nin this region--", 
    "then notice that since this is a\nstraight line, and this line", 
    "passes through the origin here,\nI can replace it with a", 
    "resistor whose value is\nthe reciprocal of the", 
    "slope of that line.", 
    "That makes it a very simple\ncircuit now containing a", 
    "resistor in place of the\nnonlinear device.", 
    "But notice I first have to\nknow that the device is", 
    "operating in Linear Region B.\nNow, if, on the other hand, I", 
    "figure out that the device is\noperating in Linear Region A,", 
    "then I have to replace it with\na linear element whose", 
    "relationship is given by this.", 
    "So what is the relation here?", 
    "The relation here says that no\nmatter what the voltage across", 
    "the element is, the current\nis going to be 0.", 
    "Let me pause for a few seconds\nagain so you can try to figure", 
    "out what the linear element is\nfor which when VD changes from", 
    "any value to any value, the\ncurrent doesn&#39;t change.",
