    "SPEAKER: This sequence will continue our treatment of the", 
    "operational amplifier and all the cool circuits we", 
    "can build with it.", 
    "In today's sequence, we will look at a different connection", 
    "of the op amp.", 
    "So far, we've looked at negative feedback, where you", 
    "feed back a portion of the output to the negative input", 
    "of the op amp.", 
    "Today, we will see what happens when we feed a portion", 
    "of the output to the positive input of", 
    "the operational amplifier.", 
    "Some really, really fun things are going to happen.", 
    "All right, before we start, I really wanted to touch on some", 
    "of the things that we've covered in this course and how", 
    "they relate to the sequence of material that I promised that", 
    "I would show you in the very beginning of the course.", 
    "So let's take quick stock of where we are and then move on", 
    "to what the topic is for today, operational amplifiers.", 
    "So at the very beginning of this course, we had talked", 
    "about EECS, starting off with experiments", 
    "as observed in nature.", 
    "And I said you could have tables and tables of numbers,", 
    "you could have currents voltages, and you could take a", 
    "whole bunch of measurements.", 
    "And you could design your systems based on those", 
    "measurements.", 
    "But I said that was really, really hard to do, where the", 
    "systems would be things like your iPad or video games and", 
    "all of that stuff.", 
    "So we said what we were going to do was abstract out all of", 
    "this measurement, measured data and observations of", 
    "nature, what nature really was, into the laws of physics,", 
    "or abstractions, such as Maxwell's equations.", 
    "Then we said we would take these abstractions and build--", 
    "it was still too hard to build systems", 
    "with Maxwell's equations.", 
    "We said we would make a set of assumptions that we called the", 
    "lumped circuit abstraction.", 
    "And those assumptions would relate to simplifications of", 
    "Maxwell's equations.", 
    "And that would give rise to the lump circuit abstraction.", 
    "And we did that.", 
    "And as part of that, we got into the EECS playground.", 
    "So this is where our EECS playground began.", 
    "So we got into an EECS playground, and we had a whole", 
    "bunch of lumped elements.", 
    "We had resistors and capacitors and voltage sources", 
    "and MOSFETs and inductors.", 
    "And you've seen all of these things now.", 
    "We are pretty much at the end of the course.", 
    "And so you've seen most of these things", 
    "in this course already.", 
    "Then we said building circuits, filters, and so on", 
    "from primitive devices like transistors and capacitors and", 
    "stuff was still too hard.", 
    "So we said, hey, let's build the amplifier abstraction.", 
    "So I showed you the single terminal amplifier", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "From there, we took two paths.", 
    "One path went down the analog domain, where, in the last", 
    "couple of weeks of learning, we've looked at the", 
    "operational amplifier abstraction.", 
    "This is an amplifier with a pair of inputs, a plus-minus", 
    "set of inputs, and an output, taken with respect to ground.", 
    "We proceeded down this path.", 
    "And down this path, we looked at filters most recently.", 
    "We saw how we could take the operational amplifier and", 
    "generalize the concept of resistance.", 
    "Much like we connected Rs to the op amp, we could connect", 
    "capacitors and inductors and view it from an impedance", 
    "standpoint and build filters using", 
    "the operational amplifier.", 
    "And then, at the beginning of this course, I said, from", 
    "there, you could build all kinds of interesting systems", 
    "using the operational amplifier.", 
    "And in today's sequence, we're going to look at how to build", 
    "the oscillator.", 
    "So until now, we've come to this point", 
    "so far in this course--", 
    "so far.", 
    "So today, we're going to do the last few pieces.", 
    "And today, we look at the oscillator.", 
    "So we're pretty much at the end of the course here.", 
    "By the way, you've also seen the basics of power supplies", 
    "and so on in one of the homeworks that you have seen.", 
    "We took a second path through the course, where the simple", 
    "amplifier abstraction was used in the digital abstraction.", 
    "We built various digital gates.", 
    "And from there, we came up with a combinational logic", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "So we had multiple inputs, and we had", 
    "combinational functions.", 
    "That's where we stopped.", 
    "This is where you had come to.", 
    "OK, today, we will look at the clock digital abstraction.", 
    "I will just introduce that today.", 
    "And that will be the end of it in 6.002x.", 
    "So we'll look at the clock digital abstraction today, and", 
    "we will look at oscillators today, these two things.", 
    "And from there, I told you in the beginning of this class,", 
    "that you could build instructions at abstractions,", 
    "programming language abstraction,", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "And all of these you will learn in future courses.", 
    "So this is kind of the lay of the land.", 
    "And using all of those things, these components from a", 
    "variety of courses, you can build really, really cool", 
    "systems.", 
    "But in today's lecture, we will look at the clock digital", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "And we will look at oscillators and how the two", 
    "are connected.", 
    "Before we move further, I wanted to get back to", 
    "operational amplifiers and show how we can build", 
    "oscillators and then how that relates to the clock digital", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "These other pieces of content, like the instructions at", 
    "abstraction, the programming languages, and so on, you can", 
    "learn in future courses that will be offered on MITx.", 
    "And I look forward to seeing you there as", 
    "well in future semesters.", 
    "These courses will be things like 6.004x, which relates to", 
    "digital logic design and building computers.", 
    "6.846x is about parallel computing.", 
    "6.00, which is likely to be offered very quickly, is about", 
    "basic programming using Python and so on.", 
    "There are the courses that you will see as well, such as", 
    "6.033x, which has to do with building systems. There'll be", 
    "many other courses, such as 6.455x, 6.172x, 6.173x, that", 
    "relate to building various aspects of systems. And I look", 
    "forward to seeing you there for each of these courses."
