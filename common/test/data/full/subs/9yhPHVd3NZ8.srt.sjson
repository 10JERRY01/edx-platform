    "PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL: In this sequence, we will cover", 
    "damped second-order systems. So before we begin, I wanted", 
    "to caution you that there's going to be a lot of math", 
    "here, a lot of theory that I will take you through.", 
    "I want you to stay with me.", 
    "It's going to be very grubby and very", 
    "grungy, but hang in there.", 
    "It turns out that all of this theory and math that you will", 
    "see in this sequence is largely for your cultural", 
    "background.", 
    "You really won't be responsible for it in your", 
    "tests and homeworks and so on.", 
    "However, it's really important to know where", 
    "certain things come from.", 
    "So despite all the math and grubbiness, there will be one", 
    "point in the lecture where you will hear the words", 
    "\"characteristic equation.\" I want you to really, really", 
    "perk up and pay attention at that point.", 
    "The amazing fact will be that despite all the math, despite", 
    "all the theory, despite all the differential equations,", 
    "what we really need for circuit analysis is something", 
    "extremely, extremely simple.", 
    "And towards the end of the sequence, I will show you that", 
    "one simple little thing that you need to know, and from", 
    "that you will be able to more or less predict the entire", 
    "behavior of these second-order circuits simply by", 
    "understanding the characteristic equation and", 
    "how that comes about.", 
    "So hang in there.", 
    "Let's get started with this section, and watch out for", 
    "when we get to characteristic equations.", 
    "From there, things will become extremely, extremely simple.", 
    "Let me start with a quick review.", 
    "In the last sequence, we did the example of a pair of", 
    "inverters that looked like this.", 
    "So this was node A, this was B, and this was C. And I", 
    "showed you the following equivalent", 
    "circuit for those inverters.", 
    "And we said that if I applied voltage A at the input of the", 
    "first inverter, and if I try to speed up node B by turning", 
    "on switch S and have a small resistor, 50 ohms, in parallel", 
    "with the 2 kilohms, in order to speed up my circuit, I said", 
    "that what I observed was a waveform that looked", 
    "oscillatory like this.", 
    "And all that we have seen so far does not quite", 
    "prepare us for this.", 
    "We did look at LC circuits in the last sequence, and we saw", 
    "some sinusoidal behavior.", 
    "But we didn't quite see this kind of decaying sinusoidal", 
    "behavior, and we will see why that is", 
    "so in today's sequence.", 
    "Now, in the last sequence, we also learned that when you", 
    "have a loop like this, there is inductance associated with", 
    "the loop, and we model that as a little inductance L. And the", 
    "relevant circuit to analyze, to understand this kind of", 
    "behavior, was given by this.", 
    "So here was my 5-volt supply, and here's my 2-kilohm in", 
    "parallel with 50-ohm resistance.", 
    "And here is my inductance L. And then I had a", 
    "capacitance CGS here.", 
    "And this was my node B, and this is where I picked my", 
    "ground node.", 
    "So this was a second-order system.", 
    "In the last sequence, we analyzed a simpler form of a", 
    "second-order system without the resistance, just a", 
    "straightforward LC circuit.", 
    "Now what we are trying to do is trying to understand where", 
    "this kind of oscillatory behavior comes from and trying", 
    "to understand the dynamics of that behavior.", 
    "And if you want to go and take a look at the demo I showed", 
    "you for a pair of inverters in the last sequence, you can go", 
    "back and review that.", 
    "In the last lecture, we started by analyzing the", 
    "simpler LC circuit without the resistance.", 
    "And here is what we studied--", 
    "voltage vI, inductance L, and a capacitance C. Capacitance", 
    "C, inductance L, and node with voltage v, and this was my", 
    "current, i.", 
    "So we said let's start by analyzing that.", 
    "And in doing so, as the first step, we wrote the", 
    "differential equation that governed the", 
    "dynamics of that system.", 
    "We wrote the equation for the voltage v. And that was given", 
    "by d squared by dt squared.", 
    "It was a second-order differential equation.", 
    "1 by LC v equals 1 by LC vI.", 
    "And we said let's go ahead and solve this for input that", 
    "looked like this.", 
    "This was t, and we said let's take a step--", 
    "this is for voltage vI--", 
    "that goes from 0 to capital VI.", 
    "So this input could be represented as VI u of t where", 
    "u of t is my unit step.", 
    "The reason this input voltage, capital VI, reasonably modeled", 
    "the behavior of the second-order circuit was that,", 
    "notice when the MSFET turned off, the MSFET at the gate of", 
    "inverter 1--", 
    "so this was my MSFET and this was node B. So when this MSFET", 
    "turned off and if node B was close to", 
    "ground, close to 0 volts--", 
    "let me be more accurate here and say close to 0 volts.", 
    "And then suddenly, what I did was instead of having this", 
    "input connected to ground, I suddenly turned the MSFET off,", 
    "and it is as if 5 volts appeared at this node that", 
    "caused node B to charge up.", 
    "So I could model that for time t equals 0 going forward with", 
    "a capacitance with initial voltage v of 0 equals 0.", 
    "Notice that I started out the world with the capacitor here.", 
    "So this was CGS.", 
    "I'm just simply calling it C here.", 
    "So the capacitor started out with a voltage of 0 volts", 
    "across it, and my current through the capacitor was", 
    "taken to be 0.", 
    "This is what we call the Zero State Response.", 
    "And then we said, the capacitor had input voltage", 
    "across at 0.", 
    "I have no current flowing in the system.", 
    "And then at time t equal to 0, boom, I apply a 5-volt supply", 
    "to the capacitor.", 
    "And in the simplest example, I was building a circuit where", 
    "the resistance was 0.", 
    "So the 5-volt supply would go ahead and appear across the", 
    "inductor and capacitor.", 
    "Here was my inductor with inductance L, and that would", 
    "appear across the inductor, and then that would give me", 
    "the dynamics that would characterize a LC circuit.", 
    "OK, to recap really quickly, in my LC circuit, here is my", 
    "input, vI, inductor L, capacitance C, ground node,", 
    "voltage v, current i.", 
    "I started off with both v of 0 equals 0 and i of 0 equals 0.", 
    "And then I said at time t equals 0, vI took a step input", 
    "to capital V, capital I, and I needed to figure out the", 
    "dynamics of the circuit at the node v.", 
    "And this would reasonably capture the situation with the", 
    "inverter driving node B. At time t equals 0, both the", 
    "capacitor had a voltage 0 across it.", 
    "The current through the circuit was 0.", 
    "And at time t equal to 0, I'm told that I", 
    "have a 5-volt supply.", 
    "And so, therefore, we can go and figure out what the", 
    "voltage is going to look like.", 
    "All right.", 
    "OK, then in the last lecture, we looked at this LC circuit,", 
    "and then we obtained the total solution", 
    "for this little circuit.", 
    "And the total solution was given by v of t.", 
    "We got this by solving the differential equation that", 
    "governed the dynamics of the system as VI minus VI cosine", 
    "of omega 0 t, where we found that omega 0--", 
    "we found the square root of LC in the system, and we said", 
    "let's term that omega 0.", 
    "So this frequency here is called the", 
    "undamped natural frequency.", 
    "And you'll find out why it's called the undamped natural", 
    "frequency shortly.", 
    "mega 0 is sometimes also called the resonant frequency", 
    "of the circuit.", 
    "So this was the equation that governed the circuit, and we", 
    "could plot a response like so.", 
    "So if this was 0, and let's say this was vt for", 
    "an input given by--", 
    "this was t, input vI given by this, so 0 to capital VI at", 
    "time t equals 0.", 
    "So the corresponding voltage at v was", 
    "given by the following.", 
    "So this is VI and this is 2VI We found that the response", 
    "looked something like this.", 
    "It was a sinusoidal response with frequency governed by the", 
    "resonant frequency omega 0, which was 1 divided by the", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "So we observed a couple of interesting", 
    "facts about this response.", 
    "One was that even though my input just went from 0 to", 
    "capital VI, notice that the response at the capacitance", 
    "was twice the input voltage.", 
    "So don't be surprised if you see voltages that go way",
