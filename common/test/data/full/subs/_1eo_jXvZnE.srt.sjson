    "SPEAKER: Digital circuit speed.", 
    "This topic is a major, major application of the kinds of", 
    "analyses you've seen thus far.", 
    "OK, certainly those of RC circuits and the other", 
    "techniques you've learned in this course so far.", 
    "It's pretty amazing that in just four short weeks, you", 
    "have learned about several techniques that can directly", 
    "help you determine the speed of", 
    "contemporary digital circuits.", 
    "But before I begin, as is my usual practice, let me do a", 
    "quick review of what we've covered most recently.", 
    "So we looked at the following kind of circuit.", 
    "We had a voltage source in series with the resistance and", 
    "a capacitance.", 
    "We said the capacitor has a initial condition.", 
    "In other words, at time t equals 0, I'm telling you that", 
    "the capacitor has a voltage v0 on it.", 
    "That's the initial condition.", 
    "And then, the example we looked at previously was an", 
    "input voltage that looked like this.", 
    "The time axis and this is my vi.", 
    "And I said that this was such that at time t equal to 0, vi", 
    "took a step to capital V capital I. That is starting at", 
    "time t equals 0 onwards.", 
    "vi was at capital VI volts.", 
    "And you could accomplish this kind of input in many", 
    "different ways.", 
    "One way you could do this is by using a step input.", 
    "What is a step input?", 
    "Let me just pick a different color just for fun, and try to", 
    "show you how that works.", 
    "So a step input is 0.", 
    "And it rises to VI at time t equal to 0.", 
    "So a voltage wave form for VI that starts at v equal to 0", 
    "for negative t.", 
    "And then at t equal to 0, it steps up to a DC value of VI.", 
    "That's one way of getting a VI that's equal--", 
    "an input voltage that's equal to capital V capital I at time", 
    "t equal to 0.", 
    "One little nugget of information.", 
    "Notice here that my initial condition at time t equal to 0", 
    "is also v0.", 
    "And I'm also telling you that my input voltage at time t", 
    "equal to 0 is capital V capital I. And I also said", 
    "that it could also be equivalently--", 
    "it could also be accomplished by having a step input that", 
    "starts off at 0 and then that jumps to VI at", 
    "time t equals 0.", 
    "Notice that I'm saying two things here.", 
    "That at time t equal to 0, the capacitor is at v0.", 
    "And the input voltage is also jumping to VI at", 
    "time t equals 0.", 
    "Now, in this particular situation, it is", 
    "actually not a problem.", 
    "But we will see some other situations, like with impulses", 
    "and so on, where if I give you two statements at the same", 
    "time, it could be that they are conflicting.", 
    "So oftentimes what we do to clearly indicate what happened", 
    "first and what happened later is the following.", 
    "We can say that the input at time t equals 0 minus is v0.", 
    "OK, what does this mean?", 
    "This means that at the time instant just before t equals", 
    "0, infinitesimally close to 0, but before t equals 0, the", 
    "initial condition is at v0.", 
    "So this means that if I took a step at t equals 0, then it", 
    "means that that step would happen just infinitesimally", 
    "later than t equals 0 minus.", 
    "Various others might write this as t equals 0 minus where", 
    "the minus sign is below the 0 as well.", 
    "So all this says is that the initial condition is given at", 
    "t equals 0 minus.", 
    "And then a small amount of time later, the voltage takes", 
    "a step to t equals 0.", 
    "This just gives you the causal or the temporal relationship", 
    "between the initial condition, or the time at which the", 
    "initial condition is specified and when the", 
    "input voltage happens.", 
    "Now, for our example here, it didn't really matter.", 
    "But we will make use of this later.", 
    "So as part of the review, we saw in the previous sequence", 
    "that the voltage across the capacitor vc, which is also", 
    "the node voltage out here if I picked a ground node like so.", 
    "vc was given by the following.", 
    "vc was given by VI, the DC value of the input, plus the", 
    "difference between the initial condition and the input DC", 
    "value raised to e to the minus t divided by RC.", 
    "And I call this equation 1.", 
    "So RC here was my time constant.", 
    "I could also plot this for you, as I did", 
    "previously as follows.", 
    "So this is my time and this is vc.", 
    "This is 0.", 
    "And some of the interesting locations", 
    "are v0 as an example.", 
    "We look at how this relates to the whole thing.", 
    "Let me pick a different color for drawing the wave form.", 
    "And so this equation plotted out would look like this.", 
    "I would start off with the voltage at v0.", 
    "Clearly I told you that the capacitor voltage was v0 at", 
    "time t equals 0 minus.", 
    "So it was v0 here.", 
    "And then, if you solved this equation, if you looked at", 
    "what the graph looks like, at time t equals infinity.", 
    "So at time t equals infinity, this term goes to 0.", 
    "So this terms goes to 0.", 
    "So after a long time, the capacitor voltage is", 
    "going to be at VI.", 
    "And between here and here, I see a rise that looks like so.", 
    "So that was the form of the wave form.", 
    "This is VI.", 
    "We also said that the time constant RC is a", 
    "slope at this point.", 
    "So RC is slope at this point.", 
    "And RC is called the time constant tau.", 
    "One wa figure out the time constant is just", 
    "to measure the slope.", 
    "Or what you could also do is draw a straight line that is", 
    "congruent with the slope here that intersects", 
    "with the final value.", 
    "And then, you take the intercept of the x-axis.", 
    "And this value will be RC.", 
    "This is just from the definition of slope.", 
    "So this is the time constant.", 
    "So, so far I have really not done anything new, except for", 
    "this little detail about 0 minus.", 
    "And by the way, I should also point out that--", 
    "how do you represent something that is just infinitesimally", 
    "after t equals 0?", 
    "Well, this is t equal 0.", 
    "0 minus comes before.", 
    "And we can represent a signal that--", 
    "a time instance that happens slightly after t equals 0 as t", 
    "equals 0 plus.", 
    "t equals 0 plus says that it happens infinitesimally after", 
    "time t equal to 0.", 
    "So that's it for the review.", 
    "And next, let's jump into looking at digital inverter,", 
    "digital circuit speed.", 
    "But actually before we do that, I would like to give you", 
    "some insight into how you can solve RC circuits completely", 
    "by inspection.", 
    "You don't have to do any differential equations or do a", 
    "lot of algebra.", 
    "Just write things down by inspection.", 
    "Let me show that to you next."
