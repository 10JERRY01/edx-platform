    "SPEAKER 1: Our third method is\ngoing to be the node method.", 
    "This method is going to be the\nmost important method that we", 
    "learn, and you can apply it to\nall the circuits that you&#39;re", 
    "going to see.", 
    "This method is going to be a\nvery specific application of", 
    "the KVL/KCL method.", 
    "This method has five steps.", 
    "The first step would be you go\nand select a reference node--", 
    "we call that a ground node--", 
    "represented by an inverted\nT symbol.", 
    "And you&#39;re going to measure\nall our voltages with", 
    "reference to this ground node.", 
    "The second step.", 
    "We label all the voltages of\nthe remaining nodes with", 
    "respect to ground.", 
    "And these will be our\nprimary unknowns.", 
    "As a third step, we will write\nKCL for all the nodes, leading", 
    "out the ground node.", 
    "And while writing KCL, we\nwill apply a cool trick.", 
    "So KCL involves currents.", 
    "But notice that your\nprimary variables", 
    "are your node voltages.", 
    "But KCL involves current, so\nwhat we will do is in step", 
    "three, we will derive the\ncurrent, in terms of the node", 
    "voltages, and directly apply\nthe element relationship", 
    "without actually having\nto write down", 
    "any specific current.", 
    "Then we go and solve\nfor the node", 
    "voltages as our step four.", 
    "And finally, we go and back\nsolve for the branch voltages", 
    "and branch currents.", 
    "Notice that for circuit\nanalysis, our goal is to find", 
    "branch voltages and currents,\nand so to the extent that you", 
    "need to know all the branch\nvoltages and currents, you can", 
    "go ahead and find them.", 
    "The node analysis method is the\nworkhorse of our industry", 
    "and the workhorse of 6.002x.", 
    "And so you will be using\nit all over the place.", 
    "It&#39;s a very, very important\nmethod.", 
    "Let&#39;s get started.", 
    "And for this method, I&#39;m\ngoing to use our", 
    "old faithful circuit.", 
    "For fun, I&#39;m going to add a\nextra current source, I1, to", 
    "our circuit.", 
    "Notice that we now have seven\nelements in the circuit.", 
    "And with seven elements, the\nnumber of equations is going", 
    "to be completely unwieldy.", 
    "And so you will notice that with\nthe node method, you will", 
    "be amazed that at the\nend, we will have to", 
    "solve only two equations.", 
    "Watch and see.", 
    "So as the first step of the node\nmethod, I have to select", 
    "the ground node.", 
    "Now, in general, you can select\nany node as the ground,", 
    "because voltages are always\nmeasured with", 
    "respect to a point.", 
    "There are differences in\npotentials between a pair of", 
    "points, so you can select\nany node as the ground.", 
    "But in general, to simplify our\nlives, I&#39;d recommend using", 
    "a couple of rules to pick\na ground node to", 
    "simplify the analysis.", 
    "The first thing to do is to\nfind a node which has the", 
    "largest number of edges\ncoming to it.", 
    "And in our circuit here, this\nnode here, which connects R to", 
    "R5, and the current and voltage\nsources has the", 
    "largest number of edges.", 
    "So that seemed like\na good candidate.", 
    "A second thing you can look at\nis look for a node that has", 
    "many of the sources\nconnected to it.", 
    "And in this case, it does happen\nthat the same node has", 
    "the voltage source\nalso connected", 
    "to it with one terminal.", 
    "So let me go ahead and pick\nthat as my ground node.", 
    "So let me go ahead and mark\nthat as my ground node.", 
    "This will be my ground,\nand I mark it", 
    "with my ground terminal.", 
    "So this is step one.", 
    "Now, let&#39;s apply step two.", 
    "Step two will be label node\nvoltages with respect to the", 
    "ground node.", 
    "So what are my nodes?", 
    "So I have a node here.", 
    "That&#39;s one node.", 
    "Let me label the node voltage\nwith respect to ground as E1.", 
    "So if I take this as my\nground voltage and", 
    "take that as a zero--", 
    "so the voltage at this node here\nis going to be E1 with", 
    "respect to the ground.", 
    "Let me pick this node here as\nE2 with respect to ground.", 
    "Finally, I have a\nthird node here.", 
    "And what can you say about\nthe voltage at that node?", 
    "Let me pause for a second while\nyou think about it, and", 
    "then I will continue.", 
    "So what do you think the voltage\nis at that node?", 
    "Do I need a variable there?", 
    null
