    "SPEAKER 1: As our next topic,\nwe are going to cover", 
    "incremental analysis.", 
    "As I mentioned earlier,\nincremental analysis is just", 
    "one way of viewing a really,\nreally cool trick that you&#39;ll", 
    "been learning about in this\nsequence of videos.", 
    "That trick is called the\nsmall signal trick.", 
    "You can think of this trick as\na way of taking circuits that", 
    "might be nonlinear, and using\nthis trick, use those circuits", 
    "in a way that makes their\nbehavior more or less linear.", 
    "Now, an incremental analysis can\nbe thought of as a way of", 
    "analyzing such circuits.", 
    "So before we begin talking about\nexactly what the small", 
    "signal trick is, I just would\nlike to put things into some", 
    "perspective.", 
    "So you are in the 6.002 world.", 
    "And in this world, we made some\nsimplifications called", 
    "the lumped circuit\nsimplifications, and developed", 
    "a lump circuit abstraction.", 
    "And as soon as we made this\nabstraction, we got into this", 
    "ECS playground of ours, and\nwe talked about several", 
    "techniques for learning about\nor analyzing circuits, like", 
    "the KVL/KCL method, the node\nmethod, the composition", 
    "rules, and so on.", 
    "Following that, we said, if\ncircuits were linear--", 
    "so for example, if I have a\ncircuit containing only", 
    "resistors, that is linear.", 
    "We also talked about\nvarious rules that", 
    "make circuits linear.", 
    "Those circuits have to follow\nthe principle of homogeneity,", 
    "the principle of superposition,\nand so on.", 
    "So when I have a linear circuit,\nthen I could use", 
    "techniques like superposition\nand Thevenin, and the Norton", 
    "method to analyze\nthose circuits.", 
    "Then there was the\nother class of", 
    "circuits, nonlinear circuits.", 
    "And we looked at techniques like\nthe analytical method and", 
    "the graphical method to analyze", 
    "those circuits as well.", 
    "And fundamentally, analytical\nand graphical methods were", 
    "simply an application of the\nbasic node method that we", 
    "learned about earlier.", 
    "Within a nonlinear domain, we\nalso looked at the domain of", 
    "digital circuits.", 
    "Now, digital circuits are\ninherently nonlinear.", 
    "Now, we have a switch\nas an example here.", 
    "This is a switch.", 
    "It&#39;s implemented\nusing a MOSFET.", 
    "And these are nonlinear\ndevices.", 
    "When I have circuits like this,\none of the things that", 
    "is interesting is that a fixed\ninput value-- so in this case,", 
    "I have an input A and an input\nB. If I fix the values of A", 
    "and B, then something very\ninteresting happens.", 
    "Digital circuits begin to look\nlike linear circuits.", 
    "So for example, out here, for a\nfixed value of A is equal to", 
    "1 and B is equal to 1, I get a\nfixed switch setting for all", 
    "my resistors.", 
    "And what I end up with is\na network of the sort.", 
    "And this can be analyzed using\nlinear techniques.", 
    "This is quite nice.", 
    "And then we said, within\na nonlinear domain--", 
    "I promised you that I&#39;ll cover\nsomething called the small", 
    "signal model.", 
    "I haven&#39;t told you what it is.", 
    "When I look at the nonlinear\ndomain, and if I look at a", 
    "particular use of these\nnonlinear circuits, a", 
    "particular stylized, disciplined\nuse of circuits", 
    "that I will talk about today,\nthen what is amazing is that", 
    "those kinds of circuits also\ncan be analyzed using our", 
    "linear techniques.", 
    "So let me start with a review of\nthe kinds of things that we", 
    "will cover in today&#39;s sequence,\nand also very", 
    "quickly look at what\nyou&#39;ve done so far.", 
    "So in the nonlinear arena, we\nhave looked at the analytical", 
    "methods, graphical methods, and\nwe briefly looked at the", 
    "piecewise linear methods\nto analyze circuits.", 
    "And today, as I said, we will\ncover the small signal method,", 
    "or the incremental method.", 
    "And you can read up a lot more\nabout this in section 4.5 of", 
    "the textbook.",
