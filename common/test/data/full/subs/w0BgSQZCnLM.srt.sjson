    "SPEAKER 1: Ok, so let&#39;s go\nahead and solve this.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to solve this by\ntrial and error, and in this", 
    "case, what I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve\ntaken my equation one and", 
    "equation two and I&#39;ve simply\nreplaced id in equation one", 
    "with the id from equation\ntwo like so.", 
    "So I end up with vd minus v\ndivided by r plus ae raised to", 
    "bvd, and the whole\nthing equals 0.", 
    "In order to solve it, let me\nreorganize this a little bit.", 
    "I&#39;ll just bring vd to the left\nhand side and clean up the", 
    "stuff, multiply the whole\nthing out by r.", 
    "So we&#39;ll multiply the whole\nthing out by r, and leave vd", 
    "on the right hand side,\nI end up with this.", 
    "So vd equals--", 
    "so I&#39;m going to take v to the\nright hand side, so I get v.", 
    "And then I multiply out by r,\nand I end up with taking this", 
    "to the right hand side.", 
    "So I get rae to the bvd on\nthe right hand side.", 
    "So this is what I get.", 
    "So this is the equation that\nI would like to solve.", 
    "And notice that any value of\nvd that satisfies this", 
    "equation will give\nyou an answer.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and\ntry to do this.", 
    "So let&#39;s say we try to go and\nsolve this for the following", 
    "values of various parameters.", 
    "So let&#39;s assume that the input\nvoltage v is 1 volt.", 
    "Let&#39;s use r of 1 ohm.", 
    "Let&#39;s use the constant a to be a\n1/4 of an amp, and let&#39;s use", 
    "b as 1 volt inverse.", 
    "So those are the values\nthat I&#39;m going to use.", 
    "And for that set of values, I\nget vd equals 1 minus 1/4 e", 
    "raised to vd.", 
    "How do I get that?", 
    "So vd is 1.", 
    "I&#39;ve chosen r to be 1, a\nis 1/4, and b is a1.", 
    "And so this is what I get\non the right hand side.", 
    "OK, so I now need to go and\nsolve this equation here,", 
    "where vd equals 1 minus\n1/4 e to vd.", 
    "So any value of vd that\nsatisfies this", 
    "equation will work.", 
    "So one approach is to keep\ntrying various values of vd by", 
    "trial and error, and see if for\nsome value of vd that I", 
    "substitute here, if I get\nthe same value of vd on", 
    "the left hand side.", 
    "If I do, then that\nis an answer.", 
    "That&#39;s a trial and\nerror method.", 
    "I can be a bit more\nsophisticated about this and", 
    "do the following.", 
    "But before I do it, I just want\nto caution you that in", 
    "6002X, you&#39;re not responsible\nfor understanding and learning", 
    "about sophisticated numerical\ntechniques for analyzing long", 
    "linear equations.", 
    "So the basic approach\nthat I want to cover", 
    "here is simply this.", 
    "So what you can do\nis let me guess.", 
    "Let me guess at a value v being\none 1 volt, and see what", 
    "I get for vd.", 
    "And the basic idea is to find\nthe value that gives me the", 
    "same value for vd.", 
    "So fundamentally, what I&#39;m doing\nis I&#39;m finding what is", 
    "called a fixed point.", 
    "So fundamentally, I&#39;m trying\nto find a fixed", 
    "point for this equation.", 
    "So a value of vd on the right\nhand side should give me the", 
    "same value of vd on the\nleft hand side.", 
    "And if so, it must\nbe the answer.", 
    "So let me try 1 volt,\nand I get 0.3 volts.", 
    "So clearly 1 volt is\nnot the answer.", 
    "So I say OK, let me\ntry 0.32 volts.", 
    "And I plug 0.32 volts on this\nside, and what do I get for vd", 
    "on the right hand side?", 
    "So I plug 0.32 volts on the left\nhand side, I get the 0.65", 
    "for vd on the right hand side.", 
    "OK, I got 0.65 for this vd, so\nOK, let me try punching that", 
    "0.65 for this vd and\nsee what I get.", 
    "I get 0.52 for the vd on\nthe left hand side.", 
    "Let me punch that into the vd on\nthe left, what do I get for", 
    "vd on the right?", 
    "I get 0.58 volts for the\nvd on the right.", 
    "So let me plug that in, and I\nget 0.55 for the vd on the", 
    "left, and then I plug that\ninto the left, I get", 
    "0.56 for the right.", 
    "And then I plug that into the\nright, and I end up with 0.56", 
    "for the left as well.", 
    "So notice that I successively\nkept plugging in values for", 
    "vd, took the resulting value\nand plugged it in and kept", 
    "going till I came up with the\nvalue that yielded the same", 
    "value on both sides.", 
    "And so it appears\nthat vd equals", 
    "0.56 volts is a solution.", 
    "Now in general, this method\nthat I had of successively", 
    "using the same answer as input\nto drive the equation works in", 
    "some cases.", 
    "This has to do with the\nconvergence property of these", 
    "equations, and again, let&#39;s not\ngo too deep into numerical", 
    "techniques of this course,\nthat&#39;s not the", 
    "focus of this course.", 
    "So sometimes when you keep\nplugging these values, you may", 
    "not converge, it may start\ndiverging, but in this case,", 
    "it seems to converge.", 
    "But fundamentally, what I&#39;m\ntrying to do is apply trial", 
    "and error techniques to\nget the same value", 
    "of vd on both sides.", 
    "So for 0.56 volts for vd, I\ncan now plug that into my", 
    "equation id equals ae to the\nbvd, but I know a, I know b,", 
    "and I now know vd.", 
    "And by plugging in these\nnumbers, I get", 
    "id equals 0.44 amps.", 
    "There you have it, there&#39;s\nmy solution.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to use this\nsolution often as we go ahead.", 
    "So this method is the\nanalytical method.", 
    "In this method, we use the node\nmethod to write out the", 
    "equations for the circuit, and\nthen simply use the analytical", 
    "techniques to solve non-linear\nsimultaneous equations, and we", 
    "obtain the answer.",
