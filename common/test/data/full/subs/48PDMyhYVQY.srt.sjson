    "SPEAKER: OK, hope you had a chance to try this out in the", 
    "previous exercise.", 
    "Let me go ahead and do this for you.", 
    "Let me write down a few things that we know right away.", 
    "So by observation in the circuit, we know that since", 
    "I've connected V-minus to ground, V-minus is 0.", 
    "I know that V-out--", 
    "let me just write a little barrier here-- so V-out is", 
    "equal to A times V-plus minus V-minus.", 
    "And because V-minus is grounded,", 
    "this is simply AV-plus.", 
    "Or conversely, V-plus is simply V-out divided by A.", 
    "So what is this really saying here?", 
    "What this is saying is that the op amp", 
    "will arrange its feedback.", 
    "So in this op amp--", 
    "look at this feedback here-- this is saying that because of", 
    "the voltage divider in the feedback path, V-plus is going", 
    "to be such that it will be V-out divided by A. So", 
    "whatever V-out is, V-out divided by A is going to show", 
    "up at V-plus.", 
    "So we will use that in our analysis.", 
    "So in this case, let me go ahead and use the node method.", 
    "So according to the node method, let me go ahead and", 
    "write down the node voltages here.", 
    "So I'm going to figure out what V-plus is.", 
    "I know the voltage here.", 
    "This is V-in.", 
    "So this is V-in And the voltage out here is V-out.", 
    "And so V-out is a straight function of V-plus.", 
    "It is A times V-plus.", 
    "So really, the only goal here is try to figure", 
    "out what V-plus is.", 
    "So let me write down the node equations for the node with", 
    "voltage V-plus.", 
    "Let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "OK, so the current coined in the node method, the current", 
    "headed in the left direction from V-plus, is V-plus minus", 
    "V-in divided by R1.", 
    "I add to that the current headed from", 
    "V-plus to the right.", 
    "Remember, in the node method, we can add up the currents", 
    "leaving a node and set that to 0.", 
    "So the current headed in the right is V-plus minus V-out", 
    "divided by R2.", 
    "And that is equal to 0.", 
    "So the current in this direction is simply V-plus", 
    "minus V-out divided by R2.", 
    "And I set that equal to 0.", 
    "Now, given that V-plus is V-out divided by A, I can", 
    "replace V-plus with V-out.", 
    "So we know that V-plus equals V-out divided by A. So I can", 
    "replace V-plus.", 
    "Let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So I get V-out divided by A minus V-in divided by R1 plus", 
    "V-out divided by A minus V-out divided by R2.", 
    "And that is equal to 0.", 
    "So notice I now have an equation in V-out and V-in.", 
    "And the rest of it is simply algebra in order to get a nice", 
    "clean relationship between V-out and V-in.", 
    "So let me do that.", 
    "OK, what shall I do?", 
    "I see an A, an R1, and R2 in the denominator.", 
    "So let me multiply both sides of the equation by AR1 R2.", 
    "OK, let's see what that gives us.", 
    "If we multiply both by AR1 R2, let's see.", 
    "So out here, in the first term, R1 and A cancel out,", 
    "leaving R2.", 
    "So I get R2 V-out.", 
    "And then R1 cancels out.", 
    "So I get AR2 V-in.", 
    "Out here, AR2 cancels out.", 
    "So I get R1 V-out.", 
    "And here, R2 cancels out, leaving AR1 V-out.", 
    "And that is equal to 0.", 
    "OK, now let me collect the V-out and the V-in", 
    "terms. So I get V-out.", 
    "Let me stick that here.", 
    "So I get R2.", 
    "And I have another R1 here.", 
    "So I got this one, I got this one, and let me now", 
    "collect this one.", 
    "So I get minus AR1 V-out.", 
    "So I have all of that stuff.", 
    "Let me move V-in to the other side.", 
    "So I'm going to take V-in and move it to the other side.", 
    "And I'm going to get V-in times AR2.", 
    "Continuing with the analysis, let me move this whole thing", 
    "down and to the right.", 
    "So I end up with V-out all by its lonesome on", 
    "the left-hand side.", 
    "I get V-in AR2 out here divided by R2", 
    "plus R1 minus AR1.", 
    "OK, I'm almost, almost, almost done.", 
    "So now what I can do is I can divide both the numerator and", 
    "denominator by A, which will yield V-in times R2.", 
    "I divide the numerator by A, so A and A cancels out.", 
    "So I get R2.", 
    "And then, in the denominator, I get R2 divided by A plus R1", 
    "divided by A minus R1.", 
    "So now I can start making some approximations.", 
    "Since A is large--", 
    "so since A is very large, A tends to infinity--", 
    "usually it's about 10 to the sixth--", 
    "what I can do is I can cancel out R2 divided by A and R1", 
    "divided by A in relation to R1.", 
    "So what that gives me is it gives me V-out is simply minus", 
    "R2 divided by R1 V-in.", 
    "There I have it.", 
    "So as promised, V-out equals minus R2 divided by R1 V-in,", 
    "which is exactly the same as what you saw when and you had", 
    "negative feedback in this inverting op amp connection.", 
    "So this is all fine.", 
    "This is all fine.", 
    "But the problem with this is how do I explain what really", 
    "happened with the op amp?", 
    "Let me draw your attention back to the circuit in the top", 
    "right-hand corner of your screen.", 
    "Notice that a static analysis of this sort gave me the same", 
    "equation, V-out equals minus R2 divided by R1 times V-in,", 
    "as we had with negative feedback.", 
    "But clearly, when we did the little simulation by hand, we", 
    "found that if I perturbed V-out even ever so slightly,", 
    "if I perturbed it in the positive direction, the output", 
    "would ratchet up to Vs. And if I perturbed it to the negative", 
    "direction to begin with, the output would ratchet down to", 
    "minus Vs. So either way, it will either ratchet up or", 
    "ratchet down, depending on wherever", 
    "the noise hit initially.", 
    "And my analysis somehow does not capture that.", 
    "So in the next video, I'm going to show you a slightly", 
    "more interesting model for the op amp, which will attempt to", 
    "capture the time behavior of the op amp.", 
    "So let's get on with that in the next video."
