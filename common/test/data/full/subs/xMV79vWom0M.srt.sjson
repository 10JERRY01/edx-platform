    "SPEAKER : Now let's move on to second-order systems.", 
    "So far you looked at first-order systems that", 
    "contained a single energy storage", 
    "element such as a capacitor.", 
    "So a circuit containing a voltage source, a capacitor,", 
    "and a resistor was a first-order circuit.", 
    "Now we will look at second-order systems. So in", 
    "these circuits, you will have two independent", 
    "energy storage elements.", 
    "So for example, you might have a capacitor and an inductor,", 
    "or you might have two capacitors that are", 
    "independent of each other.", 
    "Now in such systems, we are going to get dynamics that are", 
    "governed by second-order differential equations, not", 
    "first-order differential equations.", 
    "So to study second-order systems, I encourage you to", 
    "review complex algebra, which is in", 
    "Appendix C of the textbook.", 
    "You need a little bit of that stuff for time domain", 
    "second-order systems that we would cover in", 
    "the next two sequences.", 
    "And then we will use a lot more of complex algebra in the", 
    "sequences for next week.", 
    "And in case you're wondering what this bridge is doing", 
    "here-- in case up my art is not all that good, this is a", 
    "bridge, after all.", 
    "This is a suspension bridge.", 
    "And in case you're wondering what this bridge is doing", 
    "here, well, I will keep you in suspense.", 
    "Haha.", 
    "That was a pun, a bit of a poor joke.", 
    "You will find out what's suspension bridges have to do", 
    "with second-order systems later on in the course, and", 
    "you will see some surprising, exciting stuff.", 
    "All right.", 
    "To motivate the study of second-order systems, let us", 
    "look at a very familiar situation, that of an inverter", 
    "driving another inverter.", 
    "If you saw this as a motivating example in our", 
    "first-order systems, it turns out that under certain", 
    "conditions, this is a perfectly good system to study", 
    "for second-order systems as well.", 
    "So let me draw out the equivalent circuits for these", 
    "two inverters.", 
    "So bear with me for a couple of seconds while I", 
    "painstakingly draw it out for you.", 
    "So let's have a five-volt supply, VS. I have a load", 
    "resistor, and in this case, let's assume two kilohms. And", 
    "I have my MOSFET, so this is my first inverter.", 
    "And let's say my MOSFET is driven by some input.", 
    "And this input is some sequence of ones and zeroes.", 
    "Let me call this node A.", 
    "This MOSFET drives a second inverter.", 
    "This inverter drives a second inverter.", 
    "Let me draw that inverter here.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "This is also two kilohms, and this is also five volts.", 
    "And here is where I take the output, C.", 
    "So this is my input A, my intermediate node B, and my", 
    "output C. So I'm going to connect my first inverter to", 
    "the second inverter input.", 
    "And in here, just to be clear, let me connect up the ground", 
    "nodes, just to show you the", 
    "connections very, very clearly.", 
    "So let me mark this node as B, and of course this node is", 
    "marked C.", 
    "Let me also draw out some of the parasitic capacitances and", 
    "so on that we see in this circuit.", 
    "The reason I called them parasitic is it's not", 
    "something I usually see, but it's something that appears", 
    "whether I like it or not.", 
    "And so here is my capacitor.", 
    "Let's say this capacitance models the gate-to-source", 
    "capacitance of the second MOSFET.", 
    "It may also include the capacitance of the wires", 
    "connecting the output of inverter A to the input of the", 
    "second inverter butter as well.", 
    "So all of that put together.", 
    "Let me just call that CGS.", 
    "There is my capacitor.", 
    "So here is where I show you the gate-to-source capacitance", 
    "of the MOSFET.", 
    "Let me mark these nodes with some colors, so as I draw them", 
    "out I can use some nice little colors to show them.", 
    "So let's mark this with yellow.", 
    "Let's mark the node B with the green.", 
    "And let's mark node C with purple.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "So I'm going to mark these nodes with these three colors", 
    "so that when we draw the waveforms, those will be", 
    "pretty clear.", 
    "So here is our circuit.", 
    "And this is our MOSFET inverter driving another", 
    "MOSFET inverter.", 
    "So now what I could do is I could look at what the", 
    "waveforms are going to look like at A, B, and C, and see", 
    "if they match our intuition.", 
    "So based on what we know so far, I could draw out the", 
    "waveforms for this little circuit.", 
    "So I'm going to plot the waveforms at A, and that is", 
    "going to be VA.", 
    "The waveform at B, that's going to be VB.", 
    "And the waveform at C, in purple, is going to be VC.", 
    "So let me start with the waveform at A,", 
    "and let me pick yellow.", 
    "So let's say the waveform at A is some square wave", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "0 to 5, back down to 0, and then I go up, and then back on", 
    "to 5 again, and then I keep going.", 
    "So that is my waveform at A.", 
    "OK, next let me plot the expected waveform at B. And", 
    "notice this little capacitor here, and let's say the RC", 
    "time constant here is pretty large.", 
    "So what I'm going to see at VB, the waveform at B-- we", 
    "called that VB--", 
    "is going to look something like this.", 
    "So as I apply a low voltage at VA, I'm going to get a high", 
    "voltage at VB.", 
    "And then when A jumps up to a high value, B", 
    "gets pulled down low.", 
    "So the B node gets pulled down low, and it goes down pretty", 
    "fast. And the reason it goes down pretty fast, as you will", 
    "see in this demo, is that the on resistance of the MOSFET is", 
    "very, very low.", 
    "So B will go down pretty nicely as you", 
    "expect, pretty quickly.", 
    "Then I go up here, and now when A rises again--", 
    "so when VA rises--", 
    "what happens?", 
    "I'm sorry, when VA falls.", 
    "So when VA falls here, the first time transistor is going", 
    "to shut off, and the node B needs to be pulled up to a", 
    "high value.", 
    "Now notice that the capacitor is initially charged to a low", 
    "value, CGS, and it needs to charge up through the", 
    "five-volt and the 2K resistor, and there's the CGS.", 
    "So in this case, let's assume it's a pretty large time", 
    "constant, and so what I expect is something like this.", 
    "I'm going to start off at 0, and I'm going to see some kind", 
    "of a rising waveform that looks like this.", 
    "Again, this is going to reflect some time constant.", 
    "Tau, the time constant for this, would be reflective of", 
    "two kilohms times CGS.", 
    "Let's assume it's a pretty large time constant.", 
    "Then when VA rises again, this is going to drop.", 
    "Because R on is very low, it's going to drop quickly.", 
    "And then it's going to continue like this.", 
    "So this is what you would expect.", 
    "No magic here.", 
    "Let me switch to purple for VC.", 
    "So now, because VB has risen slowly, what", 
    "does VC look like?", 
    "So VC will start off at 0, because VB is high.", 
    "And then it goes up to five volts.", 
    "And then it continues at five volts.", 
    "And then at this point, VB starts to rise.", 
    "At some point, VB is going to rise high enough to hit the", 
    "threshold value for the MOSFET at the second inverter.", 
    "And so because the MOSFET turns on, as the voltage at B", 
    "goes above the threshold value for the MOSFET whose input is", 
    "B, the output is going to fall.", 
    "So here, at some point, the MOSFET output, the second", 
    "inverter output, is going to fall.", 
    "And then I'm going to continue on down here.", 
    "And then, as the signal at B goes down, the output at C is", 
    "going to go up again.", 
    "This is what it's going to look like.", 
    "So this is what we know.", 
    "The bad thing that has happened here is--", 
    "notice that this delay is happening.", 
    "Because my green signal, the signal at B, rose slowly, it",
