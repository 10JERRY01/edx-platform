    "SPEAKER 1: So here's an example that I'm going to", 
    "pick, examples of the values.", 
    "So I've just cleaned up the diagram here for you.", 
    "Input voltage, vi of t.", 
    "It's an independent source, but it's time varying on my", 
    "resistor, R. And vc of t is the", 
    "voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "So I'm going to solve it for the following sets of", 
    "conditions.", 
    "First of all, I'm going to give you an initial condition", 
    "of the capacitor.", 
    "So I'm going to pick t0 to be 0.", 
    "So vc of 0 is v0.", 
    "I'm going to give you that, because I'm going to give you", 
    "an initial condition on the capacitor at time 0.", 
    "I'm also going to pick a very simple input source.", 
    "So v of t--", 
    "I'm just going to tell you it's a constant source, VI.", 
    "It's some constant value, VI.", 
    "Three volts, for example.", 
    "So that's my input.", 
    "It's a very simple set of conditions, and what I need to", 
    "do now is I need to go and solve the differential", 
    "equation that I developed earlier for the first order RC", 
    "circuit containing an independent source, a", 
    "resistor, and a capacitor in series.", 
    "And the equation was RC dvc dt, plus vc.", 
    "And that was equal to the input.", 
    "And in this case, I'm telling you that the input is VI.", 
    "Let me mark this equation as equation X, because I will be", 
    "referring to this a lot.", 
    "So stare at this for a few seconds.", 
    "Again, we're going to solve this differential equation,", 
    "which governs the behavior of the circuit for an initial", 
    "condition at time t equals 0, given by v0.", 
    "And I'm telling you that the input voltage is a", 
    "constant DC value, VI.", 
    "So from now on, the next step is purely math.", 
    "OK?", 
    "I'm just going to take this differential equation and", 
    "solve it for the given initial condition, and", 
    "the given drive voltage.", 
    "And it's a purely mathematical activity of solving a", 
    "first-order differential equation.", 
    "I'm going to walk you through the steps and show you a", 
    "simple, straightforward method of doing the solution.", 
    "So the method that I'm going to use to solve the", 
    "differential equation will be the method of homogeneous in", 
    "particular solutions.", 
    "To summarize, my differential equation is here.", 
    "It's marked with the X, as I showed you earlier.", 
    "RC dvc dt plus vc equals VI.", 
    "This is my differential equation.", 
    "I'm going to solve it for input drive, vi of t equals", 
    "capital V, capital I. And for an initial condition of the", 
    "capacitor at time t equals 0, given by v0.", 
    "So it's all going to be math [INAUDIBLE] your head.", 
    "But one thing I want to point out is that oftentimes, people", 
    "get a little bit nervous about looking at different", 
    "equations, but they're just not a big deal.", 
    "They're actually very easy.", 
    "And I will show you that most of what solving differential", 
    "equations involves is really guesswork.", 
    "It's mostly guess and check, is what solving differential", 
    "equations involves.", 
    "And in this course, for all the differential equations you", 
    "will see, we will use exactly one method of solving them,", 
    "and the method will be the method of homogeneous and", 
    "particular solutions.", 
    "Whether it's first order or second order differential", 
    "equations, we will use just this method, and I will walk", 
    "you through exactly how to do the solution in a very step by", 
    "step manner.", 
    "And it is actually very simple.", 
    "So solving a differential equation by the method of", 
    "homogeneous and particular solutions", 
    "involves these steps.", 
    "The first step is to find what we call", 
    "the particular solution.", 
    "The second step, hey, what a surprise, is to solve the", 
    "homogeneous equation, find the homogeneous solution.", 
    "And the third step will be to find the total solution.", 
    "And the total solution will be the sum of the particular and", 
    "homogeneous solutions.", 
    "So we'll form the particular solution, find the homogeneous", 
    "solution, sum them up to get the total solution.", 
    "And then what we'll do is I will use the initial", 
    "conditions to solve for the remaining constants that I may", 
    "not have discovered in the lab.", 
    "It's a three-step problem.", 
    "Particular, homogeneous, sum them up, and find the", 
    "constants through initial conditions.", 
    "So in terms of notation, I'm going to say that I need to", 
    "find vc of t.", 
    "So vc of t will be given by the sum of the particular and", 
    "homogeneous solutions.", 
    "So I'm going to call the homogeneous", 
    "solution vcH of t--", 
    "H for homogeneous--", 
    "and vcp of t for the particular solution.", 
    "So this will be my total solution, this will be my", 
    "homogeneous solution, and this will be", 
    "my particular solution.", 
    "So vc of t will be equal to the homogeneous plus the", 
    "particular solutions, and I sum them up, and then use the", 
    "initial conditions to find any remaining constants that", 
    "haven't developed here.", 
    "Now I want to tell you again what I said earlier, which is", 
    "that solving differential equations is", 
    "actually really easy.", 
    "They are much maligned.", 
    "Solving them is very easy, and it", 
    "commonly involves guesswork.", 
    "So solution involves guesswork, generally, and", 
    "applying patterns.", 
    "So the funny part of differential equations, again,", 
    "is that you look at the equation and then you say,", 
    "aha, I know that that kind of equation has", 
    "the following solution.", 
    "So you guess the solution of that form, and then you go", 
    "ahead and do it.", 
    "It's really, really not hard.", 
    "It's very simple, and involves, generally,", 
    "guesswork, at least in 600.2x.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So let's move on to solving our equation here, X, using", 
    "these three steps.", 
    "And then let's see what the answer looks like."
