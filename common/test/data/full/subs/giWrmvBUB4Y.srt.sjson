    "SPEAKER: Continuing with our study of the ideal linear", 
    "inductor, now let me go ahead and start by drawing the", 
    "electrical symbol for the inductor with inductance L,", 
    "current i flowing through it, and voltage v across this", 
    "two-terminal element.", 
    "And also recall we said lambda, which was the total", 
    "flux linked with all the turns, was given by the", 
    "inductance times the current.", 
    "And we assume that this is linear in that as the current", 
    "increases, or as the flux density increases at various", 
    "points, the inductance does not change.", 
    "So the inductance is--", 
    "L is a constant.", 
    "So inductors are linear.", 
    "Clearly evidence by the linear relationship", 
    "between lambda and i.", 
    "And you can also verify this for yourself, much as we did", 
    "with capacitors that they satisfy the properties of", 
    "homogeneity and superposition.", 
    "The next step we can go ahead and start writing down the", 
    "relationship between the voltage and current for the", 
    "inductor, and let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So the voltage across the inductor v is given by d", 
    "lambda by dt.", 
    "That is the rate of change of flux with respect to time is", 
    "the voltage across the inductor.", 
    "And this comes straight from Maxwell's equations.", 
    "So you recall when we did Maxwell's equations, we looked", 
    "at d phi B by dt being the rate of", 
    "change of magnetic flux.", 
    "Phi B there related to the flux linked to one loop.", 
    "And here, lambda really is the flux linked to all the terms", 
    "of the wire.", 
    "And so lambda and phi B are closely related.", 
    "So lambda is the total flux linked with all the", 
    "turns of the coil.", 
    "So d lambda by dt is equal to the", 
    "voltage across the inductor.", 
    "And I can also write down in terms of the current where", 
    "lambda is given by Li.", 
    "So dLi by dt from here.", 
    "Then we make our usual 6.002x assumption.", 
    "And in this assumption, we assume that the inductors are", 
    "time-invariant.", 
    "So we said L is time-invariant.", 
    "And what that does is that if L doesn't change with respect", 
    "to time, then we can pull it out of this differentiation", 
    "here, and we can simply write down di dt.", 
    "L times di dt.", 
    "OK, so this is a 6.002x assumption.", 
    "And the inductors you will see in this course are going to be", 
    "time-invariant.", 
    "So really we're talking about linear time-invariant", 
    "inductors in 6.002x.", 
    "So I L di by dt for the inductor.", 
    "I can also write down the current by turning the", 
    "differentiation into integration here.", 
    "So i is the integral of v divide by L. So the integral 1", 
    "by L of v dt.", 
    "And this goes from minus infinity to t, much like it", 
    "did for capacitors.", 
    "So again here, you can note the dual relationship between", 
    "the inductor and capacitor.", 
    "And let me go ahead and write down the corresponding items", 
    "that you had for the capacitor in green for your reference.", 
    "Recall for the inductor, v is equal to L di dt.", 
    "And for the capacitor, let me write that down", 
    "here, recall c--", 
    "I'm sorry, the current i was equal to c dv dt.", 
    "OK, not surprising at all that these two are", 
    "duals of each other.", 
    "Notice that for the inductor, the voltage", 
    "here became a current.", 
    "And where I have a L, I now have a c.", 
    "And then where I have di dt, I have a dv dt.", 
    "So you notice the amazing dual relationship where inductors", 
    "and capacitors are such that there's the duality between", 
    "the voltages and currents.", 
    "And we get very similar relationships for currents", 
    "with inductors where the relationships for capacitors", 
    "are with the voltage, for instance.", 
    "We saw the same kind of relationship between the", 
    "voltage and the current for the capacitor in terms of the", 
    "integration as well.", 
    "So I really want you to note this duality between inductor", 
    "and capacitor.", 
    "And you can actually use it to your advantage to dramatically", 
    "simplifying a lot of circuits.", 
    "So if you know how a capacitor would behave under certain", 
    "conditions by using duality, you can then very quickly", 
    "derive how an inductor would behave.", 
    "And in fact, we will use that method to quickly analyze some", 
    "inductor circuits."
