    "SPEAKER 1: So before we go ahead and do an example LC", 
    "circuit of a particular type, let me very quickly summarize", 
    "the method that we went through to solve our second", 
    "order differential equation.", 
    "So let me very quickly summarize this for you.", 
    "So the overall structure of the method had", 
    "the following steps.", 
    "The steps we adopted was in terms of solving the whole", 
    "process, we wrote down the differential equation in our", 
    "first step.", 
    "And we wrote down the differential equation for the", 
    "circuit by applying the node method.", 
    "Then we found a particular solution vP by", 
    "guessing at a solution.", 
    "And then we found the homogeneous solution vH.", 
    "To find the homogeneous solution, I used four steps.", 
    "So in the first step, I again guessed at a solution of the", 
    "form Ae raised to sd.", 
    "More guesswork.", 
    "I guessed at a vP, and I guessed at a solution of the", 
    "form Ae raised to sd for the homogeneous solution.", 
    "Then I obtained the characteristic equation.", 
    "And you recall, the characteristic equation was LC", 
    "s squared plus 1 was equal to 0.", 
    "So, following that, I solved for the roots of the equation", 
    "to the second order equation.", 
    "LC s squared has two roots, and so I solved for the two", 
    "roots, s1 and s2.", 
    "Then I formed vH by summing up the two terms. A1 e raised to", 
    "s 1t plus A2 e raised to s 2t.", 
    "So I got the vH solution by summing up the two components", 
    "that I obtained from the two roots.", 
    "Then in the final step, I obtained the total solution.", 
    "Recall that this part of the solution here was just a", 
    "homogeneous solution.", 
    "Then I obtained the total solution by summing up the", 
    "particular and the homogeneous solutions.", 
    "And then I solve for the remaining constants using the", 
    "initial conditions.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And the initial conditions I chose for the example I did", 
    "was v of 0 was 0, and the current at that time t equal", 
    "to 0 through the inductor was also 0.", 
    "So that's a quick summary of the method we adopted to solve", 
    "these differential equations.", 
    "And it's pretty similar to the method we had gone through for", 
    "solving first order equations.", 
    "So we use the same method of particular and homogeneous", 
    "solutions in order to solve the differential", 
    "equations in 6.002X.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Next I'd like to go into the details of an example, and see", 
    "how things change when I make some variations in my state", 
    "values and inputs."
