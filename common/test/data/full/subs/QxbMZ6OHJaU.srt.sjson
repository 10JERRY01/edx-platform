    "SPEAKER 1: Next, let's look at a really, really fun case.", 
    "OK?", 
    "This is the underdamped case where alpha is", 
    "less than omega naught.", 
    "OK?", 
    "It is this case here.", 
    "Now, I caution you, I'm going to be doing a bunch of grubby", 
    "math for the next 10 or 15 minutes.", 
    "So follow me along.", 
    "I will go pretty fast. You don't have to really get every", 
    "little detail of what I'm doing.", 
    "I think what would be important is the kind of", 
    "insights we're going to get at the very end, and the basic", 
    "results that we get.", 
    "All right?", 
    "So let's get started.", 
    "So, in this case, I'm telling you that in this e raised to", 
    "square root of alpha squared minus omega naught squared,", 
    "that alpha is less than omega naught.", 
    "So if alpha is less than omega naught, then I'm going to have", 
    "a negative number under the square root sign.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Since I have a negative number under the square root sign, I", 
    "can equivalently write that as e raised to j square root of", 
    "omega naught squared minus alpha squared.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Is that clear?", 
    "Let me spend a couple more seconds on this.", 
    "So alpha is less than omega naught, right?", 
    "So this is a negative number.", 
    "So I would say this is minus 1 times omega", 
    "naught minus alpha squared.", 
    "So I'm going to take the square root of", 
    "minus 1, which is j.", 
    "So j is the square root of minus 1.", 
    "And I'm going to pull j outside.", 
    "I've pulled j outside, and I left omega naught squared", 
    "minus alpha squared inside the square root sign.", 
    "So I hope you followed what I did there.", 
    "So now I can go ahead and write down v of t, with this", 
    "little transformation for the case where alpha is less than", 
    "omega naught.", 
    "So v of t is VI--", 
    "so I'm working on this little thing here--", 
    "A1 doesn't change, e raised to minus alpha t", 
    "doesn't change either.", 
    "However, this little part here, this", 
    "changes quite a bit.", 
    "So here I've pulled out j, and I'm going to write this as", 
    "omega naught squared minus alpha squared times t plus A2", 
    "e raised to minus alpha t e raised to minus j omega naught", 
    "squared minus alpha squared times t.", 
    "So I get minus j square root of omega naught squared minus", 
    "alpha squared times t.", 
    "Let's do the following.", 
    "There's a bunch of stuff here.", 
    "Let me clean this up a little bit.", 
    "Let me assume--", 
    "let me write this down here.", 
    "I'm seeing a lot of this omega naught minus alpha squared, so", 
    "let's do this.", 
    "Let's write this down.", 
    "Let's pick an omega d.", 
    "And so omega d is omega naught squared minus alpha squared.", 
    "By using that notation for omega naught squared minus", 
    "alpha squared, I can clean things up quite a bit.", 
    "So VI plus A1 e raised to minus alpha t times e raised", 
    "to j omega dt plus a to e raised to minus alpha t e", 
    "raised to minus j omega dt.", 
    "That's cleaned things up quite a bit by picking omega d", 
    "equals omega naught squared minus alpha squared.", 
    "And for reasons that you will find out soon, omega d is", 
    "called the damped natural frequency of the circuit.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So omega d is called the damped natural frequency.", 
    "And in case you're wondering what omega naught is called,", 
    "omega naught is called the undamped--", 
    "surprise, surprise--", 
    "natural frequency.", 
    "It is also called the undamped resonant frequency.", 
    "So omega d and omega naught, where omega d has a slightly", 
    "lower value than omega naught, because I'm subtracting omega", 
    "naught squared minus alpha squared and taking the square", 
    "root of that.", 
    "So I've rewritten my equation in terms of omega d in place", 
    "of square root of omega naught squared minus alpha squared.", 
    "But I do see a problem here.", 
    "I have a j here and a minus j here.", 
    "And so I need to do something about it.", 
    "So here I am going to make a little leap, and I want you to", 
    "hold on to me while I make a jump here.", 
    "So notice that vt is real.", 
    "vt is real.", 
    "So if vt is real, my right hand side must be real.", 
    "So because of this my right hand side must also be real.", 
    "But I have this e to the j omega t and e to the", 
    "minus j omega t.", 
    "And we know, from all this relation, the following.", 
    "We know that e to the j omega dt is equal to cosine of omega", 
    "dt plus j sine of omega dt.", 
    "So notice that I have this j thing floating around.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So I have some imaginary stuff floating around.", 
    "But I know that my left hand side is real.", 
    "OK, so what insight can you apply here?", 
    "What insight can you apply here to simplify our lives a", 
    "little bit?", 
    "So if you notice here, this is real.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So that's good.", 
    "So e to the minus alpha t is real, and we have e to the", 
    "minus alpha t here as well.", 
    "So let me underline the real parts with green stuff.", 
    "So this is real and this is real.", 
    "Now, notice that e to the j omega t and e to the minus j", 
    "omega t I know are here, but the good news is that they are", 
    "complex conjugates of each other.", 
    "I know that e to the minus j omega dt, that is", 
    "cosine minus j sine.", 
    "e to the j omega dt and e to the minus j omega dt are", 
    "complex conjugates of each other.", 
    "OK, so there's a likelihood that, as I add things up, the", 
    "imaginary parts will cancel out giving me a real number.", 
    "Now it turns out that, given that these two are complex", 
    "conjugates of each other, it turns out the only way that I", 
    "can get a real number out of it is if A1 and A2 are complex", 
    "conjugates of each other.", 
    "So A1 and A2 must be complex conjugates of", 
    "each other as well.", 
    "And, by the way, if you went and did the whole math and", 
    "used initial conditions and all that stuff, that's how it", 
    "would come out, because the left hand side is real.", 
    "But using this intuition, since we know that A1 and A2", 
    "must be complex conjugates of each other, and that the", 
    "answer must come out to be real, what I can do here is", 
    "just directly write down the form of the final expression", 
    "after we massage all the complex conjugates around.", 
    "The form of this final expression must be", 
    "something like this.", 
    "I see a VI there, plus notice that I have these cosines and", 
    "sines floating around, and if A1 and A2 are complex", 
    "conjugates of each other, the final expression will be some", 
    "constant K1 times e raised to minus alpha t, times cosine of", 
    "omega dt plus some other constant K2 times e raised to", 
    "minus alpha t times sine omega dt.", 
    "All right?", 
    "So I made a leap here, and I didn't want to go through a", 
    "bunch of grubby math, so this is the leap that I took.", 
    "And very quickly, again, the leap I took was that, since", 
    "the left hand side was real, my right hand side also had to", 
    "come out to be real.", 
    "And since e to the j omega dt was a complex conjugate of e", 
    "to the minus j omega dt, I argued that A1 and A2 must", 
    "also be complex conjugates of each other, otherwise I would", 
    "not get a real number on the right hand side.", 
    "OK, so given that, I assumed here that my final solution", 
    "will be of the form VI plus K1 e raised to minus alpha t", 
    "cosine and the sine component in the other expression.", 
    "OK, so let's now go ahead and find the initial conditions,", 
    "given this form of the solution.", 
    "By the way, if you don't believe this is true, you're", 
    "welcome to take this more complicated expression and go", 
    "and find out the constants for the initial", 
    "conditions and so on.", 
    "You'll have a bit more grubby math to go through, but you", 
    "will end up in the same place."
