    "ANANT AGARWAL: What I'd like to do next is to show you a", 
    "demo, but before I show you a demo, I always found it", 
    "strange that I have a step input and then I have two", 
    "little elements, and how can I get a sine", 
    "coming out of the output?", 
    "OK, I'd like to get some intuition as to why do things", 
    "behave the way they are.", 
    "I could go and pray and try to find out.", 
    "But let me give you some very basic insight as to why this", 
    "behaves the way it does.", 
    "So let me draw the circuit for you here.", 
    "And this is my inductor L and capacitor C. And remember,", 
    "this is V. OK, let me just walk you through what's", 
    "happening there, and get you to understand this.", 
    "Now, you've seen sines occur before, if you go and write", 
    "down the equation of motion of a pendulum.", 
    "OK, you have a pendulum, you move it to one side, let go.", 
    "It is also governed by sinusoidal characteristics,", 
    "and you'll find that the equation governing its motion", 
    "is very much of the same form.", 
    "And you get the sinusoid where you have energy that is", 
    "sloshing back and forth between maximum potential", 
    "energy to maximum kinetic energy, and zero potential", 
    "energy back to maximum potential", 
    "energy, zero kinetic.", 
    "OK, so it's energy sloshing back and forth.", 
    "Same way here.", 
    "Capacitors and inductors store energy, and let's walk through", 
    "and see what happens.", 
    "So we start off with both of them having a stage zero--", 
    "zero current, zero voltage.", 
    "So, apply a step here.", 
    "Boom.", 
    "The step comes instantaneously to VI.", 
    "And notice that the capacitor voltage cannot change", 
    "instantly, unless there's an infinite pulse of a sort.", 
    "So this guy cannot change instantly, and so its voltage", 
    "starts off being zero.", 
    "So the entire voltage here--", 
    "KVL must be true, no matter what.", 
    "Absolute fundamental principles", 
    "from Maxwell's equations.", 
    "So KVL must hold, which means that the entire voltage VI", 
    "must appear across the inductor.", 
    "So I put a big voltage across the inductor, its current", 
    "begins to build up.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "So, a voltage across the inductor, its current begins", 
    "to build up.", 
    "As its current begins to build up, that current must flow", 
    "through the capacitor, too.", 
    "And as current flows through the capacitor, it is", 
    "depositing charge into the capacitor.", 
    "So as the capacitor begins to get charge deposited on it,", 
    "its voltage begins to rise.", 
    "So let's see what happens here.", 
    "So its voltage keeps rising.", 
    "At some point, the voltage on the capacitor is equal to VI.", 
    "But then VI equals this VI here.", 
    "So when the two become VI, the inductor has zero", 
    "volts across it.", 
    "So there's no longer a potential difference that's", 
    "increasing the current in that direction.", 
    "OK, so at that point, at pi divided by 2, I have some", 
    "current going through the inductor.", 
    "So there's no longer a pressure that is forcing more", 
    "current through the inductor, because this", 
    "voltage reaches VI.", 
    "But remember, capacitors like to sit", 
    "around holding voltages.", 
    "Just remember that demo.", 
    "That rinky-dink capacitor sat there", 
    "stubbornly holding its voltage.", 
    "And had a huge spark toward the end.", 
    "It just sat there holding its voltage.", 
    "In the same manner, inductors love to sit", 
    "around holding a current.", 
    "They will do whatever they can to keep the current going", 
    "through them.", 
    "So it's got the current going through, and few forces on", 
    "earth can change that.", 
    "And so, therefore, even though the capacitor voltage is VI,", 
    "and the voltage dropped across the inductor is zero, it still", 
    "keeps supplying the current.", 
    "It's got the current.", 
    "It's got inertia.", 
    "It keeps going.", 
    "It's like a runaway train.", 
    "You may not be pushing the train from the back, but once", 
    "it's running, it's got kinetic energy.", 
    "It's going to run no matter what, at least", 
    "for some more time.", 
    "Even if you take away the force on the train.", 
    "So I've taken away the force on the--", 
    "punching more current through.", 
    "But it's got kinetic energy.", 
    "It's got current flowing through it, and so it's going", 
    "to continue to supply current.", 
    "Because it continues to supply current, the capacitor voltage", 
    "keeps increasing.", 
    "This is a subtle insight which is absolutely spectacular,", 
    "that with zero volts across it, it still keeps pumping", 
    "that current.", 
    "Capacitor voltage has gone up, and guess what?", 
    "The voltage on this side is higher now!", 
    "But this guy's still pumping a current.", 
    "Man, I've been born to do this.", 
    "I shall pump a current.", 
    "However, because the voltage has now gone up here,", 
    "gradually the current begins to diminish.", 
    "But as far as the capacitor's concerned, you pump a current", 
    "into me, my voltage goes up.", 
    "At some point, like a runaway train, it comes to a halt.", 
    "So current for that capacitor train now goes to zero, and", 
    "the capacitor voltage reaches 2VI.", 
    "So this is at 2VI now, and this is at VI.", 
    "So now, the situation is not in equilibrium.", 
    "At this point, there's zero current through", 
    "it, but guess what?", 
    "I have a VI pumping in this direction now.", 
    "I have the same VI pumping in this direction.", 
    "So guess what?", 
    "Its current must now build up in this direction.", 
    "Its current begins to build up in that direction.", 
    "So that begins to discharge the capacitor, and the", 
    "capacitor then goes onto a negative--", 
    "or rather, the current goes onto a maximum negative", 
    "current, and this process continues.", 
    "So what you're seeing here is energy sloshing back and forth", 
    "between the two, and that's kind of a key.", 
    "I'll just quickly put up a demo that you can watch as", 
    "you're walking out.", 
    "So in the step input, notice the green is the voltage", 
    "across the capacitor and the orange is the current through", 
    "the capacitor."
