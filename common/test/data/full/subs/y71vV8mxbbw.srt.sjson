    "SPEAKER 1: So let me jump right into the final step, and", 
    "the final step is to find the total solution.", 
    "And again, now on the right-hand side, I show you", 
    "the equations.", 
    "And for your reference, I also have denoted the particular", 
    "solution, VCP, and I've also denoted the homogeneous", 
    "solution, Ae raised to minus t divided by RC, where RC is the", 
    "time constant.", 
    "OK, we'll see why it's called--", 
    "why we call it the time constant, when we look at some", 
    "graphs and plots of what the solution looks like.", 
    "OK, so the total solution is VC.", 
    "And we are told that VC is the sum of the particular solution", 
    "and the homogeneous solution, according to the method of", 
    "homogeneous and particular solutions.", 
    "So I'm simply following these three algorithmic steps.", 
    "And so let me go ahead and do the addition here of the", 
    "particular and homogeneous solutions.", 
    "So the particular solution is VI, and the homogeneous", 
    "solution is Ae raised to minus 1 by RC times t.", 
    "And that's my total solution.", 
    "And in the solution, I know pretty much everything except", 
    "for this constant, A. So I need to go figure that out.", 
    "So in the solution method, I need to go find the remaining", 
    "unknowns from initial conditions.", 
    "All right.", 
    "And the remaining unknown here is simply A. And what was the", 
    "initial condition again?", 
    "Well, I was given that VC, my capacitor voltage, was equal", 
    "to V 0 at time t, equal to 0.", 
    "But there, recall I was given this.", 
    "I was told that at time t equals 0, VC equals V 0.", 
    "So using that initial condition, I should be able to", 
    "find my unknowns and the sum of the particular and", 
    "homogeneous solutions.", 
    "So, if I go ahead and substitute the initial", 
    "conditions, clearly my solution has to be valid when", 
    "time starts out as 0, for the given initial condition.", 
    "So I'm told that VC is 0.", 
    "And so, at time t equals 0, so we're substituting in VC", 
    "equals V 0.", 
    "OK, I get V 0 equals VI plus Ae raised to minus RC times t.", 
    "And if t is 0, then that whole thing becomes 1.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "By substituting in t equals t0, I get this whole thing", 
    "becoming just A. So by substituting in VC at V equals", 
    "0, I get this.", 
    "So I get this by substituting in VC equals V 0, for time t", 
    "equals 0 in this equation here.", 
    "So I can now very quickly find A, and A is", 
    "simply V 0 minus VI.", 
    "And I'm pretty much done.", 
    "So therefore, in that same equation, from there I", 
    "substitute for A and I get VC equals VI plus V 0 minus VI", 
    "times e raised to minus 1 by RC times t.", 
    "So that is my solution to the first order", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "Notice that this is the voltage, and to complete the", 
    "note better, recall we can find each of the element", 
    "branch current symbol--", 
    "branch current-- by taking the voltage", 
    "across each of the elements.", 
    "And so easily, I can find iC.", 
    "The iC is simply the current through the capacitor.", 
    "Here, recall the little circuit that I had.", 
    "I had my voltage, Vi; and I had my resistor, R; and I had", 
    "my capacitor--", 
    "this was my ground.", 
    "This was VC.", 
    "And so, iC is simply C dVc dt.", 
    "So iC is simply C dVc dt.", 
    "And so, taking the derivative, iC being C dVc dt.", 
    "So the derivative of VI is 0, and the derivative of this", 
    "piece is simply minus 1 by RC.", 
    "So it is a C up here.", 
    "So minus 1 by RC simply results in 1 by R. And then I", 
    "get V 0 minus VI, and I get e to the minus RC times t.", 
    "So all I've done here is simply taken", 
    "the derivative of--", 
    "with respect to t--", 
    "dVc dt, and multiplied by C. And this is what I get for the", 
    "capacitor current.", 
    "So that is the complete solution of my", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "OK, so pretty straightforward.", 
    "I followed three steps.", 
    "In the first step, I found the particular solution by", 
    "guessing at a solution, VC equals VI.", 
    "Second step, I found the homogeneous solution when I", 
    "set the drive to 0.", 
    "And I assumed the solution of the form Ae raised to st , and", 
    "figured out what s was.", 
    "And then, finally, I found the total solution by adding up", 
    "the particular and homogeneous solutions, and by finding the", 
    "unknown constants by substituting in the values of", 
    "the initial conditions at the given instant in time.", 
    "So there is my solution.", 
    "So as a next step, I'm going to go and plot some examples", 
    "out to show you what these look like when", 
    "sketched out on a graph."
