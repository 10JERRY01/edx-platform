    "SPEAKER: OK, so I've written things a", 
    "little cleanly for you.", 
    "So where v-plus is gamma-plus v0, v-minus is gamma-minus v0.", 
    "This is the differential equation I've written up", 
    "cleanly for you.", 
    "And I'm assuming that I have a noise injected into the", 
    "system, such that v0 of 0 is equal to K.", 
    "OK, let me clean up my differential", 
    "equation a little bit.", 
    "And what I'll do is let me multiply both sides of this", 
    "equation by A divided by RC.", 
    "And let me move the gamma-plus minus gamma-minus term to the", 
    "left-hand side so I collect all the terms in v0.", 
    "So multiplying by A divided by RC, I get dv0 by dt.", 
    "I'm multiplying.", 
    "So I multiply out by A divided by RC.", 
    "And I get dv0 by dt plus.", 
    "So I have v0 divided by A. And I multiply out by", 
    "A divided by RC.", 
    "I get v0 divided by RC.", 
    "So I'm going to collect all the v0 terms here.", 
    "So my first term is related to v0 divided by A. And when I", 
    "multiply that out by A divided by RC, I get 1 by RC.", 
    "Then I have the second term here.", 
    "So this term here on the right-hand side is gamma-plus", 
    "minus gamma-minus times v0.", 
    "When I move it to the left-hand side and multiply", 
    "that by A divided by RC, I get A divided by RC.", 
    "And when I move gamma-plus minus gamma-minus to the", 
    "left-hand side, I get gamma-minus minus gamma-plus.", 
    "I just reverse the signs, and that's what I get.", 
    "And that is equal to 0.", 
    "So let me very quickly review what I did here,", 
    "from here to here.", 
    "Bottom line, it is simply algebraic grunge, nothing", 
    "conceptual.", 
    "I multiplied both sides by A divided by RC.", 
    "And I moved gamma-plus minus gamma-minus times v0 to the", 
    "left-hand side and collected up terms in v0.", 
    "Nothing fancy.", 
    "All right, what I'm going to do next is make some", 
    "approximations and simplify things.", 
    "Notice that I have A divided by RC, where A is large.", 
    "So I'm going to neglect 1 by RC.", 
    "And I'm going to neglect that because A divided by RC is", 
    "much bigger than 1 divided by RC.", 
    "So I neglect 1 divided by RC.", 
    "What am I left with?", 
    "So dv0 by dt plus A divided by RC gamma-minus minus", 
    "gamma-plus v0 equals 0.", 
    "Notice that this term here, recall from the solutions that", 
    "we did for first order circuits, this guy here has", 
    "units of time inverse.", 
    "And that is because, notice that I have", 
    "dv0 by dt out here.", 
    "And this is v0.", 
    "So therefore, to keep the units consistent, this A", 
    "divided by RC times gamma-minus minus gamma-plus", 
    "must have units of time inverse, so that v0 times that", 
    "will have the same units as dv0 by dt.", 
    "So to simplify things, why don't I just go ahead and call", 
    "that T. OK, I'm just going to go ahead and call that T. Oh,", 
    "you know what?", 
    "I have to be a little bit more careful.", 
    "Why don't I say that T--", 
    "it's inverse T--", 
    "so why don't I say that T is equal to the inverse of that.", 
    "So it's RC divided by A times gamma-minus minus gamma-plus.", 
    "That is T. I'm going to replace that chunk.", 
    "RC divided by A divided by gamma-minus minus gamma-plus,", 
    "I'm going to call that t to reflect the fact that it has", 
    "time units.", 
    "So therefore, my equation simply becomes dv0 by dt plus", 
    "v0 divided by T is equal to 0, where T is", 
    "given by this quantity.", 
    "OK, and recall, I now need to solve this differential", 
    "equation given the initial condition v0 of 0 is equal to", 
    "K, where K is a small initial perturbation.", 
    "So by now, you are all experts in solving", 
    "differential equations.", 
    "Here, there is only an initial condition.", 
    "So this is a 0 input response.", 
    "My input is 0.", 
    "So it's a ZIR.", 
    "And we know I can write down the solution to this very", 
    "quickly by inspection.", 
    "So I'm not going to go through the whole method.", 
    "You should be experts at this by now.", 
    "So my solution to this equation is--", 
    "you want to take a crack at it yourself?", 
    "So why don't you pause me and write down the solution", 
    "yourselves.", 
    "And then I'll write it down for you.", 
    "So the solution is v0 equals K e to the minus t divided by", 
    "capital T. And you can confirm it by substituting the", 
    "solution into the equation.", 
    "And you can confirm for yourselves that this does", 
    "indeed solve the differential equation, and it also meets", 
    "the initial condition.", 
    "Notice that when time is equal to 0--", 
    "so when t is equal to 0, correctly, v0 is equal to K.", 
    "OK, so my initial condition is also met by the solution.", 
    "So I'm all set with that.", 
    "And as a next step, I'd like to understand what is really", 
    "going on here.", 
    "Let me poke about at v0 equals K e raised to minus t by", 
    "capital T, where capital T is given by this, which, in turn,", 
    "is related to gamma-minus minus gamma-plus.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is understand the behavior of", 
    "this little equation in the dynamics of the system as", 
    "gamma-minus minus gamma-plus changes so that you have more", 
    "positive feedback or less positive feedback in relation", 
    "to negative feedback.", 
    "This is going to be fun."
