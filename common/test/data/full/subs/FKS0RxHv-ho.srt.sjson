    "SPEAKER 1: Let&#39;s now take a\ncircuit view of the small", 
    "signal model.", 
    "And what will be amazing is that\nwe&#39;ll put all the math", 
    "aside and be able to do\nthings in a really,", 
    "really simple manner.", 
    "Keep these things in mind.", 
    "Our basic circuit was a voltage\nsource with an input,", 
    "VI, connected across our LED\nhypothetical device.", 
    "And the relevant equations,\nwhere VD equals AEVBD for the", 
    "total variable, this was an\noperating point equation, and", 
    "this was the small\nsignal equation.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So let&#39;s now draw two\nkinds of circuits.", 
    "We can draw a large signal\ncircuit and a", 
    "small signal circuit.", 
    "The basic idea is we use math\nto create and write down the", 
    "logical equation, and then we\nuse Taylor&#39;s expansion to", 
    "write down the small\nsignal expression.", 
    "You know, that can be very,\nvery hard to do for some", 
    "large, complicated circuits.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to show you a\ncircuit technique that uses", 
    "circuit analysis to directly\nwrite these", 
    "down almost by expansion.", 
    "And to do so, in order to\ncreate the large signal", 
    "equation, I&#39;m just going\nto write down the", 
    "large signal circuit.", 
    "And to write down the small\nsignal equation, I&#39;m going to", 
    "write down the small\nsignal circuit.", 
    "Pretty obvious.", 
    "So the large signal circuit\nsimply takes my circuit and", 
    "replaces the various sources\nwith their DC bias values.", 
    "So in this case, I have\nmy LED device.", 
    "And what I&#39;m going to do is\nreplace the input with its", 
    "large signal equivalent.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to get a VI\nat the input here.", 
    "And for the device itself, I\nwant to get its bias values at", 
    "the output.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to get ID\nand VD at the output.", 
    "So my large signal equation\ncan be derived", 
    "from the device equation.", 
    "ID is given by ae\nraised to bVD.", 
    "So writing down the large signal\nequation typically", 
    "requires solving a nonlinear\ncircuit.", 
    "In this case, I could write\nthat down by inspection.", 
    "But if the circuit is more\ncomplicated, I usually have to", 
    "solve a non-linear, again, solve\na non-linear system.", 
    "In general, as I said before,\nthis was by inspection because", 
    "it&#39;s a very simple circuit.", 
    "But if I added some resistors\nand so on and so forth to the", 
    "circuit, then I would have to\nuse one of the non-linear", 
    "analysis techniques in order\nto write down the output of", 
    "the non-linear circuit.", 
    "But I could use an analytical\nmethod.", 
    "I could use a graphical\nmethod.", 
    "I could use computer\nsimulation,", 
    "whatever, doesn&#39;t matter.", 
    "I write down the large signal\nequation, and usually by", 
    "solving a non-linear circuit.", 
    "So next, let&#39;s come to the\nsmall signal response.", 
    "And here, the response, as you\nsaw, was ID, was given", 
    "by ID b times VD.", 
    "So if you recall, the ID\ntimes b was a constant.", 
    "And that constant was related\nto the slope of the function", 
    "at the point IDbD.", 
    "Now stare at this equation\nfor a moment.", 
    "You see ID equals a\nconstant times VD.", 
    "So where did you see a construct\nlike this before?", 
    "Where did you see a\nconstruct I equals", 
    "constant times V to 4.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I hope you haven&#39;t forgotten\nwhat you&#39;ve learned so far in", 
    "this course.", 
    "It&#39;s very, very simple stuff.", 
    "So where did you see I equals\na constant times b before?", 
    "Well, it was for our amazing\nresistor, OK?", 
    "So when we saw it before was\nfor a resistor, where if I", 
    "have a current, ID, flowing\nthrough this--", 
    "these are my small\nsignal values.", 
    "If I have a current, ID, flowing\nthrough it, and a", 
    "voltage, Vd, across it, and this\nhad some resistance, R.", 
    "Where by this expression\nhere, R is given by", 
    "1 divided by IDb.", 
    "So all I&#39;m doing here\nis taking a circuit", 
    "interpretation of\nthe equation.", 
    "All I&#39;ve done is taken a circuit\ninterpretation of my", 
    "ID equals constant times\nVd equation.", 
    "And that is no different from\nID being related to Vd,", 
    "according to a resistor\nrelationship where I picked 1", 
    "divided by this as the\nresistance, OK?", 
    "So in this equation, IDb is\nthe conductance of my", 
    "resistor, and the reciprocal of\nthat, 1 divided by IDb, is", 
    "the resistance.", 
    "And the resistance itself is\ngiven by this expression,", 
    "where we call dfVD by dVD,\nevaluated at VD equals the", 
    "operating point.", 
    "And the reciprocal of that\ngives me my resistance.", 
    "So what this says is that what\nyou do is you take your", 
    "function, or you take any\nelement, and you find out for", 
    "small signals--", 
    "you take the derivative of the\nfunction as shown here.", 
    "And in this particular instance,\nit ends up being a", 
    "resistor of value, 1 divided\nby I times b.", 
    "So for our little device, the\ncurrent is related to the", 
    "voltage using a resistor\nrelation.", 
    "Let&#39;s just stare at\nthis for a second.", 
    "This is actually pretty\nremarkable.", 
    "What is this really,\nreally telling us?", 
    "This is telling us that for this\nLED device, which had an", 
    "exponential relationship, for\nsmall signals, that device", 
    "behaves like a resistor.", 
    "This is so remarkable that\nI will say it again.", 
    "That is, even though I have an\nexponential device for small", 
    "variations in the voltage.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So for small variations in the\nvoltage here, my current is", 
    "such that the device must have\nbeen behaving like a resistor.", 
    "So therefore, I can build a\nsmall signal circuit, in which", 
    "I can replace the device by a\nresistor in order to find out", 
    "how the circuit behaves.", 
    "This is amazing.", 
    "So for small signals, my device", 
    "behaves like a resistor.", 
    "I&#39;m sorry, I overwrote where\nthis thing appears to simply", 
    "say, for small signals,\nthe device has the", 
    "behavior of a resistor.",
