    "SPEAKER 1: Let's now get some insight into how to compute", 
    "the frequency of oscillation.", 
    "I'm going to give you a fair amount of hints, and then we", 
    "will have a little exercise that you can use to solve it", 
    "for yourselves.", 
    "So let's start with trying to figure out two things.", 
    "First, to find the frequency of oscillation, we are going", 
    "look to find the time period of oscillation.", 
    "So this is my time period.", 
    "There is a rise time, which is here.", 
    "So this is the rise time, and this is the fall time of", 
    "capacitor voltage.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So what I'm going to do is start by trying to figure out", 
    "the rise time of the capacitor voltage, that is this time.", 
    "And in order to do so, let me go ahead and pick my axes like", 
    "this, and pick the zero point right here.", 
    "Once the system goes into a steady state, recall that, for", 
    "the rise, the capacitor voltage is going to go up from", 
    "minus Vs by 2 all the way up to plus Vs by 2.", 
    "So let's go ahead and try to figure out what that time is.", 
    "So this is vC, the capacitor voltage.", 
    "So to figure out vC, I could write down in general, for a", 
    "rising capacitor voltage, the intuitive method of figuring", 
    "out the rise time is the following.", 
    "So vC will be some initial voltage on capacitor, initial", 
    "voltage on capacitor plus the change in voltage times 1", 
    "minus e raised to minus t over RC.", 
    "So recall, this was the intuitive", 
    "formula that we had discussed.", 
    "So what is initial?", 
    "Initial is the value that the capacitor", 
    "voltage starts out with.", 
    "It starts out at some initial value, and then I'm going to", 
    "take a change.", 
    "The change is that?", 
    "What do you think?", 
    "Nope, that is actually not the change.", 
    "OK?", 
    "The change that we're talking about is the voltage that the", 
    "capacitor would have reached had it gone all the way to its", 
    "high value.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So this is not the change we have to look at.", 
    "We have to look at the final value of the capacitor voltage", 
    "had the capacitor gone all the way without having been", 
    "stopped, because the operational amplifier switched", 
    "its output voltages.", 
    "So the change in the capacitor voltage is actually given by", 
    "this delta.", 
    "OK, so this is the delta.", 
    "So this is the delta.", 
    "Starting at Vs minus 2 and, if left to itself, the capacitor", 
    "would've gone all the way to Vs. That is what we have to", 
    "use for this formula.", 
    "So in this formula, the initial value is simply minus", 
    "Vs over two.", 
    "That's the initial value in the capacitor.", 
    "Where is the change, then?", 
    "The change is the final value minus initial value.", 
    "The final value, as we discussed just now, that the", 
    "capacitor would reach had it charged completely all by", 
    "itself at time t equals infinity, that is Vs.", 
    "So if I have a straight old RC circuit R and a capacitor C", 
    "and have a voltage Vs here, then the capacitor will keep", 
    "charging until the capacitor reaches Vs. This is the final,", 
    "irrespective of what its initial value is.", 
    "And if its initial value is minus Vs by two, then the", 
    "capacitor will charge all the way up to Vs, and so that is", 
    "what we have to use in the formula on", 
    "the right hand side.", 
    "So the change is Vs minus the initial", 
    "value in the capacitor.", 
    "And the initial value in the capacitor is", 
    "minus Vs over two.", 
    "So, therefore, the change is three Vs divided by 2.", 
    "So now that we have that, the formula for vC will simply be", 
    "vC equals minus Vs over 2 plus 3Vs divided by 2 times the 1", 
    "minus e raised to minus t over RC.", 
    "So what is the rise time?", 
    "The rise time will be given by this expression.", 
    "Let me just clean up the area a little bit.", 
    "So Vs minus minus Vs divided by 2 is 3 Vs divided by 2.", 
    "Now let me write down how I compute tr.", 
    "So to compute tr, notice that tr is the time it takes, so", 
    "this is tr.", 
    "Let me call that t rise.", 
    "That t rise is the time it takes the capacitor voltage vC", 
    "to go from minus Vs over 2 to plus Vs over 2, to the point", 
    "that it reaches here.", 
    "So, therefore, tr will be Vs over 2 equals minus Vs divided", 
    "by 2 plus 3 Vs divided by 2 times 1 minus e raised to", 
    "minus tr divided by RC.", 
    "So I can solve that equation in order to get tr.", 
    "Again, I'm going to repeat this.", 
    "The way I got this equation was I said I need to find out", 
    "how to get tr, so let me repeat this one more time.", 
    "So my goal is to find tr.", 
    "And so to find tr, I started off by writing", 
    "an equation in vC.", 
    "So equation in vC for a rising capacitor voltage is simply", 
    "you start with the initial value in the capacitor, and", 
    "then you add to that the change from the starting value", 
    "to its final steady state value times 1 minus e raised", 
    "to blah blah blah.", 
    "We know initial value is minus Vs over two, and the change is", 
    "3Vs over two, because I have to go to the change from minus", 
    "Vs over two all the way to plus Vs. The change, then is", 
    "3Vs over 2.", 
    "Now, that rise time is the time it takes the capacitor to", 
    "go from minus Vs over 2 to plus Vs over 2.", 
    "So therefore, I stick plus Vs over 2 here, and that will be", 
    "equal to the initial value plus the change, had the", 
    "capacitor gone all the way, times 1 minus e raised to", 
    "minus tr over RC.", 
    "So I can solve this equation for tr and that gives", 
    "me this rise time."
