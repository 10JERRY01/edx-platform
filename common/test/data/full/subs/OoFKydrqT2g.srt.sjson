    "SPEAKER: So here is a solution for the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor, v(t) equals VI minus VI cosine of omega 0t.", 
    "And as you recall, the equation for the current I of", 
    "t was CVI omega0 sine omega0t.", 
    "So let's go ahead and plot both of these voltage and", 
    "currents out and see what they look like.", 
    "This is the total solution.", 
    "So commonly, when we plot these things, you might", 
    "imagine we can just plot them versus t.", 
    "But we do it in a slightly stylized manner.", 
    "And we commonly plot them with respect to omega0t.", 
    "So I'm going to plot both the current and the voltage, and", 
    "use omega0t as my x-axis.", 
    "So by doing so, I get my x-axis being in radians.", 
    "And so let's mark this as pi/2.", 
    "Let's mark this as pi, 3 pi/2, 2 pi, and so on.", 
    "It makes it a little easier to plot.", 
    "Similarly for my current, I get pi/2, pi, 3 pi/2,", 
    "2 pi, and so on.", 
    "So let's start with my voltage.", 
    "So for the voltage, let's go ahead and stay with this.", 
    "So the voltage is VI minus VI cosine of omega0t.", 
    "So when t is equal to 0, cosine omega0t is 1.", 
    "So VI minus VI then becomes 0.", 
    "So I get a 0 for t equal to 0.", 
    "Next, when omega0t is pi/2, cosine of pi/2 is 0.", 
    "So at pi/2, cosine of omega0t is cosine of pi/2 is 0.", 
    "And so therefore V of t is capital V, capital I.", 
    "So let me write that down here and mark this as capital V,", 
    "capital I. And this will be 2VI, because that's VI and--", 
    "all right.", 
    "So this is what I get.", 
    "And then when I have cosine of omega0t, when omega0t is pi.", 
    "So when this is pi, what do I get?", 
    "I get minus 1.", 
    "So minus 1 times minus VI is plus VI.", 
    "so V becomes 2VI, so I get a value here.", 
    "And then it proceeds in a symmetric manner, so I can", 
    "draw out my plot in the following manner, and so on.", 
    "So this is say sinusoid, starting out at 0.", 
    "So that is my voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "Right away, I see something very, very interesting.", 
    "Recall the circuit that we had.", 
    "It was the voltage source with a step that went from 0 to", 
    "capital V, capital I. And that was connected across an", 
    "inductor, which in turn went to a capacitor.", 
    "And I'm plotting the voltage, V, across the capacitor.", 
    "And I have some current, I, here.", 
    "So right away, you notice something very interesting.", 
    "Do you see it?", 
    "Something completely unusual and surprising, which is that,", 
    "even though-- and first of all, the sinusoid is very", 
    "interesting.", 
    "Even though I had a step, I got a very interesting", 
    "sinusoid as my voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "I also got a sinusoid for the current.", 
    "So that is interesting.", 
    "I didn't input a sinusoid, but the circuit behavior", 
    "inherently produced sinusoids.", 
    "What a surprise.", 
    "Another equally surprising fact is, even though my input", 
    "just went from 0 to VI, notice that, at various points in", 
    "time, my capacitor voltage goes to twice the input.", 
    "Isn't that amazing?", 
    "There are times at which, even though my input was only", 
    "stepped up to VI, I got outputs here across the", 
    "capacitor that was twice the input value.", 
    "So this is amazing, this fact of the second order circuits,", 
    "where inductive capacitor circuits of the second order", 
    "can produce voltages that are higher than input voltages.", 
    "And these kinds of this property is actually used in", 
    "the voltage converters, typically step up converters", 
    "in your computers and so on as the power supplies, where", 
    "there might be a given voltage that is distributed to various", 
    "systems.", 
    "But you may have some kind of a power supply that steps up", 
    "the voltage or steps down the voltage.", 
    "So here's an example where I can get a step up in the", 
    "voltage, where at least in this case, it's a sinusoid.", 
    "And you will do a laboratory where you will see how you can", 
    "convert a sinusoid to get a DC voltage out of the sinusoid", 
    "using some diodes and things of that sort.", 
    "So two interesting facts, we got a sinusoid.", 
    "And second, the voltage actually was higher than the", 
    "input voltage that I had in my circuit.", 
    "Next, let's go ahead and plot the current.", 
    "So my current starts off at a value here, which is at time t", 
    "equals 0, my current is at 0.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "I is given by CVI omega0, sine omega0t.", 
    "So at t is 0, my right-hand side goes to 0, and I is 0.", 
    "Oh, a little mistake here.", 
    "My 0 should be here.", 
    "I'm glad I caught that.", 
    "Next, when omega0t is pi/2, then sine of pi.2 is 1.", 
    "And so, at this point, my current is CVI omega0.", 
    "At pi, my voltage goes to 0 again.", 
    "And I get down here, at 3 pi/2, I get minus 1 and times", 
    "CVI omega0.", 
    "So I end up at minus CVI omega0 here.", 
    "And I end up at the voltage here, and then back to here,", 
    "and so on and so forth.", 
    "So let me connect these up with a nice little sinusoid.", 
    "And there you go, not a great sinusoid, but I", 
    "think you get the point.", 
    "That is the current.", 
    "So keep this in mind, that even though I had this little", 
    "0 to VI step, I was able to get sinusoids and voltages", 
    "that were greater than VI.", 
    "Next I'd like to show you a little demo, and do two things", 
    "with that demo.", 
    "First of all, I'd like to give you some intuition as to why", 
    "are we getting the sinusoid.", 
    "Why is it that we're getting this funny behavior?", 
    "When I put a step input, why am I getting sinusoids out of", 
    "the circuit?", 
    "So I'd like to describe and give you some intuition behind", 
    "why is it that an inductive and capacitor circuit can", 
    "produce a sinusoid, just by looking at the very basic", 
    "dynamics of what is going on with voltages and currents in", 
    "the inductor and capacitor.", 
    "And following that, I'll show you some waveforms of a real", 
    "inductive capacitor circuit, so you can see for yourselves", 
    "how it looks like."
