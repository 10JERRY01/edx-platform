    "SPEAKER: Here is what we can do.", 
    "So notice that this value of dOUT mimics this value.", 
    "It's a buffered value.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to feed this value back", 
    "to refresh this node.", 
    "So up here is my switch.", 
    "I'm going to put a switch out there.", 
    "And what I'm going to do is the following.", 
    "Recall, when store is on, this will be shorted.", 
    "This will be like a short circuit, possibly with a small", 
    "resistance RON, and this capacitor will recharge.", 
    "I expect that.", 
    "What I'm going to do now is I want to", 
    "connect store bar here.", 
    "Store bar.", 
    "In other words, when store is a 1, this is a short circuit.", 
    "And this is an open circuit, because store bar will be a 0.", 
    "But when store is a 0, then store bar will be a 1.", 
    "It's exactly flipped.", 
    "So when store is a 0, this will be an open circuit here.", 
    "This will be open.", 
    "And when store bar becomes 1, because store is a 0, then", 
    "this will be shorted.", 
    "So this becomes a short circuit, then I want to write", 
    "the value dOUT back into this capacitive node.", 
    "So I want you to think about whether it works.", 
    "Let me describe it again.", 
    "So when store is a 1, dIN gets written into the capacitor.", 
    "That is clear.", 
    "When store is a 0, then dIN [? stops ?]", 
    "getting written into the capacitor.", 
    "Rather, store bar becomes true now, and the output begins to", 
    "get written into the capacitor.", 
    "This is called a refresh.", 
    "So the same value is recycled, and it", 
    "refreshes the capacitor.", 
    "So this is a cool little trick.", 
    "So when store is not on--", 
    "in other words, when the switch is open", 
    "at the input here--", 
    "then the output is coupled back into the input node", 
    "through the store bar switch and refreshes the capacitor.", 
    "So let me ask you, does this work?", 
    "Does this work?", 
    "If you like, you can hit the pause button and think about", 
    "it for yourself before I give you the answer and then go", 
    "into looking at some more designs.", 
    "So hit the pause button and think about it yourselves.", 
    "Does this work?", 
    "OK, so does this work?", 
    "Actually, no.", 
    "This does not work.", 
    "And the reason it does not work is that notice that this", 
    "connects to some external system here.", 
    "So if instantaneously or temporarily, the external", 
    "system somehow has a very low resistance to ground--", 
    "let's say, for example, this was a huge capacitor where the", 
    "initial capacitance value was 0 volts.", 
    "Then, when I connect this other circuit with a huge", 
    "capacitor at 0 to the output node here, and if the store", 
    "bar was true, then that 0 volts gets coupled into this", 
    "small capacitor here.", 
    "And then the output might directly influence the input.", 
    "That is not something that I want.", 
    "In my memory abstraction, recall, I had a dIN, a dOUT,", 
    "and a store.", 
    "And there's no condition under which the output was", 
    "influencing the stored value.", 
    "And in this case, I've just shown you a situation where", 
    "the output could be influencing the stored value.", 
    "For instance, if I have a huge capacitor here with an initial", 
    "value of 0, and as I begin charging this capacitor,", 
    "instantaneously, that 0 volts from the capacitor will be", 
    "seen by this capacitor here.", 
    "The internal capacitor C and the load capacitor CL will", 
    "share their charge.", 
    "And boom, the internal node might get affected and my", 
    "discharge through charge sharing.", 
    "So this does not work, because the external value can", 
    "influence the storage node.", 
    "So what do we do?", 
    "That's a third attempt.", 
    "All right, let's try to have our fourth attempt and see if", 
    "I can make it work.", 
    "So in my third attempt, I did have buffers connected.", 
    "And this was the dOUT, and this was my vC.", 
    "That was my storage voltage.", 
    "So here is what I'm going to do.", 
    "What the buffers have done is they've decoupled the possible", 
    "load from my storage node.", 
    "However, recall because of the refresh that I was doing from", 
    "here, the output load was able to go and affect the capacitor", 
    "and change its value.", 
    "So I'm going to cause some more decoupling to happen.", 
    "Here's what I'm going to do.", 
    "I will take the value from here, pass it through another", 
    "inverter, and go through a switch, as before, store bar", 
    "controlling the switch.", 
    "And this goes to my--", 
    "oops, let me go here.", 
    "This goes to my storage node.", 
    "What have I done here?", 
    "What I've done here is I've completely decoupled the", 
    "output node from the storage node.", 
    "So I've taken the values of this is x, This is x bar, and", 
    "this is x again.", 
    "So this is x bar, then this is x.", 
    "So what I've done is that the value stored x", 
    "appears as x bar here.", 
    "And that x bar is further inverted, and it's used to", 
    "refresh the capacitive node when store is false.", 
    "So this is 1, 0, this is 0, 1.", 
    "So when this input store is a 0, then dIN is decoupled from", 
    "the capacitor.", 
    "But x bar gets coupled into the node here through the", 
    "inverter, which makes x, So I refresh the input signal.", 
    "What that does is that it not only decouples the output from", 
    "the input when the output is reading it.", 
    "And even better, when refreshes happen, the output", 
    "is also decoupled from the input.", 
    "Notice that there's no path from the output back to the", 
    "input, because it is completely decoupled using", 
    "this inverter.", 
    "So does this work?", 
    "I'll let you think for a couple of seconds if this", 
    "works, and then I'll give you the answer.", 
    "Well, clearly, you've unpaused me again.", 
    "So this does work.", 
    "So this is one workable design for what I called static", 
    "memories or static random access memories where the", 
    "value of the memory cell stays valid for a", 
    "long period of time.", 
    "And the reason it stays valid for a long period of time is", 
    "that it is being refreshed continually by this inverter", 
    "from the power supply voltage."
