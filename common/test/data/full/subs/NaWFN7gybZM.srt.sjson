    "SPEAKER: I hope you had fun with the demo.", 
    "And again, recall I have a pair of inverters here with", 
    "signals A here, B here, and C here.", 
    "And I apply this square wave at A. I applied this one at B.", 
    "And I obtained this one at C. So the waveform at A resulted", 
    "in an inverted waveform at B. And then I got this final", 
    "waveform at C. OK, so really we expected B and C", 
    "to look like this.", 
    "And we were completely unprepared for what we saw.", 
    "So what do we see?", 
    "So what we saw was B did not quite look like a square wave.", 
    "So B kind to looked like this.", 
    "This is what B looked like.", 
    "So B looked like this green thing here.", 
    "And from here, it looked like this.", 
    "It looked like this.", 
    "OK, that was very interesting.", 
    "I should be careful note to mark that up.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "And so let me write that down.", 
    "I really observed this.", 
    "Total surprise.", 
    "I'm just not used to seeing these funny shapes show up.", 
    "And it's completely new.", 
    "And then, what did I see in C?", 
    "So in C, I expected the waveform to", 
    "look as shown here.", 
    "But what I ended up seeing was something", 
    "that looked like this.", 
    "That was a surprise.", 
    "I saw more or less a square wave. But notice that the", 
    "square wave was somehow offset from the original square wave.", 
    "In other words, I noticed that there was some", 
    "delay in the C output.", 
    "It appeared that the C was indeed a square wave. but it", 
    "seemed to be delayed a little bit from what I expected.", 
    "So this delay was strange.", 
    "It was something that I simply did not expect.", 
    "So I'm going to leave you with this", 
    "surprising little snippet.", 
    "I'm not going to explain it now.", 
    "But when we finish up this unit, when me finish up this", 
    "lecture sequence, at the end of the lecture sequence, I am", 
    "going to connect back to this little example here.", 
    "And hopefully by that time, you will have a a-ha moment", 
    "along the way where you will see why exactly did B and C", 
    "behave like this.", 
    "In other words, why was it that B had this", 
    "funny shapes here?", 
    "And why was it that C was delayed from where I", 
    "expected it to be?", 
    "So we shall see in the sequence why did", 
    "these things happen.", 
    "And of course, if you want to jump ahead, you can go ahead", 
    "and look it up in chapters 9 and 10 of the textbook.", 
    "Let's keep moving ahead.", 
    "And what I'd like to start by doing is taking a closer look", 
    "at what is inside one of these MOSFETs.", 
    "What exactly does a MOSFET look like on the inside?", 
    "And try to define some of the physical properties, physical", 
    "structure of the MOSFET itself.", 
    "And see, what is the element that is really in there?", 
    "And then, build up some intuition.", 
    "And then try to build some new elements and", 
    "understand how they work.", 
    "So if I look at my MOSFET.", 
    "So on the right-hand side, you see the symbol of my MOSFET.", 
    "This is my usual MOSFET with a drain, the", 
    "gate, and the source.", 
    "And this is called n-channel MOSFET.", 
    "Let's start by taking a look at how we", 
    "build a n-channel MOSFET.", 
    "We start with silicon.", 
    "I show you here a block of silicon.", 
    "This piece of silicon.", 
    "Silicon comes from sand, so there's tons and tons of sand", 
    "around the world.", 
    "And sand contains silicon as one of", 
    "its two primary elements.", 
    "The other is oxygen, it's silicon dioxide.", 
    "And silicon is a key element.", 
    "Now, what I do first is we go through a", 
    "process called doping.", 
    "We dope silicon with a p-type element", 
    "with some p-type material.", 
    "And what that does is that it causes silicon to have", 
    "somewhat excess of water called holes.", 
    "Hole is a lack of an electron.", 
    "Because of that, this piece of silicon becomes what is called", 
    "a semiconductor.", 
    "it is not an insulator and it is not a fantastic conductor,", 
    "it is a semiconductor.", 
    "So p-type silicon now is a semiconductor, and it conducts", 
    "electricity reasonably.", 
    "It's not great, but pretty reasonable.", 
    "So I have this piece of silicon.", 
    "And by the way, the dimensions I'm showing you here are very,", 
    "very small.", 
    "What I'm going to do here is I'm going to have you think", 
    "about what this dimension might look like.", 
    "So in other words, what the dimension might look like.", 
    "So as soon as I finish my sentence here, I want you to", 
    "hit the Pause button and think about what that dimension", 
    "might be before I tell you what the dimension is.", 
    "OK, hope you had a chance to think about what that", 
    "dimension is.", 
    "Let me tell you, this is very, very, very small.", 
    "In today's technologies, these dimensions where which as I", 
    "will show you, we'll construct the physical structure of a", 
    "MOSFET, is on the order of a few tens or nanometers.", 
    "It's extremely, extremely small.", 
    "Recall that nanometer is 10 to the minus 9 of a meter.", 
    "So a nanometer is a billionth of a meter.", 
    "So this is really, really tiny.", 
    "So I take a piece of p-type silicon now, which is a", 
    "semiconductor.", 
    "And what I do next is I go through a bit of processing.", 
    "Let me start by putting some oxide on here.", 
    "So let me mark that as--", 
    "let me just show that as a little dotted thing here.", 
    "So this is called oxide.", 
    "This is silicon dioxide.", 
    "And it can be grown in various ways.", 
    "And so I put a very thin layer of oxide.", 
    "And this oxide is an insulator.", 
    "It does not let current to go through.", 
    "Then what I do is I put in another layer", 
    "on top of the oxide.", 
    "And let me make this new layer bluish in color.", 
    "And this is my new layer.", 
    "And this layer here can be one of many things.", 
    "It could be metal or it could be something called", 
    "polysilicon.", 
    "It is a conductive form of silicon.", 
    "So now, what do you see here?", 
    "You see a metal, a very thin metal layer.", 
    "You see an insulator.", 
    "And then you see this p-type silicon.", 
    "So in terms of the MOSFET structure, this thing", 
    "here is your gate.", 
    "I still haven't shown you where the", 
    "drain and source are.", 
    "But this is your gate.", 
    "So right here, notice that this is already beginning to", 
    "resemble something you've seen in high school.", 
    "This is already beginning to resemble these things that", 
    "you've seen called capacitors.", 
    "You recall what a capacitor was in high school?", 
    "A capacitor, it comprised a plate here, a second plate", 
    "here where it was filled by some insulating material.", 
    "And two parallel plates with some insulator between them,", 
    "that's a capacitor.", 
    "That's one form of a capacitor.", 
    "So right here, it seems to me that this MOSFET structure", 
    "that I have kind of resembles a capacitor.", 
    "I have a little metal plate, or it could be", 
    "a polysilicon plate.", 
    "And then, I have a insulating oxide.", 
    "So let me just mark that down as insulating.", 
    "And then I have p-type silicon, which is a", 
    "semiconductor.", 
    "I'm not quite done yet.", 
    "So it's already beginning to resemble a capacitor."
