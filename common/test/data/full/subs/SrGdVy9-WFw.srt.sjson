    "SPEAKER 1: Let's now analyze a first-order RL circuit.", 
    "And this time around I'm going to use duality to my advantage", 
    "and perform the analysis extremely quickly, by using", 
    "the equations we developed for the capacitor as a reference.", 
    "So for the capacitive RL circuit, [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "use the series voltage and a resistor.", 
    "And here, just for fun, I'm going to use a Norton", 
    "equivalent type of circuit.", 
    "So I have a current source, and I have a resistor, and I'm", 
    "going to connect an inductor like so.", 
    "I'm going to ground this node so I can", 
    "apply the node method.", 
    "And let's say the current is iI of t, my resistor with", 
    "resistance R, and inductor with voltage L across it.", 
    "And so this voltage will be referenced as vL, and I'm", 
    "going to have some current flowing through the inductor.", 
    "I'm going to call it iL.", 
    "These are all time-dependent, and that's iL of t, and this", 
    "is vL of t.", 
    "So I'm going to analyze that circuit for you, and let's see", 
    "what we get.", 
    "OK.", 
    "To analyze the circuit, I start with", 
    "applying the node method.", 
    "Applying the node method here, what do I get?", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "So let me start by labeling this node voltage.", 
    "This is vL.", 
    "I've already selected my ground node down here.", 
    "And so let me sum the currents leaving the node.", 
    "So iI is entering the node, so that is minus iI since it's", 
    "entering the node.", 
    "And the current going down here is plus vL divided by R.", 
    "And the current leaving down here is also plus iL, and the", 
    "whole thing sums up to 0.", 
    "So the next step, I'm going to replace my voltage with the", 
    "currents here.", 
    "And so I'm going to get minus iI and plus 1 by R, and I'm", 
    "going to replace my voltage with the L di dt.", 
    "Recall, for the inductor, vL is given by L diL by dt.", 
    "So it's L diL dt.", 
    "So I'm going to replace this with-- let's make this L here,", 
    "dil dt, plus iL equals 0.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So then what I'll do is I'm just going to go ahead and", 
    "move iI to the right-hand side.", 
    "So I get L divided by R, diL dt, plus iL equals iI.", 
    "There's my key differential equation that I get.", 
    "Now I can very quickly look at the equation for the capacitor", 
    "as a reference.", 
    "And so let me switch to green here and write", 
    "that out for you.", 
    "OK, good.", 
    "So for the capacitor, you recall the differential", 
    "equation that I got for the series RC circuit was RC dvC", 
    "dt, plus vC.", 
    "And that was equal to the input drive, vI.", 
    "And also recall that this component here was what we", 
    "call a time constant, and we gave it a little notation", 
    "symbol, tau.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Now let's, by analogy, look at the equation that we've", 
    "developed for my RL circuit.", 
    "First of all, notice that here I've chosen iL as my variable.", 
    "And for an inductor, that is a convenient way to go.", 
    "So that's the first thing to observe.", 
    "So now I have an equation in iL, diL dt times L over R plus", 
    "iL equals iI.", 
    "The second thing to observe is, notice that units of", 
    "current, units of current--", 
    "this must have units of current as well.", 
    "And so of course di has units of current.", 
    "And since there's dt at the bottom here, L by R also must", 
    "have time units.", 
    "So L by R has units of time.", 
    "And not surprisingly, this is the time", 
    "constant for the RL circuit.", 
    "So it's time constant tau for RL circuit.", 
    "So L over R has units of time, and this L over R is analogous", 
    "to the RC for the capacitive circuit.", 
    "So for the inductive circuit, it's L over R, and for the", 
    "capacitive circuit, the time constant was RC.", 
    "So keep that in mind as well.", 
    "So as my next step, now that I have this equation, I'm going", 
    "to simply write down the solution to this equation by", 
    "inspection based on the solution I obtained for the", 
    "capacitor circuit.", 
    "So let me draw out my RL circuit here.", 
    "So this was iI.", 
    "And in my RL circuit that I've been analyzing, this is R and", 
    "this is my inductor, L. This is iL, and this is ground.", 
    "Then the node voltage here is vL.", 
    "That's the voltage across inductor.", 
    "And also I'll need to assume an initial condition on the", 
    "inductor, and so let's assume that I'm given the current", 
    "through the inductor at time 0 to be iL of 0.", 
    "Now I could go ahead and try to solve the differential", 
    "equation for this example, and in order to do so, I'm going", 
    "to pick something for my input current.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "Let me go ahead and assume, so I can get a specific solution", 
    "to this circuit.", 
    "Let me go ahead and pick iI of t to be some constant, II.", 
    "And let me also pick a specific value,", 
    "[? looking at ?]", 
    "simple notation here for my initial current through the", 
    "inductor, and make that I0.", 
    "So I0 is the initial current at time t equal to 0.", 
    "So this is given.", 
    "This is the current through the inductor at", 
    "time t equal to 0.", 
    "So in terms of a different equation for the inductor,", 
    "that becomes L by R, diL by dt.", 
    "All of that is the same. iL.", 
    "And the only thing that changes is the right-hand", 
    "side, where previously I had the input.", 
    "And in this case, the input current is", 
    "simply a constant, iI.", 
    "Recall, this is my time constant, tau, for the", 
    "inductor circuit.", 
    "So as a reference, let me just throw up the circuit we", 
    "analyzed for the capacitor, and just take a quick look and", 
    "see the analogy here.", 
    "So notice that, for the inductor circuit, I have a", 
    "Norton equivalent driving an inductor.", 
    "And here, for the capacitor--", 
    "this is for the capacitor example--", 
    "I had a Thevenin equivalent driving the capacitor.", 
    "My iI of t is taken to be II, and in this case, my vi of t", 
    "was taken to be vi.", 
    "Initial current, given.", 
    "Initial voltage across the capacitor, given.", 
    "And finally, this was the equation that I developed.", 
    "So very similar.", 
    "Notice how inductor currents are replaced", 
    "by capacitive voltages.", 
    "So let me just mark things over.", 
    "So this, this, and this are the duals of the vC here.", 
    "II and vi correspond.", 
    "And the time constant here--", 
    "this is tau for the capacitive circuit.", 
    "So notice that really the key to these kinds of analyses is", 
    "that you wil use RC as time constant for the capacitor and", 
    "L divided by R as the time constant for the inductor."
