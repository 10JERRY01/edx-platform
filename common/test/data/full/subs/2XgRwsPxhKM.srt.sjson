    "SPEAKER 1: We are now ready to\ndefine the incremental method.", 
    "The incremental method\nhas three steps.", 
    "The first step of the method,\nas we saw just now, is to", 
    "operate at some DC offset\nor bias point VD, ID.", 
    "So you have to boost your\nsignal in a way that the", 
    "circuits operates\nat some DC bias.", 
    "So let&#39;s call that VD, ID as\nan example for the circuit", 
    "that we&#39;ve been using.", 
    "The second step, what you do\nis that you superimpose a", 
    "small input signal, vd.", 
    "This is the signal of interest.\nThis signal is", 
    "superimposed on top of\nyour DC offset, VD.", 
    "And as a third step in your\nincremental method is the", 
    "recognition that the response\nid to the small signal vd is", 
    "approximately linear.", 
    "So if you boost your signal up\nby VD, ID, capital VD, capital", 
    "ID, and you superimpose a small\nsignal on top of that,", 
    "then your small signal response,\nsmall i, small d, to", 
    "the small signal input, small\nv, small d, will be", 
    "approximately linear.", 
    "So this is the basic method.", 
    "So before I move on to looking\nat all the mathematical", 
    "foundations of it, I&#39;d like to\nformalize some notation that I", 
    "have very quietly\nsnuck by you.", 
    "OK, so notation.", 
    "This notation is\nthe following.", 
    "My total signal is iD, and that\nis going to be a sum of a", 
    "DC offset plus a small signal\nresponse id, where in this", 
    "case ID is my DC offset, and\nid, small i, small d, is a", 
    "small superimposed signal.", 
    "All right?", 
    "And then, by adding up the\nDC offset and the small", 
    "superimposed signal,\nI get my total", 
    "variable, or my total signal.", 
    "This is true whether it&#39;s for\nthe input or whether it&#39;s for", 
    "other measured quantities\nin the circuit.", 
    "So given this nomenclature,\nand given the small signal", 
    "method, before we actually go\nabout building circuits, I", 
    "would like to spend a little\nbit of time looking at what", 
    "does this really mean\nmathematically.", 
    "I&#39;ve shown you this thing\ngraphically and shown you why", 
    "graphically this looks like it\nmust be true, because a small", 
    "region of this curve\nlooked linear.", 
    "And then I showed you a small\nsignal circuit and showed you", 
    "how we can construct the\nsmall signal model.", 
    "The next step, I&#39;d like to show\nyou some insight as to", 
    "why the small signal\nresponse is", 
    "actually going to be linear.", 
    "I&#39;d like to do some math and\ndemonstrate to you that", 
    "there&#39;s a mathematical\nfoundations to the small", 
    "signal method.", 
    "So what did we do so far?", 
    "So we took our signal, which was\niD, for some function of", 
    "the input, vD.", 
    "Notice that this\nwas non-linear.", 
    "Then what we did, let&#39;s just\nwalk through a construction,", 
    "look at what we did, and then\nI&#39;ll convince you why that", 
    "should yield in a\nlinear response.", 
    "So what we did was we replaced\nvD with something else.", 
    "So I have an input vD here.", 
    "We replaced vD as follows.", 
    "We took vD, and we said, I want\nto replace it with a DC", 
    "value plus a small signal, a\nvery small signal value.", 
    "So this was my large DC value.", 
    "And because I&#39;m doing math here,\nin math we represent", 
    "small values or small changes\nabout a DC value", 
    "using a delta notation.", 
    "So let me just call that\nvD, small v, capital", 
    "D, and delta vD.", 
    "So delta vD represents the\nchange, delta, about", 
    "the DC offset vD.", 
    "So this is a small increment,\nor a small change, about vD.", 
    "When we talk about circuits and\nso on, notice that we are", 
    "going to replace this more\nconveniently with", 
    "small v, small d.", 
    "So just when doing the math, I&#39;m\ngoing to use delta vD, but", 
    "in circuits, we&#39;ll use a more\nconvenient notation,", 
    "small v, small d.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So what we really did was\nwe took our input, vD.", 
    "And notice that the output of\ninterest was iD, which was", 
    "some non-linear function\nof vD.", 
    "So what we did was we replaced\nvD by a sum of a DC value and", 
    "a small signal, a small\nincrement about the DC value.", 
    "Now go back to your math.", 
    "When you see signals that are\na constant value, and you&#39;re", 
    "looking to observe changes about\nthat small value, what", 
    "mathematical technique\ncomes to mind?", 
    "Well, Taylor&#39;s series\ncomes to mind.", 
    "And I want to use Taylor&#39;s\nexpansion to expand f of vD", 
    "about the point capital VD.", 
    "So I&#39;m trying to figure out how\nthe function behaves for a", 
    "vD for a small increment about\nsome DC value, VD.", 
    "So Taylor&#39;s series is a natural,\nmathematical tool to", 
    "use in this situation to look\nat what my small signal", 
    "response, or small incremental\nresponse, is going to be about", 
    "the point capital V, capital D.\nSo let&#39;s write out Taylor&#39;s", 
    "series for the situation where\nI have iD equals f of vD, and", 
    "we&#39;ll replaced vD with capital\nV, capital D, plus delta vD.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and\nwrite that out.", 
    "So this is my iD.", 
    "So what is iD, by using\nTaylor&#39;s expansion?", 
    "Well, iD is simply going to be\nf of the function at that", 
    "point, the DC point.", 
    "So it&#39;s a function at the DC\npoint plus some change.", 
    "So f of VD is simply the\nfunction computed at the DC", 
    "point plus some change.", 
    "That change is given by the\nrest of this expression.", 
    "So the change is given by the\nderivative of the function", 
    "about the point VD times the\nchange plus other stuff.", 
    "So the derivative of the\nfunction about that point is", 
    "given by this, so d by\ndvD of the function.", 
    "So the derivative respect to\nVD of the function f of vD.", 
    "And that would have to be\nevaluated at the point vD", 
    "equals capital VD times the\nincrement plus other stuff.", 
    "By Taylor&#39;s series, I compute\nthe function at the fixed", 
    "point, at the DC point.", 
    "And then I take the derivative,\nthe first", 
    "derivative of the function, df\nof vD by d by dvD of f of vD,", 
    "the first derivative, evaluated\nat vD equals capital", 
    "VD, times the incremental\nchange in vD.", 
    "Plus I take the second\nderivative.", 
    "So it&#39;s plus 1 by 2 factorial\nof the second derivative of", 
    "the function.", 
    "So it&#39;s a second derivative\nof the function.", 
    "And that evaluated at the same\npoint vD equals capital VD.", 
    "And that times delta\nvD squared.", 
    "And that plus other terms.", 
    "OK, so what do I have so far?", 
    "So iD can be expressed as the\nfunction evaluated at the", 
    "fixed point plus a component\nrelated to the derivative of", 
    "the function at the point vD\nequals capital VD times the", 
    "incremental change plus 1 by 2\nfactorial times the second", 
    "derivative times the square\nof the change, and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "And those are higher\norder terms.", 
    "OK, so let&#39;s stare at\nthis for a second.", 
    "To simplify my life here, what\nI&#39;m going to do is notice that", 
    "I chose delta vD to be small.", 
    "So delta vD is small.", 
    "If delta vD is small, then what\nI can do is I can neglect", 
    "higher order terms.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to neglect higher\norder terms. I&#39;m going to", 
    "neglect higher order terms\nbecause delta vD&#39;s small.", 
    "OK, because delta vD--", 
    "I&#39;m sorry, because delta vD is\nsmall, I&#39;m going to neglect", 
    "higher order terms.", 
    "I&#39;m going to neglect the term\nrelated to delta vD squared.", 
    "There&#39;s a term related to delta\nvD cubed, and the fourth", 
    "order, and so on and so forth.", 
    "I&#39;m just going to focus on the\nfixed term and the term", 
    "related to delta vD.",
