    "At the end of the day, we want\nto process information, we", 
    "want to communicate information,\nand we want to", 
    "store information.", 
    "So let&#39;s look at how we\nprocess information.", 
    "And processing involves doing\nthings like arithmetic, you", 
    "can do things like\nlogic and so on.", 
    "So let&#39;s see what it means to\nprocess these digital signals.", 
    "Recall also that these map\nnaturally to true and false.", 
    "So 1 and 0 would map\nto true and false.", 
    "We can also represent numbers\nwith these 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s.",

    "So for example, I leave\nyou with a question.", 
    "What is the number represented\nby 1011.", 
    "So as a hint, think about what\nis the number in the decimal", 
    "system represented by\n9065 for instance.",

    "represented by a 1011?",

    "digits is a binary digit?", 
    "In the case of the decimal\nnumber system, each of the", 
    "digits here can take on values\nbetween 0 and 9.", 
    "While in a binary the system,\nthe digits are either 0 or 1.",

    "in the binary system.", 
    "And to get a preview of this,\nyou might want to check", 
    "chapter 5.6 of the textbook.", 
    "Let&#39;s start with processing\ndigital signals.", 
    "We use Boolean logic\nto do this.", 
    "With Boolean logic we take these\nBoolean values, binary",

    "Think of that as processing\ntrue and false.", 
    "It&#39;s like processing logic,\nit&#39;s like making logical",

    "on values either 0 or 1.", 
    "So think of it as a binary\nvariable, which could take on",

    "So in this case, x, y, and z\nare all binary variables.", 
    "Think of them as digital\nsignals that can take",

    "And as I said earlier, I showed\nyou a little shorthand",

    "This is a AND gate.", 
    "I don&#39;t have the right AND\nin there, the shape of it", 
    "represents a AND gate.", 
    "Output is z.", 
    "And the inputs are x and y.", 
    "And this is exactly equivalent\nto saying z equals x dot y.",

    "And that is called the truth\ntable representation.", 
    "So in the truth table\nrepresentation, I enumerate", 
    "the values much like I did\na few seconds ago.", 
    "So I have x, and y,\nand my output z.", 
    "In a truth table representation,\nI tabulate all",

    "When x and y are 0 and 1\nrespectively, output z is",
