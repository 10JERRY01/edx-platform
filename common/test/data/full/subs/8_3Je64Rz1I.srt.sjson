    "SPEAKER 1: So let's proceed down that path.", 
    "And so remember, my equation A is simply my device relation.", 
    "And equation B turned into this little constraint, which", 
    "is a straight line constraint.", 
    "Notice it's a straight line relation between v0 and ids.", 
    "So how do I apply the graphical method?", 
    "The graphical method, essentially, what I do is I", 
    "superimpose this constraint on top of the constraints imposed", 
    "by the nonlinear device relations.", 
    "And so let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So I got, the red curves are my device relation.", 
    "And recall, I had a straight line reflecting this relation.", 
    "On one hand was Vs. And on the other side, it was Vs/RL.", 
    "So this equation, this line here, characterizes, is", 
    "reflective of B. So let me just mark that to be clear.", 
    "OK, that is because of B.", 
    "Now remember, when we discussed nonlinear methods a", 
    "couple of sequences ago, this constraint that we", 
    "superimposed on top of the device relationship, this was", 
    "called the load line.", 
    "The load line was reflective of the equation governing the", 
    "node at which we cared about the node voltage.", 
    "So we superimpose this load line on top of the device", 
    "relationship.", 
    "And that will give us the graphical method for analyzing", 
    "and for figuring out what the voltages will be.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So in order to get a solution, both A and B", 
    "constraints must be met.", 
    "And so by taking the graph reflective of the A", 
    "constraints in red, and the graph reflective of the B", 
    "constraints in green, and superimposing them, what that", 
    "says I should be able to readily compute the value.", 
    "Recall the values I care about are to find out v0 versus vI.", 
    "OK, so given a vI, what is v0?", 
    "OK, and recall, v0 is the same as vGS.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So let's jump ahead and do that without further ado.", 
    "So I've plotted a clean little load line for ourselves.", 
    "And what we need to do now is given a value of vI, so if I", 
    "give you vI, then you should be able to find v0 and iDS.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's do that.", 
    "I'm going to give you a value of vI.", 
    "Remember, you're trying to get v0 given a vI.", 
    "Because I'm going to give you a vI.", 
    "OK, so let's say I give you a vI.", 
    "So vI is changing like so.", 
    "So this is vGS3, vGS2, and so on.", 
    "It's the same as, call it vI2, vI1, and so on.", 
    "So let's say my vI is here.", 
    "So let's say this is my vI.", 
    "Let's say my vI is here.", 
    "Let's say this is the given vI.", 
    "So given that value for vI, how do I go ahead", 
    "and find v0 and iDS?", 
    "Well, it's very simple from this graph.", 
    "So if I tell you this is vI, then this current source curve", 
    "must apply.", 
    "If I put this value of vI, this value of current source", 
    "must apply.", 
    "So notice that this current source line is for vI2.", 
    "This current source line is for some other", 
    "value, vGS1 and so on.", 
    "And so I'm telling you that vI corresponds to this current", 
    "source line.", 
    "So in other words, this is the value of iDS for vI equal to", 
    "capital VI.", 
    "So just to make it very clear, I can go ahead and say, in", 
    "other words, for vGS equals capital VI, that this is the", 
    "current source curve that's going to apply.", 
    "The MOSFET curve is going to be constrained to be there.", 
    "So I will label this iDS.", 
    "So given a vI, from the MOSFET curves, I", 
    "automatically got iDS.", 
    "And then what would v0?", 
    "Well, notice that the v0 is given a value of iDS.", 
    "So given a value of vI, I immediately found", 
    "the value of iDS.", 
    "So that is iDS.", 
    "So given a value of vI, that's step one, I immediately found", 
    "a value of iDS, which is step two.", 
    "But given iDS, then I need to find a", 
    "constraint for v0 and iDS.", 
    "So notice that the load line is a constraint that iDS and", 
    "vDS must meet.", 
    "So any valid point of operation must", 
    "lie on the load line.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So given that, from the device relation, iDS must lie on this", 
    "line, and then from the load line constraint, it says iDS", 
    "and v0 are related like so.", 
    "Which means that this is the operating point, the point", 
    "where the device current curve intersects the load line.", 
    "And I can take it down here.", 
    "And that gives me my v0.", 
    "And this is my step three.", 
    "So I picked an i1 as a first step.", 
    "And I found the current source curve corresponding to it.", 
    "So I got iDS.", 
    "And then I found the intersection of the load line,", 
    "and that gave me v0.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So right there, I have now found us a relationship", 
    "between v0 and vI based on the graphical method."
