    "SPEAKER 1: OK, we are\nready to begin.", 
    "So, as I said earlier, 6.002x\nwill represent a big jump from", 
    "physics to EECS.", 
    "And let&#39;s just dive right into\nit and take a look at an", 
    "example of the kind of\nproblems that we", 
    "might want to solve.", 
    "So, suppose I have a battery\nhere that supplies the", 
    "voltage, v. And I connect\nthat to a light bulb.", 
    "And let&#39;s say that I wish to\nfind out the current, I, that", 
    "will flow through the bulb as\na result of connecting the", 
    "light bulb to the battery.", 
    "Now, I don&#39;t want to find\nout anything else.", 
    "All I want to know is, what is\nthe current through the bulb?", 
    "Oh, I want to remind you that as\nI go through various parts", 
    "of the course, I will point to\nreadings in the textbook.", 
    "And for this material in this\nset of segments, you will skim", 
    "chapter one of your textbook.", 
    "The readings are also indicated\nin your course at a", 
    "glance handout.", 
    "So with the kind of problem we\nwant to solve, with a battery", 
    "connected to a light bulb, I\nwant to find out what is the", 
    "current, I, through the bulb.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So, here&#39;s my problem.", 
    "Now, I could do it\nthe hard way.", 
    "As I&#39;ve said before, we have\ncaptured the way nature is", 
    "through sets of equations.", 
    "In particular, those\nthat relate to 6002", 
    "are Maxwell&#39;s equations.", 
    "So I&#39;ll parade a bunch of\nequations in front of you, and", 
    "don&#39;t get scared here.", 
    "This is the hard way.", 
    "This is not how we&#39;re going\nto do it in 6.002x.", 
    "I just want to show you how\nexciting and fun 6002 is, and", 
    "how simple things are.", 
    "But let me start by showing you\nhow we could do it if we", 
    "were crazy.", 
    "OK, so I showed you Maxwell&#39;s\nequations in differential form", 
    "or in integral form.", 
    "So for example, this is\nFaraday&#39;s equation--", 
    "del cross E is minus\ndel B by del t.", 
    "In integral form, it is integral\nE dot dl is minus del", 
    "phi B by del t, and so\non and so forth.", 
    "Now I could take Maxwell&#39;s\nequations, and of course, you", 
    "can go and solve all\nof them somehow.", 
    "It would be horrendously hard.", 
    "But normally this is not what we\ndo in 6002, and not what we", 
    "do as EECS engineers.", 
    "Instead, there is a much,\nmuch easier way.", 
    "We are going to make our life\nextraordinarily simple.", 
    "So before I show you what that\nmethod is, let me help us", 
    "build some insight.", 
    "So let&#39;s do it by analogy.", 
    "So supposing I have an object,\nand suppose I apply some", 
    "force, F, to the object.", 
    "And my question to you is, what\nis the acceleration of", 
    "the object?", 
    "OK, so if I ask you this\nsimple question--", 
    "I have an object, and I apply a\nforce, F, to the object, and", 
    "I ask you, what is the\nacceleration of the object?", 
    "I don&#39;t tell you\nanything else.", 
    "All right?", 
    "No more data.", 
    "I want you to think about how\nyou might solve this problem.", 
    "What sort of questions\nwould you ask me?", 
    "How would you answer\nthis problem?", 
    "Let me pause here for a couple\nof seconds, and give you some", 
    "time to think about the answer\nbefore I proceed.",
