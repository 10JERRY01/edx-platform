    "SPEAKER 1: Continuing on with our review for the RC circuit,", 
    "we could define a transfer function.", 
    "With a transfer function, it has to do with you take the", 
    "output complex amplitude, and you divide that by the input", 
    "amplitude, VI, which we took as real.", 
    "And that was given by 1 plus j omega RC.", 
    "So we call that H of j omega, OK?", 
    "And that is known as a transfer function.", 
    "Now we'll often talk about figuring out the frequency", 
    "response of a circuit.", 
    "When you do steady state analysis, a Sinusoidal Steady", 
    "State analysis, you're looking at finding out the behavior of", 
    "a circuit to sinusoids of different frequencies, OK?", 
    "So the analysis and the responses that you plot are", 
    "called the frequency response, not surprisingly.", 
    "There's two forms of two plots that frequency response", 
    "covers, the magnitude plot and the phase plot, OK?", 
    "So the magnitude plot relates to the modules of VP here.", 
    "And the phase of VP is the phase plot, OK?", 
    "So again, the magnitude and phase.", 
    "OK, similarly, as I said, we can", 
    "define a transfer function.", 
    "When I divide the complex amplitude of the output by the", 
    "amplitude of the input VI, and I get a transfer function.", 
    "I could similarly take the magnitude and phase of the", 
    "transfer function, OK?", 
    "So for example, if I take the magnitude of the transfer", 
    "function and plot it, I get VP divided by VI.", 
    "I take the magnitude, and I can rationalize the", 
    "denominator of the transfer function and", 
    "then take the magnitude.", 
    "The magnitude is given by 1 by square root of 1 plus omega", 
    "squared R squared C squared.", 
    "How would I get that?", 
    "I get that directly from here.", 
    "I rationalize the denominator by multiplying it by 1 minus j", 
    "omega RC, which gives me 1 minus omega", 
    "squared R squared C squared.", 
    "I end up with 1 minus j omega RC in the numerator.", 
    "And then I take the magnitude of that, which is square root", 
    "of 1 plus omega squared R squared C squared, which then", 
    "cancels out with the magnitude with the square in the", 
    "denominator, yielding this result for the magnitude of", 
    "the transfer function.", 
    "OK, I encourage you to go look at the complex algebra", 
    "appendix in the textbook for further information.", 
    "OK, so if you want a quick review of complex algebra, go", 
    "ahead and take a look at that.", 
    "All right, so let me go ahead and plot the magnitude of the", 
    "transfer function for you.", 
    "So in this case, notice that, when omega is zero, when I", 
    "plot omega on the x-axis--", 
    "it's frequency response, after all-- so I'm plotting the", 
    "magnitude as a function of frequency omega.", 
    "So when omega is zero, the magnitude of VP", 
    "over VI is 1, OK?", 
    "So I start off at 1.", 
    "And then I can also plot the value of--", 
    "so this is 1 here.", 
    "And also, when omega is very, very large, I get that the", 
    "function tapering off to zero, OK?", 
    "Out here, the function goes as 1 by omega RC, OK?", 
    "Notice that, when omega is large, 1 plus omega squared R", 
    "squared C squared tends to 1 by omega RC, OK?", 
    "So 1 by omega RC tends to zero.", 
    "And so this function goes so like this.", 
    "OK, there's some point at which the magnitude of the", 
    "transfer function is 1 by square root 2 of its initial", 
    "value, so of its value at omega equal to zero.", 
    "And so here, the frequency at which this happened is called", 
    "the break frequency.", 
    "And the break frequency for here is 1 by RC.", 
    "OK, notice that, in this little expression here, if an", 
    "omega is 1 divided by RC, what do I get?", 
    "I get 2 there.", 
    "So 1 plus 1 is 2.", 
    "And so I get 1 divided by the square root of 2.", 
    "So this is called the break frequency.", 
    "When we look at filters and so on in the next sequence, we", 
    "will understand the significance of break", 
    "frequency, OK?", 
    "So what this is saying is, as the frequency increases, minus", 
    "1 starts off, as I expect, at 1.", 
    "And then, the magnitude of the response keeps decaying.", 
    "OK, it falls to 1 by a square root 2 of its value at the", 
    "break frequency and then keeps falling thereafter.", 
    "OK, so I also want to remind you of the demo that you saw.", 
    "So in the demo, you recall we had a", 
    "little amplifier circuit.", 
    "And this was my output V naught.", 
    "And then I had a bias voltage, V bias.", 
    "I had a small signal sinusoid.", 
    "And let me just draw that small signal sinusoid here.", 
    "And then I said that I was going to feed the input to the", 
    "amplifier through a resistor, R. And here, I model the", 
    "capacitor, CGS.", 
    "This is a capacitance of the gate.", 
    "And this is the voltage that I'm trying to plot, V, OK?", 
    "So the circuit I've been trying to model has been this", 
    "circuit here with a sinusoidal voltage resistance, R, and a", 
    "voltage across the capacitor that I measure.", 
    "So now you can see why, in the demo, the voltage, V, became", 
    "very small.", 
    "The amplitude of V got very small when I increased the", 
    "frequency, OK?", 
    "So this was in my demo.", 
    "OK, recall, as I kept increasing my frequency here,", 
    "as frequency went up, my amplitude of V", 
    "kept going down, OK?", 
    "And that is directly explained by this magnitude of the", 
    "frequency response plot.", 
    "OK, so wrapping up my review of what we covered the last", 
    "time, let me also show you very quickly the second part", 
    "of the frequency response plot, which is called the", 
    "phase plot.", 
    "So here, I plot the phase.", 
    "And the phase is given by the angle of this", 
    "ratio, VP over VI.", 
    "And that is tan inverse minus omega RC, OK?", 
    "And begin a plot that is a function of omega.", 
    "And I show that here.", 
    "So notice that, for small omega, there is hardly any", 
    "phase difference with the input, OK?", 
    "The phase difference is zero.", 
    "However, if when I go to very, very large frequencies, I get", 
    "to large omega.", 
    "Then I get to a 90 degrees phase shift between VP and VI.", 
    "And of course, at the break frequency, there is a phase", 
    "shift of 45 degrees between VP and VI, all right?", 
    "So this should give you a quick sense of what we have", 
    "covered so far.", 
    "And then, in today's sequence, let's go in and try to see if", 
    "we can find an even simpler way of figuring out VP.", 
    "OK, recall VP, this is the boss, OK?", 
    "VP is the key here, the complex amplitude.", 
    "Can we find that in a more easy manner?", 
    "OK, hold onto your seats.", 
    "We will get to that next."
