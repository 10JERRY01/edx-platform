    "SPEAKER 1: So let's go take a look at what this gives us.", 
    "And let's try to intuitively plot out the transfer function", 
    "for this circuit.", 
    "And this case, let's try to plot out the magnitude of the", 
    "transfer function V0 over Vi and see what it looks like.", 
    "All right, so let's start with looking at what happens at", 
    "very low frequencies, so low omega.", 
    "So for very low frequencies, since I'm taking the voltage", 
    "across the inductor and capacitor pair connected in", 
    "parallel, for very low frequencies the inductor is a", 
    "short circuit.", 
    "The inductor being a short circuit implies that V0 across", 
    "the very low impedance is going to be very, very small.", 
    "So this is going to look like this.", 
    "It's going to be very low.", 
    "And this is because L, the inductor, behaves like a short", 
    "at this point.", 
    "What happens when the frequency is very high?", 
    "So for a high omega.", 
    "At high frequencies, the inductor", 
    "behaves like a open circuit.", 
    "But then the capacitor behaves like a short circuit to high", 
    "frequencies.", 
    "And because the capacitor behaves like a short to high", 
    "frequencies at large values of omega, I'm going to get a low", 
    "response at V0.", 
    "So this is C behaving like a short.", 
    "And then for intermediate values of frequencies where", 
    "both L and C have modest values and neither one of them", 
    "is close to zero impedance and both of them have modest", 
    "values, there I might see more modest value for V0 versus Vi.", 
    "so I'm going to get some function that looks like this.", 
    "It's very low for low frequencies, low for high", 
    "frequencies, and then this is a RLC circuit and you can", 
    "convince yourselves that for omega0 the function is going", 
    "to peak at some value.", 
    "So this kind of a filter is called a band", 
    "pass filter or BPF.", 
    "It's a band pass filter because it passes frequencies", 
    "in this band of omega0.", 
    "So when frequencies are not too low or too high, it passes", 
    "them and that's why it's a band pass.", 
    "In the next video, we're going to see a major, major", 
    "application of band pass filters and that", 
    "will be an AM radio.", 
    "And that will be coming up shortly.", 
    "So as a precursor to getting into the band pass action for", 
    "an AM radio, notice that here I have an L and C in parallel.", 
    "And by connecting them in parallel, they tend to", 
    "attenuate very low or very high frequencies about some", 
    "frequency omega0.", 
    "So I could choose omega0, and by the right choice of omega0", 
    "I can make frequencies that are distant from omega0 be", 
    "attenuated.", 
    "So I can get a band pass action around some omega0.", 
    "So let's dive in and take a look at an AM radio receiver.", 
    "So let's first look at the front end structure of an AM", 
    "radio receiver and then we'll look at how it works as a band", 
    "pass to enable you to tune to various frequencies where", 
    "different radio stations might be broadcasting.", 
    "So here is my little cartoon of an AM radio receiver.", 
    "Notice that on the left-hand side I", 
    "start off with an antenna.", 
    "And the antenna picks up the radio signal.", 
    "And that signal then falls across this LC circuit along", 
    "the lines of the one that we looked at.", 
    "So clearly this filter will do some band pass filter action.", 
    "And then the resulting signal will then be sent to other", 
    "forms of processing.", 
    "So we can model this as the following circuit.", 
    "So we need build some kind of a model for this antenna.", 
    "And let me write you a Thevenin", 
    "equivalent antenna model.", 
    "OK, so the Thevenin equivalent of my antenna is going to look", 
    "like a voltage source in series with a resistor.", 
    "Some voltage Vi, and this is again the amplitude of the set", 
    "of sinusoids coming in, and there's some resistance R. So", 
    "this is my Thevenin antenna model.", 
    "So I've modeled my antenna as a Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "Then following that, I have my LC components.", 
    "So that's my L and that is my C. Now notice that if you", 
    "recall radios, radios have a tuner because you need to be", 
    "able to tune to different frequencies.", 
    "And the way it is commonly done is that the capacitance", 
    "is made a variable capacitor.", 
    "It's a tunable capacitor.", 
    "By making it a tunable capacitor, I can pick the", 
    "center frequency omega0 at different places.", 
    "So you'll recall that omega0 is 1 by the square root of LC.", 
    "And so by choosing a value for capacitance, by tuning the", 
    "value of capacitance, I can make my center frequency", 
    "omega0 fall within some given range.", 
    "To flesh out the rest of the radio circuit, we won't go", 
    "into details, but later courses will show you what it", 
    "looks like.", 
    "We have a demodulator and we have an amplifier.", 
    "And then following that I may go to some kind of a speaker.", 
    "And then the speaker will give rise to sound.", 
    "So we won't to look at this step, I'm just going to focus", 
    "on the front end, which is the Thevenin equivalent combined", 
    "with the parallel LC.", 
    "This is very similar to the circuit that we just looked at", 
    "a few minutes ago.", 
    "So I just want to walk you through how the radio works", 
    "abstractly and then go on to some more examples."
