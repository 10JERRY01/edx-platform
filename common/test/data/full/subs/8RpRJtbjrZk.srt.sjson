    "SPEAKER 1: So I hope you have fun with that.", 
    "Just as a quick recap, what we did was we closed this switch,", 
    "and by closing the switch introduced the 50-ohm resistor", 
    "into the circuit in place of the 2K.", 
    "It was in parallel with the 2K so the effective resistance", 
    "was more or less 50 ohms. And so I expected to see a sharply", 
    "rising waveform.", 
    "But instead, I saw something absolutely crazy.", 
    "Let me draw that for your notes very quickly, and then", 
    "we can try to figure out what on earth is going on.", 
    "So this is what I expected.", 
    "This worked fine.", 
    "And then I had a low voltage here at VB.", 
    "It went up.", 
    "But here, things went haywire.", 
    "I expected to see a nice little well-behaved,", 
    "fast-rising waveform that looked like this.", 
    "That's what I expected.", 
    "But what I saw was something utterly crazy.", 
    "I saw something that looked like this.", 
    "That is what I saw.", 
    "I saw an oscillatory waveform that seemed to oscillate, and", 
    "then the oscillations decayed, and this was", 
    "with the 50-ohm resistor.", 
    "And then following here, I went down as expected, and", 
    "then I had 0 volts there.", 
    "This was absolutely crazy.", 
    "Now C is going absolutely nuts because of this, because at C,", 
    "what does the waveform look like?", 
    "All of this looks pretty good, and here, of course, because", 
    "VT is the threshold and VT is crossed very quickly, C goes", 
    "down very quickly.", 
    "But crazy things happen.", 
    "Notice that because this waveform here goes down and", 
    "potentially goes below the threshold voltage for the", 
    "input of VB, I might get some funky thing.", 
    "So let me just redraw this.", 
    "Let's say that this oscillation here went below", 
    "the threshold voltage for the node at B. So for the MOSFET", 
    "at B, this voltage went below the threshold voltage.", 
    "So what I would see here for C--", 
    "I would see a spike that looked like this.", 
    "For the little brief period that the voltage went below", 
    "VT, my MOSFET would shut off, and my output would go high,", 
    "and my behavior would look like this.", 
    "Not what I expect.", 
    "This is not what I want.", 
    "This is wrong.", 
    "Oops, you know what I should have done?", 
    "I should have drawn it in purple just to be consistent", 
    "with my color code here.", 
    "Let me just redo that for you.", 
    "Just change that to purple very quickly.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So that is not good.", 
    "And in fact, if these oscillations here were much", 
    "higher, I would get a whole bunch of ups and downs here,", 
    "and my whole circuit is simply not behaving like", 
    "I expected it to.", 
    "So what on earth is going on?", 
    "So before I show you the answer, you may want to hit", 
    "the pause button and think for yourself as to what", 
    "might be going on.", 
    "What magic is being unleashed here that is causing this", 
    "really, really funky behavior?", 
    "So, so far, we understand the steps and falling steps.", 
    "We understand rising waveforms like this and decaying", 
    "exponentials.", 
    "But nothing we have seen so far has prepared us for", 
    "waveforms forms that look like this.", 
    "Nothing we've seen so far is remotely close to", 
    "understanding this behavior.", 
    "So think about it.", 
    "And hit the pause button if you like.", 
    "And then we'll go on and look at what's going", 
    "on in the next step."
