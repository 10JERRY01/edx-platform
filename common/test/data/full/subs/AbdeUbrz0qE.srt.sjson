    "SPEAKER: All right.", 
    "Hope you had a chance to try out some complex algebra there", 
    "to figure out the magnitude and phase of this component in", 
    "brackets here.", 
    "And just to be very clear, this is the piece that we've", 
    "been calling the complex amplitude vP.", 
    "So let me go ahead and find out v, small v,", 
    "capital P for you.", 
    "This was the particular solution.", 
    "So this is the real part of Vi divided by 1 plus j omega RC", 
    "times e to the j omega t.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to rationalize the", 
    "denominator.", 
    "And I'm going to rationalize the denominator by multiplying", 
    "both the numerator and denominator by the complex", 
    "conjugate off 1 plus j omega RC.", 
    "By the way, if you want a refresher on complex analysis,", 
    "I have an appendix for you in the textbook.", 
    "You can go and refresh your knowledge of complex analysis", 
    "in the appendix in the textbook.", 
    "So I'm going to multiply the numerator and denominator by", 
    "the complex conjugate of the value in the denominator.", 
    "And so I'm going to get the complex conjugate is 1", 
    "minus j omega RC.", 
    "I'm going to multiply 1 plus j omega RC times 1 minus j omega", 
    "RC, I get 1 plus omega squared R squared C squared.", 
    "And in the numerator I get Vi times the complex conjugate 1", 
    "minus j omega RC.", 
    "And this times e raised to j omega t.", 
    "So next what I'm going to do is I'm going to", 
    "express this quantity.", 
    "When I take magnitude and phrase, it's good to express", 
    "these complex numbers in their polar form.", 
    "And, again, the appendix will show you how to convert this", 
    "into polar form.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is real part again.", 
    "That stays the same.", 
    "And so I would express Vi times 1 minus j omega RC", 
    "divided by 1 plus omega squared R squared C squared in", 
    "its magnitude and phase representation.", 
    "And that will be--", 
    "I'm skipping a set of steps here--", 
    "that's going to be one plus omega squared R squared C", 
    "squared square root of the whole thing times e raised to", 
    "j phi times e raised to j omega t, where phi is tan", 
    "inverse of minus omega RC or tan phi is minus omega RC.", 
    "So I've represented this in its phase magnitude form.", 
    "And then it becomes pretty easy to then take the real", 
    "part of the magnitude and phase.", 
    "So let me combine these two values here.", 
    "So I get Vi square root of 1 plus omega squared R squared C", 
    "squared times e raised to j omega t plus phi.", 
    "So I am almost done.", 
    "So vP is the phase--", 
    "I'm sorry, vP is the magnitude.", 
    "And then I can also write down the phase.", 
    "So this part here.", 
    "What exactly is this part in the", 
    "relationship to capital vP?", 
    "This is the magnitude of vP.", 
    "And this phi thing here is the phase of vP, this angle of vP.", 
    "So finally I can write down this as the magnitude here.", 
    "So 1 plus omega squared R squared C squared.", 
    "That's my magnitude.", 
    "So that is the magnitude of vP, my", 
    "complex amplitude, times--", 
    "the real part of this is what?", 
    "[UNINTELLIGIBLE] by the relationship, that is simply", 
    "sine omega t plus phi plus j times cosine--", 
    "I'm sorry.", 
    "It is cosine omega t plus phi plus j times sine", 
    "omega t plus phi.", 
    "And the real part of that is simply cosine of omega t plus", 
    "phi, where phi is angle vP.", 
    "And that is given by tan inverse of omega RC.", 
    "So there you have it.", 
    "So on this page here I've simply worked", 
    "on a bunch of math.", 
    "And I've obtained vP, which was my particular response to", 
    "Vi cosine omega t by taking the real part of the response", 
    "to the sneaky input.", 
    "So notice that both the magnitude of vP and the phase", 
    "of vP I obtained directly from the complex amplitude here.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "It's a very important point to remember.", 
    "Let me write that down in green.", 
    "So notice I got these, and in this case it is this and this,", 
    "directly from this.", 
    "So what this is saying is that once I was able to compute my", 
    "complex amplitude vP, then I could very quickly get my real", 
    "particular response by just taking the magnitude of the", 
    "complex amplitude.", 
    "And that's my amplitude here.", 
    "And then I obtain the phase out here.", 
    "So that was pretty straightforward.", 
    "And just a bunch of math.", 
    "And I was able to very quickly get my particular response.", 
    "So as a very quick summary, I used a sneaky input.", 
    "I found a response, vPs to the sneaky input.", 
    "And then the amplitude of that response was here, vP equals", 
    "Vi divided by 1 plus sRC, where s was j omega.", 
    "And then I took the real part of vPs, which was vP times e", 
    "raised to j omega t to the real part of that.", 
    "And most of this math here will simply take the", 
    "real part of vPs.", 
    "And I very quickly got my answer here.", 
    "So I had a bit of slightly messy complex algebra.", 
    "But no trick.", 
    "I very quickly obtained the response and then obtained the", 
    "real part of the response."
