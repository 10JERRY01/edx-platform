    "SPEAKER: Next, let me tie up some loose ends and cover a", 
    "couple of more topics before I move on to the next sequence.", 
    "So here I'd like to talk about a couple of plots, both I can", 
    "draw a magnitude plot for the output.", 
    "And I can also plot a phase plot for the output.", 
    "So what I'm going to do is rather than plot the actual", 
    "magnitude, we plot the transfer function.", 
    "So much like we have a transfer function, the output", 
    "voltage divided by the input voltage, as we saw in", 
    "amplifiers and so on in time domain, we can also have a", 
    "transfer function in the frequency domain.", 
    "So as you recall, on the right-hand side here, vp is a", 
    "function of Vi.", 
    "It's Vi divided by 1 plus sRC, where s is j omega.", 
    "And Vi was the amplitude of the input.", 
    "So recall my input is Vi cosine of omega t.", 
    "And my output is related to the magnitude of vp.", 
    "So I can plot vp divided by Vi as a transfer function.", 
    "So I can write down the following.", 
    "I can write down H of j omega, H for transfer function, as vp", 
    "divided by Vi.", 
    "Again, this is the little trapezoidal thing that we've", 
    "had so far.", 
    "So that is H of j omega.", 
    "And, commonly, I like to plot the magnitude of that.", 
    "So the magnitude of H of--", 
    "I can plot both the magnitude and phase of H of j omega.", 
    "And so the magnitude of that will be the", 
    "magnitude of vp over Vi.", 
    "And so this is given by vp divided by Vi is equal to 1 by", 
    "square root of 1 plus omega squared R squared C squared.", 
    "This is simply the magnitude of this little", 
    "component here divided--", 
    "I've taken away Vi to the left-hand side.", 
    "That's the j omega.", 
    "So the magnitude of 1 divided by 1 plus j omega RC is 1", 
    "divided by the square root of 1 plus omega", 
    "squared R squared C squared.", 
    "So I can plot that.", 
    "And so let me go ahead and show you what a plot of that", 
    "might look like.", 
    "So we draw these plots as a function--", 
    "it's a frequency plot.", 
    "It's a transfer function, which is plotted as a function", 
    "of frequency.", 
    "So I could plot that as a function of", 
    "omega, the angular frequency.", 
    "And so here I'm going to plot the magnitude of the transfer", 
    "function, vp over Vi.", 
    "And generally we plot this on a log log scale.", 
    "So when I plot this, the transfer function is going to", 
    "look something like this.", 
    "So notice here--", 
    "to stare at this for a second.", 
    "Notice that when omega is 0, when omega is very small, this", 
    "is approximately 1.", 
    "So it starts off at 1.", 
    "And finally when omega is very, very large, then omega", 
    "squared R squared C squared is much greater than 1.", 
    "And so I can ignore the 1.", 
    "And so in the other case it becomes approximately equal to", 
    "1 by omega RC.", 
    "And so in a log plot, 1 by omega RC is a negative-sloping", 
    "straight line.", 
    "So it looked like something like this.", 
    "And then if you look at--", 
    "think of the point here.", 
    "So what this will look like is something", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "And that is an inflection point here.", 
    "What is an inflection point?", 
    "So that inflection point is when the magnitude, when omega", 
    "RC, is equal to 1.", 
    "So this inflection point happens at omega equals 1 by", 
    "RC because at that point, when omega RC is equal to 1, I get", 
    "these sides equal to each other.", 
    "And so I get 1 by square root 2 of the magnitude.", 
    "So it's 1 by square root 2.", 
    "So the magnitude here is 1 by square root 2 of the initial", 
    "magnitude, 1.", 
    "So this frequency is called the break frequency, the", 
    "frequency at which the output falls to 1 over square root of", 
    "2 of the initial value.", 
    "So right here this should give you a bunch of insight into", 
    "the behavior of the demo that you saw at the beginning of", 
    "this sequence.", 
    "So notice that at low frequencies the sinusoids go", 
    "through unchanged.", 
    "However, as the frequency of the sinusoids increase, notice", 
    "that the attitude begins to drop pretty significantly.", 
    "So hopefully now this explains the demo to you, where the", 
    "demo for low frequencies my output was pretty much similar", 
    "to the input.", 
    "But as my frequency increased, my output amplitude kept", 
    "becoming smaller and smaller.", 
    "So let me just write down that little note here.", 
    "So as frequencies become larger and larger, my", 
    "magnitude of the output response kept", 
    "getting lower and lower.", 
    "And that comes directly from this frequency response.", 
    "So H of j omega is called the frequency response.", 
    "It's the magnitude component of the frequency response.", 
    "And it is plotting the magnitude of the transfer", 
    "function, vp over Vi.", 
    "Now I use the term frequency response.", 
    "Let me write that down and tell you what that is.", 
    "We'll look at this in more detail in the", 
    "next couple of sequences.", 
    "But when I say frequency response, I'm talking about", 
    "two things.", 
    "I'm talking about a magnitude plot.", 
    "And I'm talking about a phase plot.", 
    "And I'll show you the phase plot in a second.", 
    "So the frequency response of a circuit, such as the series", 
    "capacitor as a resistor circuit, has both a magnitude", 
    "plot and a phase plot.", 
    "And the magnitude plot is the magnitude as", 
    "a function of frequency.", 
    "And this phase plot is the phase as", 
    "a function of frequency.", 
    "So let's go ahead and plot the phase next.", 
    "So my phase is given by 10 inverse of minus omega RC.", 
    "Much like a plot of the magnitude, I", 
    "can plot the phase.", 
    "And in this case, let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So, again, I plot this with respect omega.", 
    "And phi is angle vp divided by Vi.", 
    "It's the phase component of the frequency response.", 
    "Let me summarize that here as well.", 
    "So frequency response has two components.", 
    "Has a magnitude plot and a phase plot.", 
    "So I' going to ask you, hey, show me the frequency response", 
    "of the circuit.", 
    "You find out the output that the user cares about.", 
    "And find out the magnitude plot of the output with", 
    "respect to the input.", 
    "And find the phase plot with the same output with respect", 
    "to the input.", 
    "And that's your frequency response.", 
    "It has two plots.", 
    "So let me go ahead and plot this for you.", 
    "So here it is tan inverse of minus omega RC.", 
    "And let me again plot this on a log scale .", 
    "But the phase itself, the y-axis, will", 
    "be on a linear scale.", 
    "Interesting things happen at the break frequency.", 
    "So it's omega equals 1 divided by RC.", 
    "When omega equals 1 divided by RC, notice that", 
    "omega RC becomes 1.", 
    "So tan inverse of minus 1 is 45 degrees or pi by 4.", 
    "So out there it's minus 1.", 
    "So it's minus pi by 4.", 
    "Tan inverse of 0 is 0.", 
    "So this is what I have here.", 
    "And then when omega becomes very, very large, then, in", 
    "that case, my phase becomes minus pi by 2.", 
    "So my phase is here.", 
    "When omega is very small, the phase is 0.", 
    "So it's going to look something like this.", 
    "So phase starts off at 0.", 
    "For very high omega, it goes to minus pi by 2.", 
    "And then when omega equals 1 by RC, my phase", 
    "is minus pi by 4.", 
    "So this is the phase plot of the frequency response.", 
    "So let me pause there and have you do a quick", 
    "little concept exercise.", 
    "And then I would like to very quickly summarize and give you", 
    "a preview of some pretty spectacular upcoming", 
    "attractions."
