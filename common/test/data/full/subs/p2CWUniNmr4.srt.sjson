    "SPEAKER: Very quickly, without hysteresis, I can show you the", 
    "same waveform where, if I had some input that looked like", 
    "this and, without hysteresis, my op amp output would have", 
    "gone haywire in the following manner.", 
    "OK, I would come up here.", 
    "Notice that I touch zero here, so this shot up.", 
    "And then I come negative again.", 
    "And I touch zero again.", 
    "So my output would have looked like this.", 
    "And this is undesired behavior.", 
    "And so this is what I would have gotten without", 
    "hysteresis.", 
    "So this would be Vi, and this would be Vo.", 
    "And that would not be a good thing, OK?", 
    "So in my analog to digital world, I may have wanted to", 
    "get a nice little zero 1 signal that very cleanly", 
    "looked like a zero to a 1 transition.", 
    "But here, I get a much more messy signal.", 
    "OK, I should have continued drawing it up here and", 
    "continued it down this way.", 
    "OK, V naught.", 
    "So these glitches at the transition point are not all", 
    "that good because, if this is zero, this is", 
    "zero, this is a 1.", 
    "But notice here I get a 1 zero, 1 zero, a bit of a messy", 
    "signal sequence.", 
    "And that's what would have happened if I didn't have the", 
    "hysteresis in my circuit.", 
    "OK, so now let's take a look at another fun circuit called", 
    "the oscillator.", 
    "Again, circuits like this can be used to build", 
    "what we call a clock.", 
    "So before we look at what clocks are useful for, let's", 
    "try to build an oscillator.", 
    "OK, an oscillator is a circuit that oscillates back and forth", 
    "by itself between high voltage and a zero voltage.", 
    "We'll call it high voltage and a low voltage.", 
    "It sits there going back and forth, boom, boom, boom, boom,", 
    "boom, high, low, high, low, high, low, VS, minus VS, VS,", 
    "minus VS and just sits there oscillating, OK?", 
    "And there are many fun uses for a circuit like that.", 
    "OK, let's build a circuit and then talk about some", 
    "applications of a oscillator.", 
    "In this fun circuit, I would apply both negative and", 
    "positive feedback.", 
    "OK, let me start with what you've seen before and apply", 
    "some positive feedback using a usual R and R voltage", 
    "divider like so.", 
    "OK, since R and R are equal, then the voltage at my", 
    "positive input is simply going to V naught divided by 2.", 
    "OK, I'm going to do some fun stuff at", 
    "the negative terminal.", 
    "OK, at the negative terminal, I am going", 
    "to build a RC circuit.", 
    "So let me go with the resistor R here, and let me build a", 
    "capacitor here.", 
    "OK, I'm going to add a capacitor, C, out there.", 
    "And the voltage across the capacitor, let me", 
    "denote that as VC.", 
    "OK, so let's stare at the circuit for a little bit and", 
    "see how the circuit might behave before I actually go", 
    "and analyze the circuit for you.", 
    "So if you look at this circuit, the state of the", 
    "circuit, so the output is V naught.", 
    "And my plus V plus terminal voltage is V", 
    "naught divided by 2.", 
    "So let's say my life starts out with V naught being at", 
    "plus 15 volts.", 
    "OK let's, without loss of generality, assume that V", 
    "naught is at plus 15 volts.", 
    "So this is 15.", 
    "And the plus terminal is at 7.5.", 
    "Let's say life starts out for the capacitor where the", 
    "capacitor is at zero volts.", 
    "OK, I connect the capacitor.", 
    "I build the circuit.", 
    "Boom, my capacitor has zero volts.", 
    "Let's say, because of noise or whatever else, the op amp", 
    "starts off at 15 volts at the output.", 
    "What happens?", 
    "If the op amp is 15 volts at the output and the capacitor", 
    "is at zero, instantaneously, there will be a current that", 
    "will begin to flow through R, OK?", 
    "It will be 15, since the V minus is at zero.", 
    "15 volts minus zero volts is 15 volts.", 
    "So there will be a current that will start in the", 
    "direction from V naught to V minus, which would be given by", 
    "15 volts over R.", 
    "Now that current can't go anywhere, OK?", 
    "Notice that I cannot go into the minus terminal because", 
    "it's infinite resistance.", 
    "And so that current, 15 volts divided by R, has nowhere to", 
    "go, but it's going to start charging up the capacitor.", 
    "So that current is going to start", 
    "charging up the capacitor.", 
    "And as it charges up the capacitor, the voltage VC is", 
    "going to build up.", 
    "OK, recall the hysteresis in this little package here.", 
    "This is 7.5 volts, OK?", 
    "So recall this is at 7.5 volts.", 
    "Nothing is going to happen until the minus terminal", 
    "reaches 7.5 volts.", 
    "So as the capacitor starts charging up, it eventually", 
    "charges to 7.5 volts, OK?", 
    "And when it charges to 7.5 volts and exceeds it ever so", 
    "slightly, boom, I'm going to have a negative voltage on the", 
    "V plus minus V minus terminal pair, and the output is going", 
    "to switch negative.", 
    "Output switches negative.", 
    "And I'm going to have a negative 7.5 volts now at the", 
    "plus terminal, OK?", 
    "The capacitor is at plus 7.5.", 
    "Output is at minus 15.", 
    "So in this case, what's going to happen is that, because the", 
    "output is at minus 15 volts, the current is now going to", 
    "flow in the right-hand direction, OK?", 
    "So the capacitor is going to start discharging now because", 
    "this has switched from plus 15, which is charging the", 
    "capacitor, to minus 15 that will begin", 
    "discharging the capacitor.", 
    "So as the capacitor begins to discharge and this voltage", 
    "here will start going more and more negative, ultimately,", 
    "this voltage gets to minus 7.5 volts, in which case this", 
    "switches to plus 15.", 
    "It switches to plus 15 and begins to charge up the", 
    "capacitor again, and so on and so forth.", 
    "And the world goes on.", 
    "And so you can see how this voltage, V naught, will be", 
    "switching back and forth from plus 15 to minus 15 as the", 
    "capacitor charges and discharges here.", 
    "OK, so that was a quick rundown, intuitively, as to", 
    "how this circuit behaves.", 
    "But what I'd like to do next is then walk you through the", 
    "mechanics and the equations of what is happening here."
