    "SPEAKER: Now let's write down an algebraic", 
    "expression for Vc over Vi.", 
    "And you will see some really, really fun stuff.", 
    "This will get to your next big aha moment for this course.", 
    "All right, I'm going to switch back to a notation we've used", 
    "pretty consistently, which is the shorthand", 
    "notation s for j omega.", 
    "So in terms of s, recall the impedance for L is sL.", 
    "And the impedance for the capacitor C is one by sC.", 
    "And that for R is R as usual.", 
    "OK, so let me go ahead and write down the transfer", 
    "function Vc over Vi and see some fun stuff", 
    "that happens at resonance.", 
    "This will be a completely mind-numbing experience when", 
    "you see what results.", 
    "So using a usual voltage divider action for impedances,", 
    "the voltage Vc over Vi, the response across the capacitor", 
    "will be the capacitor impedance, 1 by sC divided by", 
    "the sum of all the impedances.", 
    "The sum of all the impedances will simply be--", 
    "let's see.", 
    "I have sL for the inductor.", 
    "I have 1 by s-- let me just use", 
    "small s, the same notation.", 
    "1 by sC for the capacitor.", 
    "And R for the resistor.", 
    "Let me just muck around with the terms a little bit and", 
    "multiply both the numerator and denominator with sC.", 
    "So I get 1 in the numerator and I get sC times sL is s", 
    "squared LC.", 
    "sC times 1 divided by sC is simply 1.", 
    "And then I get sRC for the final term.", 
    "Let me continue simplifying this a little bit more and", 
    "express it in some reasonable form.", 
    "So what I'm going to do next is divide both sides by LC, so", 
    "that I can get s squared all by itself.", 
    "So if I divide the numerator and denominator but LC, here's", 
    "what I get.", 
    "So I get s squared here.", 
    "And then, I get plus 1 by LC.", 
    "And then here I get sRC divided by LC becomes s times", 
    "R divided by L.", 
    "Then, I'm going to substitute for LC in terms of omega 0.", 
    "Notice here, omega 0 equals 1 by square root of LC.", 
    "And so therefore, 1 divided by LC is simply omega 0 squared.", 
    "So I get omega 0 squared here for 1 divided by LC.", 
    "My s squared stays the same.", 
    "I'm going to shuffle terms around a little. bit.", 
    "I want to stick the omega 0 squared out here for the 1", 
    "divided by LC term.", 
    "And out here I'm simply going to leave it as s R divided by", 
    "L. So that wasn't too hard.", 
    "Finally, I'm going to express this in standard form.", 
    "Notice here that 2 alpha was equal to R divided by L. You", 
    "recall we encountered alpha and omega 0 when we did time", 
    "domain analysis, and for the series RLC circuit, alpha was", 
    "equal to R divided by 2L.", 
    "So therefore, R divided by L is 2 alpha.", 
    "So in terms of that same old 2 alpha, I can express Vc over", 
    "Vi as omega 0 squared divided by s squared plus 2 alpha s.", 
    "2 alpha s because R divided by L is 2 alpha.", 
    "Plus omega 0 squared.", 
    "So I've expressed my Vc over Vi in this, more or less,", 
    "canonic representation.", 
    "Let me point again to the expression in the denominator,", 
    "s squared plus 2 alpha s plus omega 0 squared.", 
    "Recall that was the characteristic equation for", 
    "the series RLC circuit.", 
    "So here is an example where using the impedance method you", 
    "can very quickly get the characteristic equation", 
    "without having to write any differential equations.", 
    "So now let the fun begin.", 
    "Are you ready?", 
    "Let's jump in and do it.", 
    "So let's see what happens.", 
    "So you know that s is j omega.", 
    "So you know that s is j omega by our notation.", 
    "So let's find out what happens when at omega equals omega 0.", 
    "Let's take a look at what happens to my response Vc over", 
    "Vi at s equals omega 0.", 
    "So let me write that down here.", 
    "So Vc over Vi at s equals j omega 0.", 
    "What happens to Vc over Vi at resonance?", 
    "So, let me go ahead and substitute 4s in", 
    "terms of j omega 0.", 
    "So I'm going to stick s equals j omega 0 in", 
    "the expression above.", 
    "So I get omega 0 squared.", 
    "That doesn't change.", 
    "So s is j omega 0.", 
    "So I'm going to get j omega 0 squared out here.", 
    "And let me just shuffle things around.", 
    "Let me move the omega 0 squared right here.", 
    "And then let me write down 2 alpha s where s is j omega 0.", 
    "Do you see a pattern emerging here?", 
    "So what happens here?", 
    "Notice that j omega 0 squared plus omega 0", 
    "squared cancel out.", 
    "j squared is minus, so this was results in minus omega 0", 
    "squared plus omega 0 squared.", 
    "So lo and behold, these two things cancel out.", 
    "Let me switch colors here, so that you can really focus on", 
    "something really, really fun.", 
    "So here I cancel out j omega 0, the whole squared, and", 
    "omega 0 squared.", 
    "So what I'm left with is omega 0 squared divided by 2", 
    "alpha j omega 0.", 
    "Now if I take the magnitude--", 
    "let's focus on the magnitude here.", 
    "Vc over Vi, let we take the magnitude.", 
    "If i take the magnitude, what do I get?", 
    "If I take the magnitude, this j will vanish.", 
    "But I'm left with omega 0 squared divided by", 
    "2 alpha omega 0.", 
    "And omega 0 cancels out with one of the", 
    "omega 0's in the numerator.", 
    "So I get omega 0 divide by 2 alpha."
