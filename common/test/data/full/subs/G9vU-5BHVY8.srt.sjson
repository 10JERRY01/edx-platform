    "SPEAKER: OK, in the previous video, we looked at the static", 
    "power for the MOSFET gate, that is, when the inputs were", 
    "a 0 or a 1.", 
    "Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a slightly", 
    "different example.", 
    "In this example, I'm going to lead up towards how to compute", 
    "the dynamic power of the inverter.", 
    "That is when the input to the inverter is switching between", 
    "1's and 0's.", 
    "Now, doing that for the inverter directly is a little", 
    "more complicated than that I'd like.", 
    "And so I'm going to start with a much simpler circuit and", 
    "build up intuition in terms of how to compute the power that", 
    "gets dissipated because I'm switching a capacitor,", 
    "charging and discharging a capacitor.", 
    "So the circuit that I'm going to use is", 
    "going to be the following.", 
    "I take a voltage source, a VS. I'm going to connect that to a", 
    "switch, S1.", 
    "And then I'm going to connect that to a resistor, R1.", 
    "And that, in turn, will connect to a capacitor with", 
    "capacitance C and complete the circuit", 
    "for the voltage source.", 
    "Then I take the connection between the resistor R1 and", 
    "the capacitor and connect it to a second switch, S2, which,", 
    "in turn, will go to another resistor and then connect that", 
    "back, like so, a resistance R2.", 
    "All right, what I'm going to do next is I'm going to switch", 
    "switches S1 and S2 in the following manner.", 
    "I'm going to first switch S1 on and S2 off.", 
    "So I'll switch S1 on first and S2 off.", 
    "So by doing so, I'm going to charge up the capacitor.", 
    "Then what I'll do is I'll switch off S1 and turn S2 on", 
    "so that the capacitor now, because S2 is turned on and S1", 
    "is off, this capacitor will discharge through R2.", 
    "So notice what I've done.", 
    "In the first phase, I'm going to charge up the capacitor", 
    "from VS. Notice S2 is open, so nothing happens to that part", 
    "of the circuit.", 
    "So then I charge up the capacitor.", 
    "Then I turn S2 on and turn S1 off.", 
    "And that will cause my capacitor to discharge, so", 
    "charging and discharging the capacitor in sequence.", 
    "And in order to do so, let me plot for you the sequence so", 
    "that it becomes quite clear what I'm going", 
    "to do with the switches.", 
    "So here's what I'm going to do.", 
    "So I'm going to turn my switches on", 
    "and off in the sequence.", 
    "First, I'm going to turn on S1.", 
    "So S1 is going to be closed during this interval, T1.", 
    "I call that interval T1.", 
    "And in the same interval, S2 will be open.", 
    "S1 closed, S2 open, like I showed you earlier.", 
    "Then in my second interval of interval of time T2, I'm going", 
    "to do the opposite.", 
    "S1 will be opened, and S2 will be closed.", 
    "So I'm going to switch S1 and S2 on and", 
    "off, like shown here.", 
    "And the cycle will simply repeat.", 
    "This time period is T.", 
    "And for subsequent time periods, I'm going to follow", 
    "the same pattern--", 
    "S1 closed, S2 open, S1 open, S2 closed, and so on.", 
    "So with time period T, and if the frequency f of is 1/T,", 
    "with frequency f, I'm going to do this alternative switching", 
    "of my switches, as I've shown here.", 
    "And my goal will be to find out a couple of things.", 
    "One goal will be to find the energy", 
    "dissipated in each cycle.", 
    "What is the energy dissipated in each cycle", 
    "of time period T?", 
    "And the second thing will be to find the average power.", 
    "For the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] circuit, where I have a little", 
    "switch to capacitor--", 
    "I'm switching the capacitor on and off-- let me find out what", 
    "the energy dissipated in each cycle is and what", 
    "the power is as well.", 
    "So I have two periods, T1 and T2.", 
    "So let me go ahead and start with T1.", 
    "And let's see what is the energy dissipated in T1.", 
    "And then we'll go to T2.", 
    "So this is my circuit.", 
    "In this case, I've shown both the switches open.", 
    "And I'm going to consider the first case, S1", 
    "closed and S2 open.", 
    "So notice here that S1 is dutifully closed, and S2 is", 
    "open, as I had suggested.", 
    "So the equivalent circuit in this situation, with the", 
    "switches as shown, this is what I'm going to see.", 
    "My equivalent circuit for analysis will be here's my VS.", 
    "And because S1 is closed, and S1 one is an ideal switch--", 
    "so let's say switches are ideal.", 
    "So they behave like a short circuit when", 
    "they're turned on.", 
    "And so therefore, it will just look like a wire.", 
    "So here's my resistance R1.", 
    "And here's my capacitance C. And I complete the circuit.", 
    "Let us say that the current to the circuit is going to be", 
    "some i of T. It's a resistor and capacitor, so the", 
    "capacitor is going to charge up as some function of T. And", 
    "let's say that the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor will be vC.", 
    "And it's really vC of T at some function of time.", 
    "So let's go ahead and try to compute the energy that I am", 
    "going to dissipate in this little circuit when my switch", 
    "S1 is closed and S2 is open.", 
    "As I promised, S1 is shorted here, and S2 is open here.", 
    "So as I said earlier, this is my equivalent circuit, where I", 
    "have some current i flowing through the circuit and the", 
    "switch behaves like a short circuit.", 
    "Further, since I'm starting out here, let me make some", 
    "assumptions about what's on the capacitor when I'm", 
    "starting out.", 
    "So let's assume the capacitor's at rest, assume", 
    "that vC, the voltage across the capacitor, is 0 at", 
    "time T equals 0.", 
    "So let's take a look at the behavior of the various", 
    "voltages and currents in the circuit.", 
    "So let me plot.", 
    "So as I mentioned, vC is going to start out at 0.", 
    "That's my initial condition on the capacitor.", 
    "It starts off at 0.", 
    "So what do you think?", 
    "Here's my RC circuit.", 
    "And as a function of time, the capacitor's", 
    "going to charge up.", 
    "And might note the initial value.", 
    "What's the final value?", 
    "As the capacitor keeps charging up, it looks like a", 
    "long-term open circuit.", 
    "VS will completely charge up the capacitor.", 
    "And after a long period of time, its final value is going", 
    "to settle down at VS And it's going to have some rising", 
    "transient that look like this.", 
    "So the form of that rising transient will be 1 minus e", 
    "raised to minus T over the time constant.", 
    "What are the time constant for this circuit?", 
    "Well, it's R1C.", 
    "I'll just say the form is as shown here.", 
    "It's 1 minus e raised to minus T over R1C as a form of the", 
    "wave form across wave form vC.", 
    "Similarly, I can plot the current i.", 
    "The current i in this circuit is going to look like this.", 
    "We'll do our usual trick, starting current, final", 
    "current, and then connect it up with an exponential.", 
    "Remember, for RC circuits, I get exponentials that look", 
    "like this or look like this.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "There's two forms.", 
    "So the current, when I start off life and I just turn the", 
    "switch on instantaneously, the capacitor looks", 
    "like a short circuit.", 
    "The capacitor's an instantaneous short.", 
    "Recall, the voltage across the capacitor is 0.", 
    "And the voltage at this node is VS.", 
    "And so therefore, instantaneously, I'm going to", 
    "have a current through the circuits.", 
    "That's VS divided by R1.", 
    "So this is 0 here, and this is 0 here.", 
    "I'm going to start off life with current VS divided by R1.", 
    "What about at time T equals infinity?", 
    "After a long period of time, the circuit will come to rest,", 
    "because vC will charge up to VS and then no more", 
    "current will flow.", 
    "So after a long period of time, I'm going to have my", 
    "current going down to 0.", 
    "And then I'll just connect it up with a decaying", 
    "exponential.", 
    "And the form of that is e raised to minus T over the", 
    "time constant R1C.", 
    "So in this case, the current is going to start off at VS", 
    "divided by R1.", 
    "So I'm going to stick VS divided by R1 here.", 
    "So that is the equation for the decaying exponential,", 
    "which is the current.", 
    "OK, so this gives me a quick sense of what the current", 
    "through the capacitor is going to look like.", 
    "And in the next step, what I'm going to do is compute the", 
    "total energy supplied by the source.", 
    "I'm going to compute the total energy provided or supplied by", 
    "the source between time interval T1 in my circuit.", 
    "So what is that energy?", 
    "So the energy e is simply--", 
    "let me back up here.", 
    "In the previous case, when the power being dissipated by the", 
    "circuit was a constant, my energy was simply the power", 
    "times the time interval.", 
    "The energy was the power times the time interval, over which", 
    "the power was dissipated, given that", 
    "the power was a constant.", 
    "In this case, since my voltages and currents are time", 
    "varying, the instantaneous power--", 
    "instantaneous power--", 
    "is given by--", 
    "in other words, instantaneous power being supplied by VS", 
    "Instantaneous power be supplied by source, by the", 
    "voltage source, is going to be VS times i.", 
    "The voltage times the current is my instantaneous power.", 
    "So what's the energy?", 
    "The energy will simply be the time integral of the", 
    "instantaneous power over that interval of time.", 
    "So the instantaneous power is VS times i.", 
    "And I will integrate that from 0 to T1 dt.", 
    "So that is my energy supplied by the source.", 
    "This is the energy supplied by source. e is", 
    "energy supplied by source.", 
    "So energy supplied by the source will be integral of VSi", 
    "over the interval T1.", 
    "So I'd like you to develop this integral yourself and", 
    "figure out what e is.", 
    "I'm going to give you a little exercise where you can try it", 
    "out for yourselves.", 
    "And then we'll come back and solve it in the next video.", 
    "So go ahead and give it a shot."
