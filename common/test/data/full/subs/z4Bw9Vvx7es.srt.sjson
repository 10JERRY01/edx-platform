    "PROFESSOR: Let&#39;s move on from\nhere, now that we&#39;ve seen the", 
    "Thevenin pattern.", 
    "What I&#39;d like to do is continue\nanalyzing this a", 
    "little bit more.", 
    "As I said earlier, the Thevenin\npattern replaces the", 
    "arbitrary network, N. And VTH\nhere in the Thevenin network", 
    "is simply the open circuit\nvoltage seen at", 
    "the terminal pair.", 
    "In other words, if I looked\nat network N and I simply", 
    "measured the voltage at the\nterminal pair, it has to be an", 
    "open circuit voltage.", 
    "That is, without anything\nconnected there, then whatever", 
    "voltage I measure there would\nbe the Thevenin voltage.", 
    "Notice that you can see\nthe same thing here.", 
    "If I measure the voltage at\nthat point, without any", 
    "external excitation, with an\nopen circuit here, then VTH", 
    "would directly appear at the\nterminal, and I would be able", 
    "to measure the Thevenin\nvoltage.", 
    "Similarly, what is RTH ?", 
    "RTH is simply the resistance\nof the network seen at the", 
    "terminal there, with all the\nvoltages, Vm&#39;s, and all the", 
    "currents, In&#39;s, set to 0.", 
    "In other words, the way you\ncan find the Thevenin", 
    "resistance of a network is\nsimply set all the voltages", 
    "engines and all the currents\nto 0, and then go ahead and", 
    "simply measure the resistance\nlooking into", 
    "that terminal pair.", 
    "And that will give you RTH.", 
    "Again, as a quick summary, given\nany network n, and this", 
    "case a network with independent\nvoltage and", 
    "current sources, I can find a\nThevenin equivalent which", 
    "comprises a Thevenin\nvoltage, VTH, and a", 
    "resistance, RTH, as follows.", 
    "I open-circuit the connection.", 
    "In other words, I don&#39;t connect\nanything to the", 
    "terminal pair when I&#39;m measuring\nthe voltage V. I", 
    "measure the open circuit\nvoltage there,", 
    "and that is my VTH.", 
    "Then I turn off all my current\nsources and voltage sources", 
    "inside the network N, and simply\nmeasure its resistance.", 
    "And that is RTH.", 
    "So that&#39;s how I can get RTH\nand VTH by measurement.", 
    "And for the purpose of computing\nsome property such", 
    "as the voltage when an external\nexcitation is", 
    "applied, I can use those values\nof VTH and RTH to", 
    "replace the entire arbitrary\nnetwork N with this Thevenin", 
    "equivalent pattern.", 
    "This is a very, very powerful\ntechnique, and we will see", 
    "some examples of this shortly.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So we are ready to define\nthe Thevenin method.", 
    "So in the Thevenin method, you\nare given some network N,", 
    "maybe a horrendous network with\na whole bunch of voltage", 
    "sources and current sources\nand resistors and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "And you have some\nother external", 
    "network, E. E for external.", 
    "Then what I can do is, by the\nThevenin method, I can break", 
    "this down into a simpler\nproblem as follows.", 
    "What I would do as a first step\nis I would replace the", 
    "network N with this Thevenin\nequivalent.", 
    "And then as my second step, I\nwould solve with the external", 
    "network, E.", 
    "So in other words, what I would\ndo is I would replace", 
    "the network N with its Thevenin\nequivalent as my", 
    "first step.", 
    "And then I would go ahead and\nsolve with the external", 
    "network E in my second step.", 
    "And notice that I can compute\nRTH and VTH for the Thevenin", 
    "equivalent using the discussion\nfrom a few minutes", 
    "ago, where I can measure it by\nmeasuring the open circuit", 
    "voltage and the effective\nresistance of the network with", 
    "all sources turned off.", 
    "Or I can also compute it by\nusing superposition and", 
    "turning off each of the\nvoltages one by one.", 
    "I can do it in either way.", 
    "So this is the Thevenin\nmethod.", 
    "Again, as a first step, I\nreplace the network N with a", 
    "Thevenin equivalent, and then\nI solve for the external", 
    "network, E.", 
    "Now you might wonder,\nwhen is this useful?", 
    "So it turns out that in many\ncases where all you&#39;re", 
    "interested in is some value, V\nfor example, and you don&#39;t", 
    "really care about what&#39;s going\non inside this horrendous", 
    "network N, then you can\nsimplify your life", 
    "tremendously by replacing that\nentire network with its", 
    "Thevenin equivalent, and then\nsolving the circuit for the", 
    "voltage V based on that\nThevenin equivalent.", 
    "Again, this is a process where\nwe divide up the problem into", 
    "two simpler components, finding\na Thevenin and then", 
    "solving the resulting circuit.", 
    "So let us now move on to an\nexample and go to our old", 
    "faithful little circuit here.", 
    "And in this example, let us say\nthat my goal here is to", 
    "find out the current, I1.", 
    "All I care about is to find\nout the current, I1.", 
    "Now of course I can go ahead\nand apply the node", 
    "method and do it.", 
    "But let us say that in this\ncase I want to apply the", 
    "Thevenin method and use this as\nan example, and I&#39;m going", 
    "to show you how simple\nit can get.", 
    "So to apply the Thevenin method,\nremember the first", 
    "part was to identify some\nsub-network and replace that", 
    "by its Thevenin equivalent.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m\ngoing to identify this network", 
    "here as the arbitrary network\nN whose Thevenin equivalent", 
    "I&#39;m going to find.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to view the\nnetwork on the left-hand side,", 
    "the voltage and resistance, as\nthe network E. And the reason", 
    "I&#39;m going to do that is, notice\nthat if I replace", 
    "network N with a Thevenin\nequivalent, which would be", 
    "simply a resistance and a\nvoltage, notice that the", 
    "resulting circuit would be\nvery simple to analyze,", 
    "because it would have pair\nof voltages and a pair of", 
    "resistances in series.", 
    "Let me we go ahead and find the\nThevenin equivalent for", 
    "network one in step one of\nthe Thevenin method.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to replace network\nN by its Thevenin", 
    "equivalent.", 
    "So my network E is going\nto stay the same.", 
    "So E hasn&#39;t changed.", 
    "I&#39;m trying to figure out\nthe value of I1.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to replace the\nnetwork N with this Thevenin", 
    "equivalent.", 
    "So the Thevenin equivalent will\nfit in here into this", 
    "box, and let me draw the\nThevenin pattern, just to be", 
    "clear, where this is R Thevenin", 
    "and this is V Thevenin.", 
    "And we&#39;ll replace network N with\nits Thevenin equivalent,", 
    "and in order to do that, I need\nto find all the values of", 
    "RTH and VTH.", 
    "And let me go ahead\nand do that next.", 
    "Continuing with step one of the\nThevenin method, I have my", 
    "network N. And I need to find\nout VTH and RTH for that", 
    "network N. And again, as a\nreminder, this is what I have", 
    "for VTH and RTH.", 
    "So let me first find\nout the VTH.", 
    "And as I told you earlier, VTH\nis simply the open circuit", 
    "voltage of the network N. So\nhow do I find out what the", 
    "open circuit voltage of\nthat network N is?", 
    "Well, it&#39;s pretty\nstraightforward.", 
    "Let me draw the network here.", 
    "Let&#39;s have an R2 here, and\nI have a current here.", 
    "And the open circuit voltage is\nmy Thevenin voltage, VTH.", 
    "So here&#39;s your simple pattern.", 
    "I have a current I that is\nflowing into a resistance R2.", 
    "And so therefore VTH is\nsimply I times R2.", 
    "So that gives me VTH.", 
    "So the second step, I need\nto find out RTH.", 
    "And the way I&#39;m going to find\nout RTH is I&#39;m going to turn", 
    "off all the independent sources\ninside network N, and", 
    "then measure the resistance\nlooking in.", 
    "So this was my network\nfrom before.", 
    "This corresponds to\nthis network.", 
    "I&#39;ll do the same now.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to put my\nnetwork in there.", 
    "And the difference is that I&#39;m\ngoing to turn off all the", 
    "voltages and currents that are", 
    "independent inside that network.", 
    "So as I draw it out,\nR2 stays the same.", 
    "But here, what I&#39;m going to do\nis I&#39;m going to turn off my", 
    "current source and open-circuit\nthat.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to turn off my\ncurrent source, and so now,", 
    "RTH will simply be the\nresistance looking in.", 
    "That is easy enough to do.", 
    "So RTH is simply R2.", 
    "So there you have it.", 
    "I&#39;ve computed VTH and RTH, and\nthat lets me develop my", 
    "Thevenin network, and I&#39;m\nready for step two.", 
    "So as I said earlier, VTH\nand RTH are given", 
    "by these two values.", 
    "And what I&#39;m going to do is\nI&#39;m going to replace the", 
    "network N with its Thevenin\nequivalent.", 
    "Network E stays the same.", 
    "I show that here.", 
    "That hasn&#39;t changed.", 
    "But now what I&#39;m going to do\nis I&#39;m going to replace the", 
    "network N with its Thevenin\nequivalent like so.", 
    "But I get the RTH in series with\nthe VTH, and the VTH is", 
    "given by IR2 and RTH\nis given by R2.", 
    "So in step two, I now need to\nsolve with the external", 
    "network E applied to the\nThevenin equivalent network", 
    "that as replaced the original\nnetwork N. So this is, again,", 
    "a very simple circuit,\nand recall all that I", 
    "cared about was I1.", 
    "And so, let me let you think for\na couple of seconds about", 
    "what the value of I1 is before\nI go and do it myself.",
