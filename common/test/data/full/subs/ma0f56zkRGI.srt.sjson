    "SPEAKER 1: So let me go on to\na little example showing you", 
    "how a wave sound might look like\nin this scenario with the", 
    "VOH and VOL thresholds.", 
    "So as an example, let&#39;s\nhave a sender.", 
    "And the sender might send values\nover time from one", 
    "sending component to a\nreceiving component.", 
    "And so here I have\nthe time axis.", 
    "And I divide up my 0 to 5 volt\nrange into multiple regions.", 
    "So I have the VOL, and\nI have VOH here.", 
    "So as a sender, recall that my\nvalues for a 0 have to be in", 
    "this range.", 
    "And my values for a 1 should\nbe within that range for", 
    "things to be correct.", 
    "And so therefore, I can\nonly send values in", 
    "this range over time.", 
    "Similarly, for the receiver,\nI can draw the", 
    "same kind of picture.", 
    "But the receiver needs\nto be more relaxed.", 
    "The receiver needs to be able to\ngo all the way up to VIL to", 
    "interpret low values and all\nthe way down to VIH to", 
    "interpret logical high values.", 
    "So therefore, the shaded regions\nhere or the shaded", 
    "regions here indicate the proper\nregions of operation", 
    "for a sender signal.", 
    "And the shaded regions below\nhere are the proper regions of", 
    "operation for a receiver that\nwants to communicate.", 
    "So as an example, I show you\na wave form here which is a", 
    "logically valid wave form.", 
    "To be clearer, this is a\nlogically valid wave form for", 
    "a sender to send.", 
    "So in this case, notice that\nI have a 0 followed by a 1,", 
    "followed by a 0, followed\nby a 1.", 
    "And there you go.", 
    "And since 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s are in the\nvalid regions for a high", 
    "and low, the sender is adhering\nto the standard that", 
    "the sender has promised\nto adhere to.", 
    "Notice that the signals are\ntransitioning through the", 
    "region that the sender\ncan&#39;t be in.", 
    "But the discipline says that\nwhen you switch from one value", 
    "to the other, you very quickly\ngo from a low to a high or a", 
    "high to a low.", 
    "You don&#39;t spend too much time\nin there, so that people can", 
    "have an opportunity to\nmistake some funny", 
    "value in the middle.", 
    "Similarly, as a receiver, the\nreceiver can interpret the", 
    "signals sent in the\nfollowing way.", 
    "So let&#39;s say at the receiver\nthe signal looks like this.", 
    "OK, I get a bunch of noise\nimposed on the signal.", 
    "But notice that even with this\namount of noise imposed on the", 
    "signal, the receiver will\ncorrectly interpret that", 
    "signal as sent by the sender.", 
    "So any value below VIL, it\nis interpreted as a 0.", 
    "Any value above VIH as a 1,\nbelow VIL as a 0, and above", 
    "VIH as a 1.", 
    "And so notice that these values\nare the same values as", 
    "sent by the sender, even though\nI had a bunch of noise", 
    "superimposed by the system.", 
    "So this is really, really\ncool stuff.", 
    "I&#39;ve established a discipline\ninvolving four voltage", 
    "thresholds--", 
    "VOH, VIH, VIL, and VOL.", 
    "And as long as senders adhere to\nthe VOH, VOL constraint and", 
    "receivers to the VIL, VIH\nconstraint, senders and", 
    "receivers can communicate and\nstill have a fair amount of", 
    "noise margin and tolerance\nto noise.", 
    "So to summarize what you have\nlearned so far, digital", 
    "systems are going to follow\na discipline.", 
    "In digital land, we, as\ndesigners, are going to", 
    "promise that within digital land\nwe are going to design", 
    "systems that follow a\ngiven discipline.", 
    "That Discipline is called\nthe static discipline.", 
    "And the static discipline is\ncharacterized by the four", 
    "voltage thresholds--", 
    "VOH, VIH, VIL, and VOL.", 
    "And the static discipline simply\nsays that if the inputs", 
    "to the digital system meet the\nvalid input thresholds, then", 
    "the system will guarantee that\nits output will meet valid", 
    "output thresholds.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So if I have a system, if I am\na system, S, I&#39;m going to", 
    "receive some inputs and I&#39;m\ngoing to produce some outputs.", 
    "The static discipline says that\nif I am a system here,", 
    "then if I see valid inputs--", 
    "OK, what is a valid input?", 
    "A valid input is one that\nadheres to the VIL, VIH", 
    "constraints.", 
    "For a logical 1, the input needs\nto be higher than VIH.", 
    "And for a logical 0, the input\nneeds to be lower than VIL.", 
    "So if as a system, I see valid\ninputs, then I promise that I", 
    "am going to produce\nvalid outputs.", 
    "In other words, my outputs for\na logical 0 are going to be", 
    "better than VOH for a high.", 
    "And they&#39;re going to be lower\nthan a VOL for an output low.", 
    "So this simply says that the\ndigital system, I am going to", 
    "follow the static discipline.", 
    "And if I get valid inputs, then\nI have to guarantee that", 
    "I will meet the valid output\nthresholds at my output.",
