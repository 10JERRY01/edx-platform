    "SPEAKER: We will study energy and power dissipation, and use", 
    "the MOSFET gate as an example.", 
    "So here on the right-hand side, you see a MOSFET gate.", 
    "It's an inverter.", 
    "So we have the pull-up resistor here.", 
    "And we have the MOSFET.", 
    "This is the gate of the MOSFET, the drain, and the", 
    "source of the MOSFET, with an input VI.", 
    "What I've also done here is I'm showing you a capacitor,", 
    "C, that I'm connecting between the output and the ground for", 
    "this inverter.", 
    "This capacitor might combine a set of capacitors connected to", 
    "the output.", 
    "So for example, this capacitor might include the capacitance", 
    "of the gate of a MOSFET that it might be driving.", 
    "This capacitance also includes the capacitance of the wire or", 
    "the wires connected to the output of the inverter.", 
    "So think of this capacitor, C, as the total capacitance", 
    "connected to the drain of the MOSFET or the", 
    "output of the inverter.", 
    "And you'll see why I'm showing you the capacitance there,", 
    "because it will relate to the power consumed by the MOSFET", 
    "and by the entire inverter.", 
    "So what I'm going to focus on here is I'm going to determine", 
    "both the standby power, or static power, and", 
    "the active use power.", 
    "Let me write that down.", 
    "And let me describe what these two mean.", 
    "So standby power relates to the power consumed by the", 
    "inverter when it is not in active use.", 
    "In our context here, it means the following.", 
    "It means that if I keep the input at 0 or 1--", 
    "so I'm going to keep the input at a 0 or a 1.", 
    "I'm not going to change the input.", 
    "Under those conditions, the inverter is going", 
    "to burn some power.", 
    "Clearly, if the input is a 0, then the MOSFET is going to be", 
    "in its off state, and it's not going to burn any power, any", 
    "standby power.", 
    "This is also called static power.", 
    "We'll look at this in more detail.", 
    "On the other hand, supposing--", 
    "so let me just mark this.", 
    "So the standby power, or static power, has to do with", 
    "when I don't change any of the inputs to my devices, and it's", 
    "just sitting there idle.", 
    "And the static, or standby, power relates to the power", 
    "consumed in that state.", 
    "Then there is the active use power.", 
    "For active use power, let us say I supply some", 
    "time varying input.", 
    "Let's say I supply a sequence of 1's and 0's.", 
    "Let's say I apply a square wave, which is a sequence of", 
    "1's and 0's.", 
    "And when that happens, when the MOSFET is switching on and", 
    "off, there is some extra power consumed by the inverter--", 
    "and we'll see why that is the case--", 
    "when it's switching back and forth.", 
    "This is called active use power.", 
    "We will look at both cases.", 
    "In this sequence, I'm going to first develop a set of", 
    "examples that seem unrelated to the inverter first. We will", 
    "use those examples to build our intuition.", 
    "And then I'm going to go and look at the specific example", 
    "of this inverter driving this capacitive load.", 
    "So let me write that down.", 
    "Let's work out a few related examples to build up our", 
    "intuition first. Once we have built our intuition, then", 
    "we're going to try to look at the specific example of our", 
    "inverter with the capacitor.", 
    "So let's get started.", 
    "So the first example that I want to do is a very, very", 
    "simple example that you saw in the very", 
    "beginning of this course.", 
    "But let's start with something extremely simple and then", 
    "build up from there.", 
    "So in this example, I'm going to have a voltage source.", 
    "It's a voltage source.", 
    "Imagine it's a DC source, an even simple example, connected", 
    "to a simple resistor.", 
    "And there is some DC current, I, that's", 
    "flowing through the circuit.", 
    "And this has a resistance R. Now that the voltage source is", 
    "connected across the resistor, the voltage across the", 
    "resistor is also going to be V volts.", 
    "So let's try to figure out two things.", 
    "One, let's figure out, just as a quick review, what is the", 
    "power dissipated in the resistor.", 
    "Second, what I want to do is once we compute the power", 
    "dissipated in the resistor, I want to find out what is the", 
    "energy dissipated in the resistor in some", 
    "given period of time.", 
    "Remember, the power is the rate of consumption of energy.", 
    "So we can also figure out what the energy dissipated is in", 
    "some interval of time T. This is very simple.", 
    "So I'd like you to switch to a little exercise where you can", 
    "try out this conceptual problem yourself and try to", 
    "solve for both the power and the energy dissipated in the", 
    "resistor time T. And once you've had a chance to attack", 
    "it, then I will do the same example myself."
