    "SPEAKER: All right, now that we know the constituent", 
    "relations for a capacitor, let's start by analyzing a", 
    "very simple circuit containing a capacitor.", 
    "How about something as simple as this?", 
    "I have a little current source with a current i of t And I", 
    "connect that to my capacitor with capacitance c.", 
    "And let's say the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor is v of t.", 
    "And let us say that I also give you the initial voltage", 
    "across the capacitor.", 
    "And let me call that initial voltage, let's say for", 
    "example, at some time t0.", 
    "That is the voltage across the capacitor at some time t0.", 
    "So that, let's say, is given.", 
    "So I give you the voltage across the capacitor at t0.", 
    "And my question for you is, find the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor at various points in time.", 
    "So let's go and try this out.", 
    "And we will also try to plot the voltage.", 
    "And as an example, let's do it for the", 
    "following little system.", 
    "So let's say, for example, that this is my time t0 at", 
    "which I'm going to stop the world.", 
    "And I've told you what the initial value is.", 
    "So the initial value at this point in time I have given you", 
    "to be v of t0 for the capacitor.", 
    "And let me pick some current.", 
    "So let me say that the current is 0, and then it is a pulse.", 
    "The height of the pulse is I. So current I for", 
    "some amount of time.", 
    "And that amount of time is capital T. And then the", 
    "current goes back down to 0.", 
    "So I give you the for, of the current value, I ot T. And", 
    "then I'm asking you, find out the value of--", 
    "find out v of t for me for this input current.", 
    "So you should be able to do this by inspection as well.", 
    "But just for fun, let me go ahead and do a little bit of", 
    "it mathematically.", 
    "And then, I'll draw out a graph for you as well.", 
    "So let me just mark these interesting points all", 
    "the way down here.", 
    "OK, so you know that the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]", 
    "of the voltage, v is given by 1 by c minus", 
    "infinity t to t i dt.", 
    "And I also know that the voltage across the capacitor", 
    "at t0 is v of t0.", 
    "So let me go ahead and integrate this.", 
    "So I can make this up as minus infinity to t0 i dt plus 1 by", 
    "c t0 to t i dt.", 
    "So I simply split this up across these two time", 
    "intervals here.", 
    "And then we know that for the first part, this part here, I", 
    "know I've been given that, the voltage at the t0 point.", 
    "I've been given that as v t0.", 
    "That is given.", 
    "Notice right here something very, very interesting.", 
    "Notice how--", 
    "and we look at this in much more", 
    "detail in a later sequence.", 
    "Notice how this v0, this v of t0, which is given, notice how", 
    "it has captured the entire history of the behavior of", 
    "this capacitor from minus infinity all the way to t0.", 
    "So the voltage across the capacitor is able to capture", 
    "the entire history of what has happened before.", 
    "And this really comes from the charge q on the capacitor.", 
    "if it's v of t0, then the charge, q of t0, across the", 
    "capacitor is given by c v of t0.", 
    "We will see this later.", 
    "This q here is called a state variable.", 
    "It's called a state variable for the capacitor because it", 
    "is able to capture in a single scalar value the entire", 
    "history of what has happened to the capacitor from minus", 
    "infinity all the way up to t0.", 
    "That is amazing.", 
    "This is the state of the capacitor.", 
    "So then, let me just continue with the integration here.", 
    "It's pretty simple going forward.", 
    "It is simply t0 to t.", 
    "And I give you i dt.", 
    "So really, all I have to do now is integrate from", 
    "t0 to t for i dt.", 
    "And I won't bore you with the details, but this I can", 
    "further break up into the interval t0 to the point here", 
    "where t starts.", 
    "Let me call that t1.", 
    "t1.", 
    "And this one is t1 plus t, of course.", 
    "And then I can break that up from t0 to t1.", 
    "And I can break that up from t1 to t1 plus t.", 
    "And then, the third interval would be t1 plus", 
    "t all the way out.", 
    "So I won't bore you with the details of the multiple", 
    "segments to consider, but I'll just sketch it out for you.", 
    "So I'm given that it's v of t0 and this was continue.", 
    "Since I is 0, until t1, I get v of t0 as the voltage across", 
    "the capacitor for a while.", 
    "Then, at that point, notice that when I get a voltage I", 
    "across the capacitor.", 
    "I'm sorry, when I get a current I that is now being", 
    "pumped through the capacitor.", 
    "The capacitor voltage--", 
    "so here I, this will be a constant I. And integrated", 
    "with respect to t, I get a time parameter there.", 
    "And so therefore, the current through my capacitor will", 
    "increase linearly over time until that fixed value of I is", 
    "pumped through the capacitor.", 
    "So that keeps going on.", 
    "And then, when the current goes back down to 0, then the", 
    "capacitor stops charging up further, and then holds on to", 
    "its value from there.", 
    "This height here, what is this height here?", 
    "So during that time, during the time T, I've got some", 
    "charge in the capacitor.", 
    "That charge increase is delta q.", 
    "That charge increase is delta q, and that is given by I", 
    "times T. So if I have a current I flowing for time T,", 
    "then the charge that I have deposited on the capacitor is", 
    "I times T. The voltage increase across the capacitor", 
    "will be simply that divided by the capacitance.", 
    "So it will be I T divided by the capacitance c, that's", 
    "increase in voltage across the capacitor.", 
    "So this will be the plot for the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor as a function of time.", 
    "And if like, you can of course, go and do this", 
    "mathematically for each of these intervals.", 
    "The first interval is until t1, and that's given by this", 
    "flat value here.", 
    "And then you go from t1 to t1 plus t.", 
    "That's this value here.", 
    "And then you go from t1 plus t onwards, which", 
    "is this flat value.", 
    "Again, pretty straightforward.", 
    "And if you want to look at more relatively simple", 
    "examples like this, I encourage you to go and look", 
    "at Section 9.4 in the textbook.", 
    "OK, you can see a bunch of other examples, and I", 
    "encourage you to go look them up and study them for", 
    "yourselves."
