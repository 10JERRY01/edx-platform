    "In this sequence, we will look at two topics.", 
    "First, we will look at the MOSFET in its full glory.", 
    "So far we looked at the MOSFET as a switch.", 
    "And we also looked at its behavior, both as a short", 
    "circuit and in a slightly more detailed model we looked at", 
    "its behavior when the MOSFET is in its on stage as a", 
    "resistor using the sr model.", 
    "We will look at the MOSFET in its more fuller form.", 
    "And look at more of an expanded", 
    "behavior for the MOSFET.", 
    "And then we will look at building some circuits, such", 
    "as the amplifier using the MOSFET.", 
    "So continuing with our review, in the last sequence we looked", 
    "at dependent sources.", 
    "And the way dependent sources work is that, as shown in this", 
    "example, which has a dependent current source, this is a", 
    "voltage-controlled current source, VCCS.", 
    "And in this, the current of the dependent current source", 
    "is dependent on some voltage v that is captured as part of", 
    "some other portion of the circuit.", 
    "And the v here could be some other voltage in the circuit.", 
    "So v here is the difference between the potential", 
    "difference between the a, a prime terminals.", 
    "And so I can build a circuit containing dependent sources", 
    "where variables such as currents or voltages and so on", 
    "depend on other parameters in the circuit.", 
    "We looked at a bunch of other dependent sources, such as a", 
    "current-controlled voltage source and so on.", 
    "We also looked at superpositioned rules with", 
    "dependent sources.", 
    "While there are many ways of doing this, and you can look", 
    "at more details in section 3.5.1 of the textbook, a", 
    "method that we will commonly use is to analyze circuits", 
    "with dependent sources using superposition by simply", 
    "leaving all the dependent sources in.", 
    "So you just leave the dependent sources in the", 
    "circuit, don't touch them.", 
    "And according to the superposition method, solve", 
    "for one independent source at a time.", 
    "Recall with the superposition method, I shut off all the", 
    "sources except for one source.", 
    "Compute the partial result.", 
    "And do this for every independent source.", 
    "I just leave my dependent sources in and I just do this", 
    "one at a time with independent sources.", 
    "And this will take care of our dependent sources in circuits", 
    "where we apply the superposition method.", 
    "Then, let me do a quick review of the amplifier and the", 
    "reading for this to get some more detail is", 
    "Chapter 7.3 to 7.7.", 
    "So we looked at the amplifier in our previous sequence.", 
    "And we constructed the amplifier using a", 
    "voltage-controlled current source.", 
    "In this case, my current iD through the dependent source", 
    "was related to some voltage applied at its control port.", 
    "So this was my control port.", 
    "And in this case, I applied a voltage VI across the control", 
    "port, and that caused a current iD to flow through the", 
    "dependent source.", 
    "And in the example that we covered the last time, the", 
    "current iD was related to the input voltage, according to iD", 
    "was equal to K divided by 2 where K is some constant,", 
    "times VI minus 1 all squared.", 
    "And we said, for the example dependent source that we", 
    "talked about, we said VI needed to be greater than 1", 
    "volt for this current source relationship to apply.", 
    "So we said when VI was more than 1 volt, then the", 
    "dependent source had a current given by K divided by 2 VI", 
    "minus 1 all squared.", 
    "And when VI was less than 1, then the", 
    "dependent source shut off.", 
    "So we said that for this little circuit pattern, the", 
    "output voltage V0 was given by VS minus iD RL.", 
    "VS was a supply voltage.", 
    "And the way I got that was we're writing the node", 
    "equations at this node with the unknown voltage V0.", 
    "OK, so you can write the node equation pretty", 
    "straightforwardly as V0 minus VS divide by RL is the", 
    "current going up.", 
    "And if I sum the currents leaving the node, then I would", 
    "add iD to that and that would be 0.", 
    "And then if I went ahead and simplified this, I would get", 
    "V0 equals VS minus iD RL.", 
    "And then where iD here was given by the expression for", 
    "the current, K divide by 2 VI minus 1 all squared.", 
    "Now one important point here is you recall I talked about", 
    "patterns in circuits and electronics.", 
    "And we said that although we could build circuits many,", 
    "many which ways, we tend to focus on a few patterns.", 
    "So this pattern is a common pattern where I have a", 
    "resistor connected to a supply.", 
    "And then connected to a dependent source to ground.", 
    "And then I have some input providing a voltage.", 
    "This is again, a very, very common pattern that you will", 
    "see a lot in this course.", 
    "So before we go on to new material in this sequence, I", 
    "wanted to refresh your memory on the i-v relationship for a", 
    "current source.", 
    "So recall what the i-v relationship for a current", 
    "source was.", 
    "For an independent current source, no matter what the", 
    "voltage was, my current was a constant.", 
    "So this is the i-v relation for a current source.", 
    "Now, we'll use this fact and observe", 
    "behavior of certain devices.", 
    "And when you see the current versus voltage relationship", 
    "looking like this, where the current looks like a flat", 
    "line, then that is indicative of a current source.", 
    "So I want you to hold that thought.", 
    "Hold that thought and when I show you some flat lines, I", 
    "want you to say, a-ha, current source.", 
    "So just keep that thought and we'll get to", 
    "that in a few minutes."
