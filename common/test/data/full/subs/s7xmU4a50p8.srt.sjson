    "SPEAKER 1: So I'm going to show you where this class is", 
    "going next.", 
    "And that's something called small signal analysis.", 
    "So if I have a device and it has a characteristic that", 
    "looks, for example, like this, what I can do is I can pick", 
    "off a little piece of this, and if I look closely enough,", 
    "it looks like a straight line.", 
    "That's called a derivative.", 
    "And doing this is called a small signal analysis.", 
    "I take this piece, I blow it up, I shift it onto the axes", 
    "so that 0 sits in the middle of it, and at that point,", 
    "small signal or incremental, this is what it looks like.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: In fact, this place is called the operating point.", 
    "And these are representing small deviations from the", 
    "operating point.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So you end up phrasing this as a voltage", 
    "plus its operating point plus some derivative off of that.", 
    "And why is this useful and where will you see that?", 
    "Well you've seen one device with an S-curve and use it as", 
    "a digital gate where you operate it as either over here", 
    "or over here.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: If we want an amplifier, for example, we", 
    "really want something with small changes in the input but", 
    "big changes in the output.", 
    "So we could have a little change like this on the input", 
    "and if we raise it up to here that produces a much bigger", 
    "change on the output coming out like that.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So this is an example of where we want to", 
    "operate a device if we [UNINTELLIGIBLE]", 
    "gain.", 
    "And this is where the course is going with", 
    "this incremental analysis.", 
    "First of all, Anant is going to show", 
    "you incremental analysis.", 
    "Second, he's going to show you how a MOSFET behaves when it's", 
    "not just a switch, when it's operating in this region, we", 
    "have this very steep slope.", 
    "And after that, this is a very complex equation to deal with,", 
    "this whole curve.", 
    "And so what we're going to do is we're going to pretend that", 
    "this is a straight line and it won't be a", 
    "perfectly straight line.", 
    "It'll sit somewhere between, let's say, over here and over", 
    "here depending on where in this region you are.", 
    "But you sort of pretend that it's a straight", 
    "line with an error.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And then indeed you make a model it's called where", 
    "the model is a particular description of the way this", 
    "MOSFET behaves in the region that you specify.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So that's where the courses is going over the next", 
    "two lectures."
