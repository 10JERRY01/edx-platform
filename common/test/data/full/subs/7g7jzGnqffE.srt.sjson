    "SPEAKER 1: Now let&#39;s take a look\nat the transfer functions", 
    "using the SR model for the\nMOSFET and see how that", 
    "changes our analysis.", 
    "Let&#39;s see if that changes\nwhether inverters that are", 
    "built out of these MOSFETs--\nwhen we use a more accurate", 
    "model for the MOSFET--", 
    "let&#39;s see whether they still\nsatisfy the static discipline", 
    "under the more accurate\nMOSFET models.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with the model\nfor a MOSFET inverter.", 
    "And notice here that I&#39;ve showed\nyou the basic schematic", 
    "of our MOSFET inverter\nwith a switch.", 
    "And when I replace that with a\nMOSFET, I&#39;m going to get a", 
    "MOSFET in place of\nthe switch here.", 
    "Now under the conditions that\nI use to get different", 
    "inputs-- so for c equals\n0 and for c equals 1--", 
    "I get different subcircuits.", 
    "So for the MOSFET in the off\nstate, here is the circuit", 
    "that I get.", 
    "So this is RL, this is VS,\nthis is my output, Vout.", 
    "I get c equals 0 applied to the\ngate of the MOSFET, and", 
    "this is for the condition that\nVGS is less than VT.", 
    "And the MOSFET is in its off\nstate, and the MOSFET switch", 
    "is turned off.", 
    "Then for c is equal\nto 1, I get a", 
    "slightly different situation.", 
    "I get something that\nlooks like this.", 
    "So this was Ron.", 
    "In this situation, I get\nRL and VS as before.", 
    "Here&#39;s my Vout.", 
    "But here, c is equal to\n1, and VGS is greater", 
    "than or equal to VT.", 
    "And in this case, this is Ron.", 
    "And notice that the MOSFET\nswitch in this case is going", 
    "to be it its on state.", 
    "That&#39;s the basic circuit\nthat I&#39;m going to get.", 
    "Let me just make\nit very clear.", 
    "Let me just draw a line here,\nso you can see the two", 
    "circuits clearly for the on\nstate and for the off state.", 
    "And as before, I can write the\ntruth table for the MOSFET.", 
    "None of that changes.", 
    "So this is the output\nof the device.", 
    "Let me call that the logical\noutput, OUT, and Vout", 
    "corresponds to the voltage.", 
    "So OUT corresponds to the\nlogical output, and the", 
    "voltage is Vout.", 
    "So as before, nothing\nreally changes.", 
    "When c is a 0, in this case on\nthe top diagram, you get Vout", 
    "equals 5 volts, so the\noutput is a 1.", 
    "And when c is equal to 1, then\nsomething interesting happens.", 
    "So when c is equal to\n1, what is Vout?", 
    "So when c is 1, the Vout can\nbe written as follows.", 
    "Vout is a voltage divider action\nbetween RL and Ron, so", 
    "I get VS is Ron divided\nby RL plus Ron.", 
    "OK, so that is my Vout.", 
    "So really, just by looking at\nit, I actually cannot say", 
    "whether the output is going\nto be a 1 or 0.", 
    "But let&#39;s make the assumption\nthat Ron is much", 
    "smaller than RL.", 
    "And if Ron is much smaller than\nRL, then I can make this", 
    "expression here much\nless than V OL.", 
    "I can make it less than V OL.", 
    "So if Ron is much less than\nRL, then I can ignore Ron", 
    "compared to RL, and so Ron\ndivided by RL is going to be", 
    "significantly lower than 1, and\nmultiply by VS, I can make", 
    "that less than V OL.", 
    "So if I end up choosing\nmy parameters--", 
    "in this case, my parameters\nRL and Ron and VS--", 
    "if I choose these parameters,\nRL, Ron, and VS, wisely, then", 
    "I can make this condition\nto be true.", 
    "I can make sure that Vout is\nless than or equal to V OL for", 
    "the case where c\nis equal to 1.", 
    "So in that case, when c is a 1,\nI can get a correct logical", 
    "0 at the output.", 
    "And so this is a key expression,\nwhich is VS Ron", 
    "divided by RL plus Ron must be\nless than or equal to V OL,", 
    "and that will end up giving me\na valid output when the input", 
    "is in a high state.", 
    "I can now plot the transfer\nfunction for the inverter", 
    "using the more accurate model,\nthe SR model, for the MOSFET.", 
    "I&#39;ve shown you a lot of these\nthings before, so I won&#39;t", 
    "redraw them for you.", 
    "I&#39;ll show you the inverter up\nhere, and then I&#39;ll show you", 
    "the subcircuit for the inverter\nwhen c is 0, and the", 
    "subcircuit when c is a 1.", 
    "When c is a 0, notice that the\nswitch is in its off state,", 
    "and when the input is a 1, the\nMOSFET is in its on state, and", 
    "the second circuit applies.", 
    "So I can now look at the various\nvalues and see what", 
    "the voltage transfer function\nreally looks like.", 
    "And to do the plot, let me make\nthe assumption that RL", 
    "divided by Ron is 10.", 
    "I&#39;m going to pick my MOSFET\nsuch that RL divided", 
    "by Ron equals 10.", 
    "Now in general, you can go look\nat your textbook, and the", 
    "textbook will talk about how you\ncan design MOSFETs to have", 
    "various values of Ron.", 
    "The basic way is just as you\nincrease the width of an", 
    "element, its resistance\ndecreases, so you can make the", 
    "MOSFET wider, and that reduces\nits resistance.", 
    "So the book will show\nyou how to do this.", 
    "It&#39;s not that important\nfor [UNINTELLIGIBLE]", 
    "So RL divided by Ron equals\n10 in my little example.", 
    "I&#39;m going to pick\nVS equals 10.", 
    "And so therefore, my expression\nfor VS Ron divided", 
    "by RL plus Ron, which was the\nlow output voltage, is going", 
    "to be 0.45 volts.", 
    "So if RL divided by Ron is 10,\nthen this expression becomes", 
    "VS times 1 divided by RL\ndivided by Ron plus 1.", 
    "So if RL divided by Ron is 10,\nthen it&#39;s VS divided by 11,", 
    "and if VS is 10 volts, then\nVS divided by 11 is 0.45.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at what the\nvoltage transfer curve for", 
    "this inverter looks like under\nthe more accurate model for", 
    "the MOSFET.", 
    "So when Vin is less than VT, the\nswitch is turned off, and", 
    "so the output is straight VS. So\nthe out put is straight VS", 
    "when Vin is less than VT.", 
    "No surprises there.", 
    "However, when the input\nc equals 1--", 
    "in other words, when Vin\nis a high value--", 
    "then the MOSFET turns on, and\nVout is given by the voltage", 
    "divider action between Ron and\nRL, and specifically the", 
    "output is going to look like\nthis expression here, which I", 
    "found to be 0.45.", 
    "Because this is my function\nhere, so this is 0.45 volts.", 
    "So this is a transfer\nfunction.", 
    "Recall, in the past, when I had\nan ideal switch, my output", 
    "was along the x-axis.", 
    "But in this case, it&#39;s\ntranslated up to 0.45 volts.", 
    "So this is the transfer function\nof a MOSFET under the", 
    "SR model, for the given choices\nof VS, Ron, and RL.", 
    "The next question to ask\nourselves is does this", 
    "inverter still satisfy some of\nthe voltage thresholds we", 
    "looked at previously for the\nsame voltage thresholds of", 
    "various static disciplines?", 
    "We&#39;ll just do one\nexample here.", 
    "You can try out the other\nexamples yourself, but let&#39;s", 
    "do this example here.", 
    "And I&#39;ll show you the voltage\ntransfer function on the left", 
    "hand side for the inverter,\nwith the SR", 
    "model for the MOSFET.", 
    "So just to be clear,\n[INAUDIBLE]", 
    "just write that down.", 
    "So this is using the SR\nmodel for MOSFET.", 
    "Basically I get the low output\nvoltage at 0.5 volts.", 
    "And so the question then to ask\nourselves is, does this", 
    "satisfy the static discipline?", 
    "So notice, as before, most of\nthe things stay the same.", 
    "The transition point is\nat VT equals 1 volt.", 
    "So as was our usual trick, let\nme draw the horizontal and", 
    "vertical lines.", 
    "So let me start with the\nV OH and V OL lines.", 
    "So V OL is at 0.5 volts.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to draw V OH\nat 4.5 volts, and then I&#39;m", 
    "going to draw V IH at\n4.1, and then I can", 
    "draw V IL at 0.9 volts.", 
    "So notice that according to\nwhat I described to you", 
    "earlier, the valid\nregions are here.", 
    "And notice that when the input\nis less than 0.9 volts, the", 
    "output is in the valid region,\nand when the input is above", 
    "4.1 volts, the output is again\nin the valid region.",
