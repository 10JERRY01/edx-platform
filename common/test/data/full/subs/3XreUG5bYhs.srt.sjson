    "SPEAKER 1: I hope you had a chance to try out the node", 
    "method yourself, and obtain v0 as a function of vi and take a", 
    "look at it.", 
    "But let me go ahead and solve that for you.", 
    "So note here, this is my ids equation for the voltage", 
    "controlled current source.", 
    "It's linear in this case.", 
    "And recall that this vi is Vgs for the MOSFET.", 
    "So this is the drain, this is the gate,", 
    "and this is the source.", 
    "So that vi is simply the small signal gate to source voltage.", 
    "So let's apply the node method and solve this circuit.", 
    "Before we begin, I just want to give you a small, little", 
    "note of caution.", 
    "So in this case, you see two sources.", 
    "You see an input source, vi, and then you see this", 
    "dependent current source here.", 
    "And so you might say, aha, two sources, superposition.", 
    "But be very careful here.", 
    "Remember, with the superposition method, you have", 
    "to leave all the dependent sources in the circuit.", 
    "Your dependent sources will need to stay in the circuit,", 
    "and you shut off each of the independent input", 
    "sources one at a time.", 
    "So in this case, superposition doesn't quite apply because", 
    "when you leave the dependent source in the circuit, you're", 
    "left with only one source.", 
    "So it's a degenerate case.", 
    "And you may as well just go ahead and solve it.", 
    "So just be very, very cautious.", 
    "So let's dive into the node method.", 
    "And so I know the node voltage here.", 
    "This is vi.", 
    "And the only node with an unknown voltage is up here,", 
    "and its unknown node voltage is v0.", 
    "So let's go ahead and write the node method.", 
    "So let me sum the currents going out of the node.", 
    "So the current leaving this node is simply going to be v0", 
    "divided by RL.", 
    "We're gonna add to that the current leaving this node in", 
    "the downward direction, and that is simply ids.", 
    "And that should sum to 0 according to KCL.", 
    "So simplifying a little bit, I get v0 equal to minus idsRL.", 
    "And then what I can do is I can", 
    "substitute for ids in here.", 
    "And what I'm left with is v0 equals minus K, VI minus VT", 
    "times small vi times RL.", 
    "So I just get RL times small vi.", 
    "So all I've done is simply substituted for ids from the", 
    "voltage controlled current source equation off the", 
    "linearized MOSFET.", 
    "And if you recall, KVI minus VT was simply gm.", 
    "And so this is gm, the transconductance,", 
    "times RL times vi.", 
    "So not surprisingly, this is v0, this is vi.", 
    "And that this is a constant, a constant with respect to the", 
    "input voltage.", 
    "And so therefore, notice that I have a linear amplifier.", 
    "And that was really, really easy to do.", 
    "And I was able to very quickly use the node method and derive", 
    "the v0 versus vi characteristic for my little", 
    "linearized amplifier.", 
    "So that was really easy.", 
    "Now one thing to remember is that in general small signal", 
    "circuit models like this are extremely useful because", 
    "you're gonna have multiple sources in there.", 
    "I can use the superposition method.", 
    "So all my linear tools will apply.", 
    "I can use [UNINTELLIGIBLE] and all of that stuff.", 
    "So building a small signal linearized circuit can be very", 
    "useful because I can use very powerful techniques to go and", 
    "solve circuits like that.", 
    "So as a next step, let me go ahead and look at this in a", 
    "little bit more detail and provide some perspective here.", 
    "So I have showed so far that by analyzing this small signal", 
    "circuit, I was able to obtain a relationship", 
    "between v0 and vi.", 
    "Now however, you also have to know a couple of things.", 
    "First of all, notice that the small signal circuit, by", 
    "construction, is identical to the large signal circuit.", 
    "The topology is identical.", 
    "The only thing that is different are I've replaced", 
    "the large signal models with small signal models.", 
    "So for example, I replaced this voltage source with its", 
    "small signal model, which was a short circuit.", 
    "I did that by construction.", 
    "We could look at a proof for why I was able to do that.", 
    "The second thing you need to know is that you do need all", 
    "the operating point voltage and currents.", 
    "So for instance, the behavior of the small signal circuit", 
    "depends on the bias point values from the", 
    "large signal circuit.", 
    "So therefore, you need to do a large signal analysis in order", 
    "to get those bias point voltages.", 
    "A second little piece of insight that you can note is", 
    "oftentimes when you're just trying to find some insight", 
    "into the behavior of circuits, again, if you just want to", 
    "find some insight into how does this circuit behave for", 
    "small signals, if you don't want to get exact numbers,", 
    "then oftentimes you can just go ahead and build the small", 
    "signal circuit and analyze it.", 
    "And you don't have to do a large signal", 
    "analysis in that case.", 
    "But you can get inside just by looking at the small signal", 
    "circuit directly without having to go through what is", 
    "necessarily a non-linear analysis if your large signal", 
    "circuit was a non-linear circuit.", 
    "Also, remember that you can build a small signal model for", 
    "a linear circuit as well.", 
    "Just that the small signal model is going to be very", 
    "similar to the large signal model, just that your sources", 
    "will be shut off.", 
    "So if all the elements are linear plus a voltage sources,", 
    "then in your small signal model, you leave all the", 
    "linear elements as is.", 
    "Just that you will shut off your sources.", 
    "So your voltage sources will be short-circuited, and your", 
    "current sources will be open-circuited."
