    "SPEAKER 1: Well, it turns out\nthat I don&#39;t need a variable", 
    "there because of the trick\nthat I used in picking my", 
    "ground node.", 
    "By picking my ground node where\nit was, notice that the", 
    "voltage at this node is simply\nv0, because this node is", 
    "connected to ground by\na voltage source.", 
    "And so the voltage source would\nhold the voltage of that", 
    "node at v0.", 
    "So I directly have the\nvoltage of that node.", 
    "So right there I&#39;ve done\nmy second step.", 
    "So that&#39;s my step two\nof node analysis.", 
    "So let&#39;s move on and\nstart off with step", 
    "three of node analysis.", 
    "All right?", 
    "Step three would be to write KCL\nfor the nodes-- on each of", 
    "the nodes-- e1 and e2 here,\nwhich are my unknowns.", 
    "I&#39;m going to write KCL for these\nnodes, and I am going to", 
    "substitute device laws and KVL\nin dividing the current that", 
    "leaves those nodes.", 
    "But also remember that as I work\nwith currents, and sum", 
    "the currents for KCL, I&#39;ll\nsimply use my usual", 
    "convention, which is sum the\ncurrents leaving a node always", 
    "so I don&#39;t make mistakes.", 
    "Now again, for another piece of\nconvenience, I&#39;m going to", 
    "use conductances.", 
    "So the variable I have\nis resistance.", 
    "1 by that resistance is the\nconductance, since I would", 
    "just use that to make my algebra\na little simpler.", 
    "So let&#39;s get started.", 
    "Let&#39;s start with node e1.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to write\nKCL at node e1.", 
    "Now, with KCL, notice that I&#39;m\ngoing to follow my usual", 
    "convention to avoid mistakes.", 
    "I&#39;m going to add up the currents\nthat leave a node so", 
    "that I don&#39;t make mistakes.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and start.", 
    "Let me start with KCL at e1.", 
    "So if you look at e1, what is\nthe current that is going up", 
    "in that direction?", 
    "I know the node voltage\nhere is e1.", 
    "I know the voltage of\nthis node is v0.", 
    "So can you tell me what the\ncurrent is going up?", 
    "Let me pause for a second so\nthat you can think about it.", 
    "And then I&#39;ll go back\nand do it for you."
