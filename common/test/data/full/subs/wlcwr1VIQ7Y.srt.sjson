    "SPEAKER 1: So the fourth loop\nreally is this outer loop here", 
    "that goes like so.", 
    "That is four.", 
    "So notice that I have four\nnodes, and I have four loops,", 
    "and I have 12 unknowns.", 
    "And the goal of the method will\nbe to find out the values", 
    "of each of these 12 unknowns.", 
    "If you&#39;re ready, now that you&#39;ve\nlabeled the circuit,", 
    "let&#39;s go to step one of\nthe KVL, KCL method.", 
    "And our overall goal will be\nto find out the values of", 
    "these 12 unknowns.", 
    "You see the circuit on the\nright-hand side, and then", 
    "notice that all the branch\nvariables have been assigned", 
    "as we did in the\nprevious step.", 
    "So the first step of the KVL,\nKCL method is to write down", 
    "all the element v, i\nrelationships so", 
    "there are six elements--", 
    "one, two, the R2, R3, R4,\nR5, so six elements.", 
    "So let&#39;s write down six\nv, i relationships.", 
    "So for the volted source,\nI get V0 is capital V0.", 
    "And this is given because\nI know the value", 
    "of the voltage here.", 
    "I can do V1 is i1R1.", 
    "V2 is i2R2.", 
    "And then for resistor three,\nI can write V3 is i3R3.", 
    "V4 is i4R4.", 
    "And V5 is i5R5.", 
    "So notice that there are\nsix equations here.", 
    "So we&#39;re done with the element\nrelationships.", 
    "And let me now go on to the\nnext step of the KVL, KCL", 
    "method, which is to write KCL\nat each of the nodes.", 
    "So I have four nodes, A, B, C,\nand D. So let&#39;s start by", 
    "writing KCL for node A.", 
    "So let&#39;s write KCL\nfor node A.", 
    "So at node eight, notice that\nI have three currents deal", 
    "with, i0, i1, and i4.", 
    "So here, again, I&#39;m going\nto use a little bit of a", 
    "convention in how I\nsum up currents.", 
    "And as a rule, I can sum\ncurrents going in or", 
    "currents going out.", 
    "But again, I&#39;m just going\nto use a convention.", 
    "I am going to sum currents\nleaving the node.", 
    "So for every node, I&#39;m just\ngoing to sum currents leaving", 
    "the node if they should\nadd up to 0.", 
    "So for node eight, notice that\ncurrent i0 is leaving the", 
    "node, i1 is leaving the node,\nand i4 is leaving the node.", 
    "So I can sum them all up to be\ni0 plus i4 plus i1 equals 0.", 
    "Similarly, for node b,\nI have currents--", 
    "let&#39;s see, we have i2 leaving\nthe node, so i2.", 
    "Then we have i3 leaving\nthe node.", 
    "So I write i3.", 
    "And then, notice that i1 is\ncoming into the node.", 
    "So there, it&#39;s not a plus,\nbut it&#39;s a minus i1", 
    "coming into the node.", 
    "And that equals 0.", 
    "Then, similarly, at the next\nnode, b, I can write down i5", 
    "leaving the node minus\ni4 leaving the node.", 
    "And then I have i3 coming\ninto the node.", 
    "So it is minus i3 leaving\nthe node.", 
    "Finally, for c, I have minus i0\nminus i2 minus i5 equals 0.", 
    "So in this case, I have\nfour equations.", 
    "But notice that even though\nthere&#39;s four equations,", 
    "because of the circuit topology,\nthere is one", 
    "dependent equation.", 
    "So I really end up getting three\nindependent equations.", 
    "So as you&#39;re doing the analysis,\nyou will find that", 
    "there&#39;s only three independent\nequations, given these four", 
    "nodes in a circuit.", 
    "OK, let&#39;s go to step three\nof the KVL, KCL method.", 
    "And the step three says write\ndown the Kirchhoff&#39;s Voltage", 
    "Law, KVL, for each\nof the nodes.", 
    "So here, again, let me start by\nwriting KVL for loop one.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m\ngoing to follow loop one in", 
    "this direction.", 
    "I&#39;m going to go around clockwise\nfor loop one.", 
    "So here, again, I have a\nconvention to follow.", 
    "As I go down the loop, how do\nI write down the voltages?", 
    "There&#39;s many conventions\npeople follow.", 
    "But the convention that I follow\nand I recommend, which", 
    "is very simple, is as you go\naround the loop, you simply", 
    "assign to each voltage the\nfirst encountered sign.", 
    "So as you go around this loop\nhere, I get the v0 voltage.", 
    "And the sign encountered\nis minus.", 
    "So I&#39;m going to assign\nthat a minus sign.", 
    "So let&#39;s do that.", 
    "So for the loop one, I&#39;m\ngoing to go around the", 
    "loop in this direction.", 
    "And the first encountered\nvoltage is v0.", 
    "And the first encountered\nsign is a minus.", 
    "So I write minus v0.", 
    "And I continue down this way.", 
    "And I hit v1.", 
    "In this case, I hit\nthe plus sign.", 
    "So it is plus v1.", 
    "And I go down.", 
    "And then I hit plus v2.", 
    "And that sums to 0.", 
    "Similarly, for loop two, I&#39;m\ngoing to go around the loop.", 
    "Why don&#39;t I say just for fun,\nfor this loop, why don&#39;t I go", 
    "around in a counterclockwise\nmanner.", 
    "So in this case, I&#39;m going to\nhit the positive terminal of", 
    "v1 first. So I write plus v1.", 
    "Then I&#39;m going to hit the\npositive terminal of v3.", 
    "So I write plus v3.", 
    "Then the minus terminal\nof v4, so minus v4.", 
    "So similarly, for loop three,\nI get v3 plus v5", 
    "minus v2 equals 0.", 
    "And for loop four, I get minus\nv0 plus v4 plus v5 equals 0.", 
    "And again, because of the\ncircuit topologies, there&#39;s", 
    "three independent loops.", 
    "And so I get three independent\nequations.", 
    "And so this last equation\nis redundant.", 
    "OK, so putting it all\ntogether, I&#39;m in", 
    "the KVL, KCL method.", 
    "You saw that we developed six\nequations for the element", 
    "relationships.", 
    "And then we had three\nindependent equations from the", 
    "KCL at the nodes and three\nmore KVL at the nodes.", 
    "So in all, notice that we ended\nup with 12 equations.", 
    "And recall we had 12 unknowns,\nv0 through v5", 
    "and i0 through i5.", 
    "So now you can take these 12\nequations and put them into a", 
    "hopper and turn the crank.", 
    "And you can go and\nget the answer.", 
    "However, this is very grubby.", 
    "But even a simple circuit like\nthis, now, with just a small", 
    "number of elements, three inner\nloops and one outer", 
    "loop, I had a horrible mess,\n12 equations, 12 unknown.", 
    "And so this works, but\nthis is a real pain.", 
    "We will see that the node\nmethod, which builds on the", 
    "KVL, KCL method, will\nbe much, much better", 
    "and will be way simpler.", 
    "And we&#39;ll have far fewer\nequations than", 
    "the KVL, KCL method.", 
    "But it&#39;s good to know about the\nKVL, KCL method, because", 
    "it&#39;s the simplest method\nthat there is.", 
    "Just that it ends up with a\nwhole boatload of equations", 
    "that you have to solve.",
