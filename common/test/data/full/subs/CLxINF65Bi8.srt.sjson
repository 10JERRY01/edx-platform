    "SPEAKER 1: So in the previous\ndemo, you saw me trying to", 
    "pump some music through an\nLED, and a music signal", 
    "through an LED, convert that\nto light, and then receive", 
    "that in a photo receiver\nand play some music.", 
    "But because the LED was so\nhighly nonlinear, I was", 
    "getting horribly distorted\noutput at", 
    "the end of my receiver.", 
    "So what did I do?", 
    "How do I go about making\nthis work?", 
    "Well, I could try and imagine\na perfect linear device.", 
    "And so supposing I had a\nperfect LED that had a", 
    "perfectly linear response, then\nlife would&#39;ve been great.", 
    "So if I had a linear response\nlike this--", 
    "here&#39;s my voltage VD.", 
    "And here is the output I\nwould have produced.", 
    "OK, so just to confirm that this\nis true, let&#39;s take some", 
    "voltage here.", 
    "So that is some voltage here.", 
    "Let&#39;s call that point a.", 
    "This is my time point a.", 
    "This voltage is here.", 
    "And so, I&#39;m going to get\nsome current here.", 
    "Let&#39;s call that a.", 
    "And that current is going to\nrelate to a current at the", 
    "output at some time point\nout here, which is", 
    "going to be this, a.", 
    "Similarly out here, I\nget a point here.", 
    "And that leads to\na current here.", 
    "And that is b.", 
    "So, a, and b, and so on.", 
    "Let me just call that a time, a\ntime and b time, and b time,", 
    "just to make clear that those\nare time points and not", 
    "voltage or current points.", 
    "So notice that if I have a nice\nand linear LED, then life", 
    "would&#39;ve been perfect.", 
    "Because as my voltage makes its\nsinusoidal transitions, it", 
    "will be transformed by the\nlinear relationship between VD", 
    "and iD into a sinusoidal\ncurrent.", 
    "OK, with nice, easygoing,\nnegative transitions.", 
    "OK, this is zero.", 
    "This is zero.", 
    "Lots of nice negative\ntransitions.", 
    "And a nice sinusoid here that\nwas linearly related to the", 
    "sinusoid at the input.", 
    "Again if, if, if, I had this\nlinear transfer function, life", 
    "would have been just\nabsolutely great.", 
    "That&#39;s been my problem.", 
    "What do I do now?", 
    "What do we do?", 
    "So I&#39;m not going to show\nyou the trick today.", 
    "I will leave you in\nbit of suspense.", 
    "And I will cover that in\nthe next sequence.", 
    "And just as a precursor to\nupcoming attractions, the", 
    "trick is, believe it or not,\nit&#39;s going to be zen.", 
    "Zen is the answer.", 
    "I&#39;m going to make you\ndo the zen trick.", 
    "And then suddenly, you&#39;re\ngoing to get music--", 
    "clear, undistorted music--", 
    "even though you have a highly\nnonlinear device, and it will", 
    "be the next sequence.", 
    "Meanwhile, I&#39;d love for you to\ngo and think about how that", 
    "would work.", 
    "How might you go about getting\na linear response from this", 
    "nonlinear device and transmit\nmusic to this garage door", 
    "opener which is nonlinear\nin a manner that", 
    "is distortion free?", 
    "Think about it.", 
    "Sleep on it.", 
    "And see if we can come up with\nthe brilliant idea that it&#39;s a", 
    "small signal trick, and\nmake it all work.",
