    "SPEAKER 1: In this last video of this sequence here, let me", 
    "very quickly summarize what we've seen so far, and then", 
    "give you a preview of upcoming attractions.", 
    "And it's exciting to note that we will have a huge aha moment", 
    "in our next sequence.", 
    "So, as a quick summary my input VI was a sine--", 
    "you saw it--", 
    "VI cosine of omega t, and we wanted to find the", 
    "response for it.", 
    "So I said what you were going to do was, as a step 1, set up", 
    "a differential equation.", 
    "Trig and all that stuff was really hard, so I said let's", 
    "try the sneaky input, VI e raised to st,", 
    "where s was j omega.", 
    "And then I went ahead and found out the particular", 
    "solution to the sneaky input VP e raised to st. And I", 
    "substituted VP e raised to st as the particular solution,", 
    "and I very quickly obtained the complex amplitude.", 
    "So VP is the complex amplitude of the particular solution to", 
    "the sneaky input.", 
    "And so this was a trapezoidal thing.", 
    "So VP was very quickly calculated as VI divided by 1", 
    "plus sRC, where s was j omega.", 
    "And, as I said multiple times, VP contains all the", 
    "information I need to know regarding the", 
    "steady state solution.", 
    "And not surprisingly, notice that the steady state solution", 
    "in my step 4 was obtained straightforwardly by taking", 
    "the magnitude of VP and the phase of", 
    "VP the complex amplitude.", 
    "And that gave rise to my output across the capacitor.", 
    "And I got the particular solution because I did not", 
    "care about the transients.", 
    "So what we're going to do next, O as a preview of", 
    "upcoming attractions, imagine this.", 
    "I'm going to show you something.", 
    "Imagine this.", 
    "Imagine if I could show you that you actually do not have", 
    "to do any of this stuff.", 
    "Imagine that.", 
    "Imagine that you don't have to do any of that stuff.", 
    "OK?", 
    "This will lead to the next big aha moment.", 
    "Imagine I could show you a way where you can directly write", 
    "down the complex amplitude VP just by observation.", 
    "Trivially write that down.", 
    "And then, once you write that down, because all the", 
    "information is contained in the complex amplitude VP, I", 
    "could very quickly write down the solution.", 
    "OK?", 
    "And so the question is, how do we do that?", 
    "So is there a path here that gives us a", 
    "really, really easy solution?", 
    "And we will see that in the next sequence."
