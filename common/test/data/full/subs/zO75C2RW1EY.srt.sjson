    "SPEAKER: OK, so let's now go ahead and look at the dynamic", 
    "behavior of my op amp circuit, where I have a positive", 
    "feedback, where gamma plus is the proportion of positive", 
    "feedback and gamma minus is the", 
    "proportion of negative feedback.", 
    "Again, v0 equals k times e raised to--", 
    "let me make this very clear-- e raised to minus t over", 
    "capital T, where capital T is given by--", 
    "let me write that down for you-- is given by RC divided", 
    "by the gain, A, times gamma minus minus gamma plus.", 
    "So let's take a look at how the system behaves with", 
    "respect to t, which in turn behaves on gamma minus and", 
    "gamma plus.", 
    "So I'm going to plot v0, which is equal to K, which is the", 
    "disturbance.", 
    "So K is minus the disturbance at v0.", 
    "So that's Ke raised to minus t divided by capital T. So this", 
    "is time t equal to 0, and also where v0 is 0.", 
    "And let us say that I have a small", 
    "disturbance, so this is k.", 
    "So this is my small disturbance.", 
    "So let's take a look at various situations.", 
    "Let's start with the very simple case that we all", 
    "understand.", 
    "So let's say we start with t being positive.", 
    "So let's start with the case that t is positive.", 
    "And t will be positive when gamma minus is greater than", 
    "gamma plus.", 
    "This is true when gamma minus is greater than gamma plus.", 
    "If we look to the right here, when gamma minus is greater", 
    "than gamma plus, then t is going to be positive.", 
    "So when gamma minus is greater than", 
    "gamma plus, t is positive.", 
    "And so what is v0?", 
    "So in this situation, v0 will be Ke raised to minus t by", 
    "capital T where t is positive.", 
    "So in that situation where t is positive, then I'm going to", 
    "get a behavior that looks like this.", 
    "OK, the behavior is going to look something like that.", 
    "OK, so what does that mean?", 
    "It means that if I perturb the op amp to a voltage gain, add", 
    "a bump in the voltage, if I bump up the voltage to k, and", 
    "if gamma minus is greater than gamma plus,", 
    "what does that mean?", 
    "It means that my negative feedback is stronger than my", 
    "positive feedback.", 
    "In other words, net, I am feeding more of the output to", 
    "the negative terminal than to the positive terminal.", 
    "So if my negative feedback is stronger than my positive", 
    "feedback, then what's going to happen is my output, k, is", 
    "going to very quickly go down to 0.", 
    "So that is my stable situation.", 
    "Not surprisingly, you recall, for op amps with negative", 
    "feedback, if I give a perturbation to the output,", 
    "very quickly that would go to 0 because of", 
    "the negative feedback.", 
    "So in this case, all I've done is added a resistor and a", 
    "capacitor in the op amp model, so things go more slowly.", 
    "And in this case, based on the RC time constant-- it's not", 
    "exactly RC time constant, the time constant relates to RC", 
    "divided by A times gamma minus, minus gamma plus.", 
    "With that time constant, I am going to go to 0, and my op", 
    "amp is going to stabilize.", 
    "This is good old negative feedback in action.", 
    "Not surprisingly, that is so, because gamma minus is greater", 
    "than gamma plus.", 
    "Now what happens when t is negative?", 
    "So in this situation, if gamma plus is greater than gamma", 
    "minus, in other words, if", 
    "positive feedback is stronger--", 
    "positive feedback dominant.", 
    "So if my positive feedback dominates the negative", 
    "feedback, OK, what happens?", 
    "Then t is negative.", 
    "Look here to the right.", 
    "If gamma plus is greater than gamma minus, then t is going", 
    "to be negative.", 
    "So if t is negative, then what is v0?", 
    "Then v0 be Ke raised to minus t over t.", 
    "That's my normal thing.", 
    "But if t is negative, then what do I get?", 
    "If t is negative, then I can rewrite this as Ke", 
    "raised to minus tt.", 
    "If 15 negative, I can say let me take the absolute value of", 
    "t and put a plus sign out here because the", 
    "minuses cancel out.", 
    "If t is negative, so in this case, t is negative, then the", 
    "negative in the t and the negative above cancel out, and", 
    "I can write it as Ke raised to t divided by capital T. What", 
    "that means is that, notice that I don't have a minus sign", 
    "in the exponential, and so therefore, my response is", 
    "going to spiral out of control in this manner.", 
    "So up there, the governing equation is given by Ke raised", 
    "to t divided by capital T. There's no minus sign there,", 
    "so this is an unstable situation.", 
    "So unlike the case where negative feedback was", 
    "stronger, in this case positive feedback dominates,", 
    "and because positive feedback dominates, a small change in", 
    "the output, K, spirals out of control and becomes much, much", 
    "larger, as you saw just now.", 
    "And then what happens when--", 
    "the natural thing to consider next is when gamma plus more", 
    "or less equal to gamma minus.", 
    "The last case is when gamma plus more or less equal to", 
    "gamma minus.", 
    "In this case, what happens?", 
    "In this case, t is very large.", 
    "So the equation to the right hand side. if gamma minus more", 
    "or less equals gamma plus, the time constant", 
    "is very, very large.", 
    "The time constant is very, very large, then v0 is still", 
    "Ke raised to minus t by capital T. But if the time", 
    "constant t is very, very large, then e raised to minus", 
    "t over capital T is more or less equal to 1, which means", 
    "v0, which implies that v0 is more or less equal to K for a", 
    "long period of time, which means the output is going to", 
    "stay like so.", 
    "The output is not going to change very much if gamma", 
    "minus and gamma plus are more or less equal.", 
    "This is called neutral equilibrium.", 
    "This is neutral equilibrium, and this is the case where t", 
    "is very, very large.", 
    "So what does the intuition behind this?", 
    "That says that if my negative feedback and positive feedback", 
    "are both more or less equal, and both are not strong enough", 
    "to overcome the other, then if I have a small change in the", 
    "output, then the output is going to", 
    "be very, very sluggish.", 
    "It's going to be very slothful.", 
    "And so the output will pretty much stay where it is and not", 
    "change a whole lot, and if it does, it will do", 
    "it very, very slowly.", 
    "If the positive feedback is slightly stronger, then my", 
    "output might gradually increase.", 
    "And if my negative feedback is stronger, then the output will", 
    "very, very gradually decay to a stable state.", 
    "So I want to draw your attention", 
    "to a mechanics analogy.", 
    "And a stable situation is as if you have a", 
    "little bowl like this.", 
    "And in the bowl, we place a marble.", 
    "And if I move the marble ever so slightly, if I give it a", 
    "nudge, it will gravitate back to a stable state after some", 
    "period of time.", 
    "The unstable situation looks like this, where I have a", 
    "situation where the marble is sitting up here.", 
    "And in this case, the marble is sitting up here, and it", 
    "could be sitting there forever.", 
    "If nothing happens, if I very, very carefully place the", 
    "marble at the tip of this little upside-down surface,", 
    "and if I don't have any noise, no wind, no nothing, nobody", 
    "talks, the marble will stay there for an", 
    "indefinite period of time.", 
    "But if I give it a nudge, ever so slight nudge, then it is", 
    "going to come careening down, either on the left hand side", 
    "or the right hand side.", 
    "That is the situation with the unstable equilibrium.", 
    "So that's stable equilibrium and unstable equilibrium.", 
    "And then finally, I have the third state, where gamma plus", 
    "more or less equal to gamma minus, and", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "That's neutral equilibrium, and that's as if I have a", 
    "surface that looks like this and I place a marble on it.", 
    "And if I give it a little tweak, it is just going to go", 
    "and stay in its new location.", 
    "It's going to move very, very slowly.", 
    "It is as if the curvature of the receptacle in which the", 
    "marble is is very, very small, almost flat.", 
    "In that case, the marble is going to move to its new", 
    "location and simply stay there.", 
    "So I hope that you have some intuition now of how the op", 
    "amp behaves with positive or negative feedback.", 
    "The key was to incorporate the dynamics of the op amp,", 
    "temporal dynamics using the capacitor model, and then we",
