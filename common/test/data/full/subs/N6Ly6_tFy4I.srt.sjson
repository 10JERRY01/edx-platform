    "SPEAKER 1: Let&#39;s now watch\nour next little video.", 
    "And in this video, I will\ntalk about logic gates.", 
    "So you already saw one logic--\nthis was the AND gate.", 
    "You saw its gate level\nrepresentation, the schematic,", 
    "and you also saw its truth table\nrepresentation, and you", 
    "also looked at a Boolean\nequation that we could write", 
    "as x dot y.", 
    "There are many other gates that\nwe can build, and as an", 
    "example, let me show you what\nis called a NOT gate.", 
    "So here&#39;s my input x, and I\nrepresent a NOT gate like so.", 
    "So here the circle implies\ninversion, so this is", 
    "called a NOT gate.", 
    "And the inversion is represented\nas follows.", 
    "So in truth table form, if I\nhave an input x, and here&#39;s my", 
    "output c, then inversion\nis pretty logical.", 
    "If I get a 0 at the input, the\nNOT gate would produce a 1 at", 
    "the output.", 
    "If I have a 1 at the input, then\nit would produce a 0 at", 
    "the output.", 
    "This is also called\nan inverter.", 
    "The Boolean equation for\nthis is written as z", 
    "is equal to x bar.", 
    "The far bar the x stands\nfor inversion.", 
    "And so here again, the gate\nlevel representation has a", 
    "circle, representing\ninversion.", 
    "So if I did not have the circle\nhere, and just had the", 
    "right triangle as something\nlike this, then", 
    "this is called a buffer.", 
    "And all that a buffer does is it\ntakes x, and produces x at", 
    "the output.", 
    "There is no inversion\ngoing on.", 
    "And oftentimes, these buffers\nare used in digital circuits", 
    "to make a signal stronger.", 
    "So if you think that the signal\non a wire drooping-- so", 
    "let&#39;s say you put out a VOH\nat the output someplace.", 
    "So I give you a long wire, you\nput VOH on the wire at some", 
    "point, and for whatever reason,\nthere&#39;s some noise on", 
    "the wire, and at some point, the\nsignal tends to get closer", 
    "and closer to one of the\nthreshold values.", 
    "In this case, close to\nthe VIH, which is the", 
    "input height threshold.", 
    "And let&#39;s say you have a much\nlonger distance to go, and you", 
    "say, hm, if the signal keeps\ngoing, then it may become", 
    "invalid down the road.", 
    "So what you may end up\ndoing is decide to", 
    "put a buffer in here.", 
    "So if the input is x, the\noutput is also x.", 
    "But what the buffer does is\nthat it can strengthen the", 
    "signal coming out and make that\nVOH again, so that you", 
    "could continue communicating for\nlonger distances without", 
    "the signal getting corrupted\nand going into", 
    "the forbidden region.", 
    "So that&#39;s a buffer.", 
    "I can also build up other\nkinds of games.", 
    "So for instance, I can take my\nAND gate that I showed you", 
    "before, with inputs x and y, and\nin this case, I can apply", 
    "the inversion before giving\nyou the output z.", 
    "So here, for a gate like this,\nI have a truth table that I", 
    "can write x, y, and z, and\nthis kind of gate is", 
    "called a NAND gate.", 
    "In fact, if people ask for a\ncouple of seconds, and this is", 
    "a combination of an AND followed\nby an inversion.", 
    "So let me give you a few seconds\nto think about what", 
    "the output might look like\nbefore I go ahead and answer.",
