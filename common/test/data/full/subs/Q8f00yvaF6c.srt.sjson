    "SPEAKER: As shown here on the right-hand side, I replaced my", 
    "MOSFET with the dependent current source.", 
    "And this was in the saturation region of operation.", 
    "And by the way, over time I'm going to stop saying", 
    "saturation region of operation and understand that the", 
    "constraints apply, but you have to be very", 
    "careful about it.", 
    "This dependent source model applies only in the saturation", 
    "region of operation.", 
    "And also remember that V0 equals VDS for just this", 
    "connection, and VGS equals VI.", 
    "Again, want to emphasize that in general these", 
    "two may not be true.", 
    "And just to give you an example, supposing I build a", 
    "circuit that looks like this.", 
    "Suppose I build a circuit that looks like this.", 
    "So where I have a VI, I have some R. And in this case, I", 
    "have some V0.", 
    "This is my drain.", 
    "This is my source.", 
    "In this case, VDS is not equal to V0.", 
    "So this is just a quick little aside to make sure you don't", 
    "get carried away with V0 equals VDS all the time.", 
    "Just in this case, that is true.", 
    "So having replaced the MOSFET with its dependent source", 
    "model for the saturation region on operation, one of", 
    "the techniques I can use to analyze it is the--", 
    "I can apply the analytical method.", 
    "And you've seen this before.", 
    "We've gone through a dependent source analysis with the", 
    "analytical and graphical methods.", 
    "Just that in this case, I'm going to be", 
    "explicitly using VT.", 
    "That's the one difference between the analysis we did", 
    "before and now.", 
    "Everything else should be the same.", 
    "So in terms of analyzing the circuit, let's say I've asked", 
    "you to find out V0 versus VI.", 
    "How does the output V0 change with respect to VI?", 
    "So V0 and VI.", 
    "V0 depends on VI.", 
    "So what does that dependence look like?", 
    "So for the analytical method, it's pretty simple.", 
    "I go ahead and use the node method.", 
    "And applying the node method at the node with voltage V0, I", 
    "sum the currents leaving the node.", 
    "So the current going up is V0 minus VS divide by RL.", 
    "The current going down is iDS and both must sum to 0.", 
    "That's from the node method.", 
    "Then I'm going to multiply throughout by RL.", 
    "So I multiply throughout by RL.", 
    "And I move VS to the right-hand side.", 
    "By doing so, what do I get?", 
    "I get V0 equals VS minus iDS RL.", 
    "So I can simplify it further and what I can do in", 
    "particular is I can replace iDS with the value for iDS", 
    "from out here.", 
    "Recall in the node method, you substitute for the currents by", 
    "using the element relationships.", 
    "And so based on that, I get V0 is VS minus", 
    "some function of iDS.", 
    "And that is I replace it with the iDS relation, K divided by", 
    "2 VI minus VT all squared times RL.", 
    "And again, it's always good to remember that this is true for", 
    "VI greater than or equal to VT and for V0 greater than or", 
    "equal to VI minus VT.", 
    "And that simply captures the fact that this is operating in", 
    "its saturation region.", 
    "Now, I also know that when VI is less than VT, the", 
    "MOSFET turns off.", 
    "So for that case, V0 will be equal to VS. So notice here,", 
    "when the MOSFET turns off, I replace it with--", 
    "as part of the switch current source model, remember it's a", 
    "current source for VI greater than VT.", 
    "But it's a switch, off switch, for VI less than VT.", 
    "So for VI less than VT in the SCS model, the MOSFET is an", 
    "off switch.", 
    "And so this is off.", 
    "Then there's no connection here.", 
    "There's no current flowing down.", 
    "And so all of the VS appears at the output.", 
    "And so I get V0 equals VS. So there is my relation", 
    "between V0 and VI.", 
    "So before I move onto the next step, let me just mark one", 
    "equation here.", 
    "I will need it later.", 
    "Let me mark this equation as B. And let me just put a nice", 
    "little green square around it.", 
    "And also recall we will use this other", 
    "thing again as well.", 
    "Notice that my current equation is marked with an A.", 
    "So I really want this to be A. That's a current as a function", 
    "of the input voltage.", 
    "And I have marked as B my output relation, V0 in terms", 
    "of iDS and RL.", 
    "So let's move onto the next step and go from there."
