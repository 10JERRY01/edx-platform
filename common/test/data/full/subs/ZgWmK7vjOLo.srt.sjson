    "So here&#39;s this huge\nThevenin trick.", 
    "If you like, you can call it a\nThevenin hack, if you will.", 
    "But let&#39;s say for example,\nI have some funky device.", 
    "So let&#39;s say, some\nfunky device, F.", 
    "And then let&#39;s say\nF is connected to", 
    "some arbitrary network.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I&#39;m just sitting here and\ndrawing out something.", 
    "Some arbitrary network.", 
    "But remember, it&#39;s\na linear network.", 
    "I can keep going like this.", 
    "I can just go on and on.", 
    "And so on.", 
    "So, some arbitrary funky network\nthat is connecting my", 
    "device, F. What this trick says\nis that I can cut this", 
    "device out here.", 
    "And let&#39;s say I place\nthe device F here.", 
    "OK, so that&#39;s the cut piece of\nthe device that I&#39;ve placed on", 
    "the right-hand side.", 
    "I can take the rest of the\nnetwork and replace that", 
    "entire network with its Thevenin\nequivalent for the", 
    "purposes of analyzing\nthat device.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So, the voltage V and R. And\nthese two will be equivalent", 
    "to the extent that I want to\nfigure out the properties of", 
    "the device.", 
    "This is absolutely,", 
    "absolutely, absolutely, amazing.", 
    "So whenever you see funky little\ndevices, whether it&#39;s", 
    "non-linear devices-- and we&#39;ll\nsee some other very", 
    "interesting devices later\non in this course--", 
    "what you can do is isolate that\ndevice and replace the", 
    "rest of the network with the\nThevenin equivalent if that", 
    "network is linear.", 
    "You can do the same thing, and\nin some cases it may be", 
    "preferable, to replace the rest\nof the circuit with a", 
    "node method.", 
    "Either way is fine.", 
    "You can do a node or a Thevenin,\nand the two are", 
    "equivalent.", 
    "All right.", 
    "I think with that, we are ready\nto start talking about",

    "device, and also enabled the\nvoltage at the terminal at the", 
    "node between the resistor\nand the voltage source.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So what I want to do now is\nstart with applying the node", 
    "method to this device, and then\nsee how we can go ahead", 
    "and analyze.", 
    "As before, the device equation\nis iD equals a raised to bvD,",

    "method for this device.", 
    "And remember again, the node\nmethod applies for linear or", 
    "nonlinear circuits.", 
    "Once we are in ECS playground,\nwe can go ahead and apply the", 
    "node method, which\nderives directly", 
    "from the KVL KCL method.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So there is just one\nnode here, the node", 
    "with voltage, VD.", 
    "And let me go ahead\nand write the node", 
    "equation for that node.", 
    "Let me sum the currents\nleaving the node.", 
    "And so the current leaving in\nthe left-hand direction is", 
    "simply given by VD minus\ncapital V divided by R.", 
    "And I sum the current\ngoing out of", 
    "the node going downwards.", 
    "And that is plus iD equals 0,\nwhere according to the node", 
    "method, I replace iD with the\nexpression, the device", 
    "relation, for the current iD,\ngiven by a raised to b--", 
    "I&#39;m sorry.", 
    "Let me do this again here.", 
    "Where iD equals ae\nraised to bVD,", 
    "where a and b are constants.", 
    "So that is my node equation.", 
    "And just for fun to show you a\nvariety of methods of solving", 
    "nonlinear circuits, let me not\nsubstitute the device equation", 
    "into the node equation\nright away.", 
    "Let me leave it explicitly\noutside for now.", 
    "Let me label this as equation\none, and let me label this as", 
    "equation two.", 
    "Equation two is simply the\ndevice equation, which is the", 
    "same as the equation here.", 
    "And equation one is\nthe node equation.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So what do you see here?", 
    "So you see two equations,\none and two.", 
    "So you see two unknowns.", 
    null, 
    "OK.", 
    "So I should be able\nto solve this.", 
    "But notice my second equation\nis non-linear.", 
    "It&#39;s not a linear equation.", 
    "And so therefore, I can&#39;t use\nsome of the simple ideas of", 
    "solving simultaneous\nequations.", 
    "I have to go with some more\nsophisticated methods.", 
    "So there are a couple of ways in\nwhich you can solve this in", 
    "an analytical method.", 
    "We&#39;ll look at other graphical\nand other techniques later.", 
    "But in an analytical method,\nin an analytical method, I", 
    "would like to solve this by\none of two approaches.", 
    "I can just trial and error.", 
    "Or I can use a variety of\nnumerical techniques.", 
    "So again, 6002x is\nnot about how to", 
    "solve non-linear equations.", 
    "So don&#39;t worry about that.", 
    "Just suffice it to say that\nonce you have these two", 
    "equations, we somehow\nneed to solve them.", 
    "And 6002 is not about solving\nnonlinear equations.", 
    "So don&#39;t worry about\nhow to do it.", 
    "I&#39;ll show you a couple of\nmethods, but you really would", 
    "not be responsible for\nsolving nonlinear", 
    "equations in general.", 
    "So let&#39;s look at a couple\nof techniques.",
