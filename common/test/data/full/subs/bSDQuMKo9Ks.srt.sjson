    "SPEAKER: All right, I hope you had a chance to try it out and", 
    "find the polynomial in s that s must satisfy in order for Ae", 
    "raised ST to be a viable solution of", 
    "the homogeneous equation.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do that for you.", 
    "What I'll do is substitute that in here and find out what", 
    "polynomial must be satisfied.", 
    "OK, so let me start.", 
    "If I substitute Ae raised to st in here I get 1 by LC e", 
    "raised to st. OK, no big deal.", 
    "If I substitute it in here, I get R divided by L, A, and", 
    "then when I differentiate e raised to st I get se raised", 
    "to st. And then out here I get A and then I differentiate d", 
    "squared vH by dt squared, the second derivative of Ae raised", 
    "to st will be s squared e raised to st.", 
    "So let me collect those terms here and write this down.", 
    "So As squared e raised to st plus R divided by L se raised", 
    "to st plus 1 by LC e raised to st. And that is equal to 0.", 
    "Oh, I forgot the A here and I forgot the A here.", 
    "So let me stick that back in there.", 
    "All right, so ignoring the trivial A equals 0 case, I can", 
    "cancel Ae raised to st from both sides.", 
    "So A cancels out this stuff, cancel out this, and", 
    "I cancel out this.", 
    "What am I left with?", 
    "I am left with s squared plus R/L s plus 1 divided by LC is", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "So this is my characteristic equation.", 
    "This is the equation in s that is a second order equation.", 
    "This is the equation that must be satisfied in order for Ae", 
    "raised to st to be a solution of the right form for the", 
    "homogeneous equation.", 
    "I'd also like you to stare at this for a second and compare", 
    "this to the differential equation.", 
    "Again, notice a couple of things.", 
    "You R/L here and you see R/L here.", 
    "Also notice, where do you see the s squareds and s's and how", 
    "do those relate to first and second derivatives of vH.", 
    "OK, so stare at that for a few seconds and then I'm going to", 
    "switch to explaining and trying to give you a sense of", 
    "what is really going on here.", 
    "So feel free to hit the pause button and think about this", 
    "characteristic equation and see how it relates to the", 
    "homogeneous equation.", 
    "And then we could move on and I can describe what is really", 
    "going on here.", 
    "OK, so this is my step 2B which is to develop the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "And we saw that it was s squared divided by R/L s plus", 
    "1 by LC equal to 0.", 
    "This is the characteristic equation.", 
    "This is an extremely, extremely important equation.", 
    "You will see in the end of the sequence that once you can", 
    "write down this characteristic equation for the second order", 
    "circuit of this form, for example, you will be able to", 
    "figure out its dynamics just by observation of the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "So let me write this equation in more of a canonic form.", 
    "So in a canonic form we write this as s squared plus 2 alpha", 
    "s plus omega0 squared equals 0.", 
    "And this is the canonic form of the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "And so compare these terms here.", 
    "So let's compare and let's change colors here for fun.", 
    "Let's pick green.", 
    "So compare this here and these here.", 
    "So what do we find?", 
    "In the canonic form, omega0 in the canonic form is simply 1", 
    "by square root of LC.", 
    "And alpha in the canonic form for the circuit is", 
    "R divided by 2L.", 
    "So I could take this canonic form and for series RLC", 
    "circuit omega0 is 1 by square of LC and alpha is equal to R", 
    "divided by 2L.", 
    "That's my step 2 of 2B of the homogeneous solution process.", 
    "Next, let me get to step 2C, the third step up the", 
    "homogeneous solution.", 
    "The third step was simply go find the roots of the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "So for as long as possible I'm going to work with the canonic", 
    "form so that I'm not carrying around R divided by L's and", 
    "square roots of LCs and so on around.", 
    "I'll just work with the canonic alpha and omega0 as", 
    "that will give us a lot more insight.", 
    "OK, so this is a second order equation.", 
    "And so I could directly write its roots as s1 equals.", 
    "If the coefficient of s squared is denoted a, the", 
    "coefficient of s is denoted b, and the constant that was", 
    "denoted c, then the solution is simply minus b plus or", 
    "minus square root of b squared minus 4ac the whole thing", 
    "divided by 2a.", 
    "So accordingly, in this case minus b is", 
    "simply minus 2 alpha.", 
    "There's a 2 at the end that I'm going to divide throughout", 
    "by, so I get minus b is minus 2 alpha here plus.", 
    "And I have a second case, so there's a minus 2", 
    "alpha plus or minus.", 
    "So the square root of, this is two roots so I'll", 
    "write s1 and s2.", 
    "So the plus root it will be b squared,", 
    "which is 4 alpha squared.", 
    "And again, rather than carry these 2's and 4's around, I'm", 
    "just going to divide out throughout by 2 as I go along.", 
    "So let me just cancel this out here.", 
    "Let me just clean it up a little bit.", 
    "Let me cancel out the 2 here, cancel the 2 here, and I'll", 
    "divide out by 2 under the square root as well.", 
    "So b squared is 4 alpha squared and divide that by 4", 
    "because I'm bringing the 2 inside.", 
    "That simply gives me alpha squared and then minus 4ac.", 
    "Minus 4ac is simply minus 4 omega0 squared.", 
    "And I divide that out by 2 again so I get omega0 squared.", 
    "And out here I get alpha squared minus omega0 squared.", 
    "OK, so there you go.", 
    "So my two roots of the characteristic equation are", 
    "minus alpha plus alpha squared minus omega0 squared and minus", 
    "alpha minus the square root of alpha squared", 
    "minus omega0 squared.", 
    "That was step 3 of 2C, step 2 of the solution to the", 
    "homogeneous equation.", 
    "And then I'm ready for my step 4.", 
    "I've summarized all that we've seen in these homogeneous", 
    "solution steps so far.", 
    "This was my homogeneous equation here.", 
    "I then wrote down the characteristic equation here", 
    "by assuming a solution of the form Ae raised to st. I got", 
    "two roots of the characteristic equation, where", 
    "omega0 and alpha are given here.", 
    "So the final step, I go ahead and write down the general", 
    "solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "I can simply write that down as, if you recall, it was", 
    "going to be A1e raised to s1 t plus A2 e raised to s2 t.", 
    "And in this case, since we know what s1 and s2 are, I can", 
    "directly write down.", 
    "So this was going to vH, I can write done vH equals A1 e", 
    "raised to minus alpha plus the square root of alpha squared", 
    "minus omega0 squared plus A2 e raised to minus alpha minus", 
    "square root of alpha squared minus omega0 squared.", 
    "So this is my general solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "So here I have my general solution to", 
    "the homogeneous equation.", 
    "Again, remember this is not the total solution.", 
    "This is just this solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "I still have these two unknowns A1 and A2 which I am", 
    "going to find from the initial conditions once I create the", 
    "total solution.", 
    "So let's dive into writing the total solution by summing the", 
    "particular and homogeneous solutions."
