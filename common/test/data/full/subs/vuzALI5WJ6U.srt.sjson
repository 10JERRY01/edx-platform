    "SPEAKER: OK, so I'm ready to get back to my", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "And recall the four steps of solving the differential", 
    "equation here.", 
    "First was set up the differential equation.", 
    "Second was find vp.", 
    "And notice I found vp by taking this sneaky approach.", 
    "And then I need to get down to third and fourth steps.", 
    "The third step is to find vH, the homogeneous solution.", 
    "And then I need to find the total solution as the sum of", 
    "the homogeneous and that particular solutions.", 
    "So as my third step of the differential equation", 
    "solution, let me go ahead and find vH.", 
    "And so I've written down the homogeneous equation for you,", 
    "where I set the derive to zero and vH is the solution.", 
    "I won't go ahead and solve it.", 
    "But you've done this before.", 
    "I'm going to write down the solution by inspection.", 
    "And the solution is simply vH equals A e raised to minus t", 
    "divided by RC.", 
    "If you recall, we had done this the last time around.", 
    "And you can substitute this into the equation and confirm", 
    "for yourselves that this solution works.", 
    "So the homogeneous solution is A e raised to minus", 
    "t divided by RC.", 
    "So I have that.", 
    "And, finally, let me go to step four.", 
    "So step four is my total solution.", 
    "And to get that step, I simply write v equals", 
    "vp divided by vH.", 
    "So let me write my total solution.", 
    "vp I obtained from the sneaky path.", 
    "And if you recall, it was vi divided the square root of 1", 
    "plus omega squared R squared C squared times cosine omega t", 
    "plus phi, where phi was the inverse of omega", 
    "R minus omega RC.", 
    "So this was my particular solution.", 
    "And my homogeneous solution was A e raised to minus t", 
    "divided by RC.", 
    "So now here's my total solution.", 
    "And so I can find out the remaining constants, which is", 
    "really just A here, from the initial condition.", 
    "So given that v of 0 equals 0--", 
    "and this was for time t equal to zero--", 
    "I can very quickly find my A.", 
    "And if I substitute v to be 0, then at time t equal to zero,", 
    "this part goes to 1.", 
    "So A is simply--", 
    "and cosine omega t plus phi goes to cosine phi--", 
    "so A becomes simply minus vi divided by this stuff here", 
    "times cosine phi.", 
    "So Ai is vi divided by square root of 1 plus omega squared R", 
    "squared C squared times cosine phi.", 
    "So that is the complete solution.", 
    "Done.", 
    "Phew.", 
    "That was painful.", 
    "So those are the four steps of the", 
    "differential equation solution.", 
    "And the sneaky path really enabled me to do step two in", 
    "rather easy manner."
