    "SPEAKER 1: So let&#39;s start with\ntrying to get some insight", 
    "into the small signal method.", 
    "I&#39;m looking for your help in\ntrying to figure out a", 
    "technique in order to get a\nlinear response from something", 
    "that is highly nonlinear.", 
    "OK.", 
    "What I&#39;d like you to do is\nfocus at this point.", 
    "I would like you to focus at\nthis little point, this little", 
    "segment of this curve.", 
    "OK, so this is the iV curve,\nand this is the 0 point.", 
    "I&#39;d like you to focus on this\nlittle point, and think of", 
    "that point centered around\nsome value, VD.", 
    "And there&#39;s some corresponding\nvalue of ID at that point.", 
    "So have the small, little\nsegment here.", 
    "And I want you to\nfocus on that.", 
    "So I want you to look at\nthat point carefully.", 
    "Focus on that point exactly.", 
    "What does it look like?", 
    "Does it say something to you?", 
    "What does that segment really,\nreally look like?", 
    "And I promised you the\nZen thing here.", 
    "So start focusing really\ndeeply on that point.", 
    "Focus really deeply on that\npoint at that little segment.", 
    "What does that look like?", 
    "So this is my nonlinear curve.", 
    "But what does this little\nsegment here remind you of?", 
    "What does it look like?", 
    "Well, if you look at it\ncarefully enough and do the", 
    "Zen thing, as I promised, the\nsmall region, amazingly", 
    "enough, looks more\nor less linear.", 
    "So if you look at the small,\nlittle line here, that small,", 
    "little line there looks\nmore or less linear.", 
    "And that little segment is\nabout the point VD, ID.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So that is a key piece of\ninsight that I&#39;m going to", 
    "exploit and go berserk with it,\nand try to really develop", 
    "linear responses that are of\nnon-linear circuits with that", 
    "little piece of insight.", 
    "And what is that insight?", 
    "The insight is that if I take\nthis nonlinear curve and look", 
    "at that small segment of a line\nand focus on it, it looks", 
    "more or less linear about\nthe point ID and VD.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So how do I relate that to\nelectrical engineering, and", 
    "how do I get some response\nout of that?", 
    "Well, in order to do so, let&#39;s\nlook at this picture.", 
    "So in this picture, I&#39;ve drawn\nyou a little segment of line,", 
    "and a little approximate\nline there.", 
    "And that looks more\nor less linear.", 
    "And what I&#39;m going to do now is,\nif you look at my input,", 
    "this is my input here.", 
    "And clearly that piece\nof input as placed is", 
    "articulating this large region\nof the curve, particularly in", 
    "the region where I&#39;m not getting\nany particularly", 
    "useful response.", 
    "So as a first step, what I&#39;m\ngoing to do is the following.", 
    "I would really like this input\nvariation that I have here to", 
    "somehow articulate this\nregion of the curve.", 
    "I want that input to meander in\na way that this region of", 
    "the curve is exploited.", 
    "OK, how do I do that?", 
    "Well, I can do that by somehow\ntaking this curve and moving", 
    "the whole curve up.", 
    "So by somehow taking this input\nand boosting the input", 
    "up somehow, I haven&#39;t told you\nhow I do it, but if I boost it", 
    "out somehow, then I might\nbe able to get this", 
    "close to this regime.", 
    "And in this particular\nsituation, let&#39;s assume that I", 
    "want to boost it at an offset\ngiven by capital VD.", 
    "If I assume that this point here\nis at VD higher than the", 
    "ground value.", 
    "OK.", 
    "How do I do the next step?", 
    "So, so far what I&#39;ve done is\nI&#39;ve moved input and boosted", 
    "it up such that it is in\nthe vicinity of VD.", 
    "It seems to meander in the\nvicinity of VD, but now I&#39;m", 
    "articulating this region\nof the curve.", 
    "But how do I get it\nto articulate", 
    "just a small region?", 
    "Think about it.", 
    "How do I get this big curve\nfor my input voltage to", 
    "articulate about just this\nsmall region here?", 
    "Well, let&#39;s just\nmake it small.", 
    "So I take my big input, and I\nmake my input a lot smaller so", 
    "that it is small enough that\nits peak-to-peak voltage", 
    "exactly matches that small\nsegment of line", 
    "that I cared about.", 
    "And by doing so, let&#39;s say that\nthis value I call vd.", 
    "Let me just notate it with\na small v and a small d", 
    "just to show that.", 
    "And this is a very\nsmall value.", 
    "And then, I&#39;ve done\ntwo things.", 
    "One is I have moved this way\nfrom the small vd by a", 
    "distance, VD, from the origin.", 
    "And then I have made vd itself\nextremely small.", 
    "And by making it small, I am\nthen articulating just that", 
    "small segment of the VI curve\nof the exponential device.", 
    "OK, so this is still\ntime as before.", 
    "So what happens now?", 
    "So now my vd is really small,\nand it&#39;s articulating the", 
    "small region.", 
    "So what does the output\nlook like?", 
    "So if I look at my output\nin this situation--", 
    "by output I mean the current ID\nthat corresponds to the VD", 
    "that I&#39;ve applied--", 
    "it looks like this.", 
    "For changes in the vd here,\nmy output looks like this.", 
    "My output will now correspond to\na change in the value that", 
    "is also sinusoidal.", 
    "And the reason is that this\nis more or less linear.", 
    "And notice here that this will\nalso be centered around some", 
    "point, and that point here is\nat an ID offset about 0.", 
    "And the value, the meandering,\nhas a--", 
    "it&#39;s a voltage.", 
    "I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s a current\nin this case.", 
    "It&#39;s a small current, ID, that\nmeanders about the offset ID.", 
    "Capital I, capital D. Like I\nsaid, this is my time axis.", 
    "Then I&#39;m going to get\na small current id.", 
    "And again, I use the notation\na small i, small d, to show", 
    "that this is going to be\na small change in id", 
    "corresponding to a small\nchange in vd.", 
    "So what have I really\ndone here?", 
    "What I&#39;ve done is I first of all\nboosted my input signal by", 
    "a value, VD, and then I have\nshrunk it to a small", 
    "value, small vd.", 
    "So I boosted it up and shrunk it\nto a small value so that it", 
    "meandered across the small\nregion of the ID curve.", 
    "And then, corresponding to that\nmeandering of the small", 
    "vd signal, I got a small current\nid, small id, that", 
    "reflected the sinusoidal vd.", 
    "And I called that small\ni, small d.", 
    "My current id.", 
    "And that current was also\nat an offset ID.", 
    "And the reason is that I have an\noffset here of VD, and that", 
    "gives me a corresponding\noffset ID here.", 
    "So notice that by boosting my\nsignal, by adding a DC offset", 
    "VD to my signal and then\nshrinking it, I&#39;m now, in an", 
    "electrical engineering sense,\nable to exploit this region of", 
    "the curve that looks more\nor less linear.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So as you can see, I&#39;m leaning\ntowards exactly how I use my", 
    "nonlinear circuit in order\nto get a linear response.", 
    "So so far I&#39;ve been dealing with\nit in a graphical sense.", 
    "I first showed you that a small\npiece of the curve looks", 
    "linear here, and then I said\nthe way I can physically", 
    "accomplish that is by shrinking\nmy input VD and then", 
    "boosting it all the way up.", 
    "And just so there&#39;s no\nconfusion, VI and VD are the", 
    "same thing because notice\nthat this small voltage", 
    "here, VI, equals VD.", 
    "So whatever I say about\nVD here applies to", 
    "the VI that I&#39;m using.",
