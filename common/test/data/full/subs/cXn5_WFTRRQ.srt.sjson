    "SPEAKER 1: What I'm going to do now is I'm going to try to", 
    "build a circuit that uses positive feedback and gives me", 
    "an interesting property.", 
    "I don't want that flippant behavior that I saw in the", 
    "open loop op amp, and I want to build some kind of a", 
    "competitor that has the property that once I cross", 
    "from positive to negative--", 
    "I remember that I came from the positive territory,", 
    "crossed to the negative, and then if I immediately make", 
    "small crossings back, somehow the op amp remembers that, and", 
    "doesn't cause a change at the output.", 
    "So let's build a circuit to see, so you understand better", 
    "what I'm talking about.", 
    "So here's my op amp, I'm going to connect a vi as in the", 
    "past. And what I'm going to do is apply positive feedback.", 
    "In this case, I have a resistance R2, a resistance", 
    "R1, and I'm going to connect the voltage divider between R2", 
    "and R1 to the positive terminal.", 
    "And this is my output v0 taken with respect to ground.", 
    "For this example, let us assume, just for fun, that R1", 
    "is equal to R2, so that, at the center here, this is v0", 
    "divided by 2 where R1 equals R2.", 
    "And let's assume, to be specific, VS", 
    "is equal to 15 volts.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Let me switch colors here and go to blue.", 
    "So let me do a little mechanical simulation for you", 
    "and simulate what happens in this particular situation.", 
    "So let's say to start, as my step one, step one, let's say", 
    "vi is at 0 volts.", 
    "OK, step one, vi is at 0 volts.", 
    "And recall that in these positive feedback circuits,", 
    "depending on how the noise may have happened, the output", 
    "could be at plus 15 or minus 15 volts, because VS and the", 
    "two supplies are VS and minus VS at 15 and minus 15.", 
    "So in this case, let us assume that somehow the circuit is at", 
    "15 volts at the output.", 
    "It's at plus 15 volts at the output.", 
    "This is how my life starts.", 
    "So the input is at 0 volts, vi, and the output somehow has", 
    "gotten to 15 volts and it's saturated there at 15.", 
    "Then let's see what happens.", 
    "So now at the v-plus terminal, so this is my v minus and this", 
    "is my v plus.", 
    "So let's say, because the output is at 15 volts, v plus", 
    "is therefore at 7.5 volts.", 
    "No magic here.", 
    "At my third step, I can determine that v plus will be", 
    "at 7.5 volts.", 
    "So what happens in this situation?", 
    "In general, recall that, in general, v plus will be v0", 
    "divided by R1 plus R2 times R1.", 
    "OK, that's what v plus is going to be.", 
    "But in our situation, because R1 is picked to be equal to", 
    "R2, v plus is simply equal to v0 when R1 equals R2.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So now, as my third step, I know that v", 
    "plus is at 7.5 volts.", 
    "So let's stare at this.", 
    "So v plus is at 7.5, v minus is zero, and so, healthily,", 
    "v0, because of positive feedback, v0 is at plus 15.", 
    "Now supposing vi changes.", 
    "Supposing vi goes more and more negative.", 
    "Will that cause any change in the output?", 
    "So let's say vi goes more and more negative, to minus 1", 
    "volts, minus 2 volts.", 
    "That is not going to change the output because v plus", 
    "minus v minus is still positive, and so therefore v0", 
    "will stay at 15 volts.", 
    "Let's do the other thing.", 
    "Let's say v0 rises.", 
    "So let's say v0 is rising--", 
    "vi is rising, I'm sorry.", 
    "So when vi is 0 volts, let's say vi goes to 1 volt.", 
    "If vi goes to 1 volt, still nothing happens, because v", 
    "plus is greater than v minus.", 
    "As long as v plus is greater than v minus, the output will", 
    "stay at 15 volts.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So vi goes from 1 volt to 2 volts to 3 volts to 4 volts to", 
    "5 volts to 6 volts to 7 volts.", 
    "Let's say it gets to 7 volts.", 
    "When vi is at 7 volts--", 
    "let's say vi is at 7 volts, v plus is at 7.5 still.", 
    "v plus is at 7.5.", 
    "So v plus minus v minus is still 0.5, plus 0.5.", 
    "So therefore, when I amplify the plus 0.5 by 80,", 
    "amplification could be 10 to the sixth, output is still", 
    "going to be 15.", 
    "No change.", 
    "OK, now comes the interesting part.", 
    "What if vi keeps increasing, and vi eventually gets to", 
    "something higher than 7.5 volts?", 
    "So vi gets to be higher than 7.5 volts, that's", 
    "it gets to 7.6 volts.", 
    "So now when vi is greater than v plus, what happens?", 
    "So now, when vi becomes greater than v plus, now v", 
    "plus minus v minus is negative.", 
    "Recall if this is amplification A, the voltage", 
    "here, V0, is always going to be A times v", 
    "plus minus v minus.", 
    "That has to be true.", 
    "In this case, if v minus goes to 7.6 volts, plus 7.6 volts,", 
    "then v plus minus v minus is negative.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So when I multiply the negative 0.1 volts by a huge", 
    "gain, what's going to happen?", 
    "What's going to happen is that, as a next step, my", 
    "output is going to swing negative and", 
    "become minus 15 volts.", 
    "So as soon as vi reaches plus 7.6 volts, the output is going", 
    "to swing hugely negative, and hit the negative", 
    "rail, minus 15 volts."
