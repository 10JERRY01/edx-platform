    "SPEAKER 1: So I'm going to show you very quickly a couple", 
    "of examples of waveforms, one that goes like this, and one", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "This is when I start with some value v0, and I", 
    "don't apply any input.", 
    "It will decay down to 0.", 
    "t, t, vc, vc.", 
    "So if I apply 0 for vi, then this should simply decay down", 
    "to nothing over time.", 
    "And if I apply some vi, but there's no state on the", 
    "capacitor, then that same equation is going", 
    "to look like this.", 
    "You can go and confirm for yourselves that when I apply", 
    "some input, but the capacitor has zero state, I start with", 
    "0, I finish up with vi, and my waveform looks like this.", 
    "So there you go.", 
    "That's the first one.", 
    "The second one, we're going to have five ohms on the", 
    "capacitor--", 
    "I'm sorry.", 
    "We're going to have--", 
    "right, five ohms on the capacitor and no input.", 
    "And then watch.", 
    "So assume that our time, t, equals 0.", 
    "I take away an input, [? short ?] my voltage--", 
    "the input voltage to ground, for example.", 
    "Apply 0 volts.", 
    "You see the decay from 5 volts to 0 volts.", 
    "And in the first case, I start with 0 volts on my capacitor.", 
    "I apply input of 5 volts, and notice that t equals 0, and", 
    "notice that the capacitor rises up to that level.", 
    "So notice that these circuits with capacitors and resistors", 
    "are typified by waveforms that are exponential rises and", 
    "exponential decays.", 
    "We'll see more of that next time."
