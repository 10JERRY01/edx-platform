    "SPEAKER 1: Well, I hope you enjoyed that demo.", 
    "It's always fun when, as I increase the frequency of my", 
    "input, my power increases.", 
    "OK?", 
    "It's rather counter-intuitive as to why it is the case that", 
    "when I apply a changing input because of the capacitance at", 
    "the output, the power consumed by my gate increases.", 
    "OK, now let's do a really fun little exercise.", 
    "I have a question for you.", 
    "What does our previous style of building logic gates have", 
    "to do with the sun?", 
    "What does the sun have in common with the kind of logic", 
    "gates we have been building so far?", 
    "And what are the kind of logic gates we've", 
    "been building so far?", 
    "This kind.", 
    "You have an input vi, you have an output vo, load resistor", 
    "RL, VS, and I model my MOSFET as a switch with some", 
    "resistance R on.", 
    "The key is this little RL here.", 
    "I have a pull up RL in my pull up path so that I have,", 
    "whenever the MOSFET it is on, there is a direct path for the", 
    "VS to ground through my resistor RL.", 
    "That was a static power.", 
    "Recall the static power, VS squared divided by 2 RL.", 
    "That is a little problem.", 
    "That's a hint for you.", 
    "So what does the previous style of logic--", 
    "where I have this pull-up resistor here--", 
    "what does this have to do with the sun?", 
    "And I want you to figure it out for yourselves, and we", 
    "give you a fun little exercise that you should try out next,", 
    "and then I'll go ahead and do the calculations for you."
