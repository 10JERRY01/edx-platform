    "to you as you do the course.", 
    "Now, this is important\ninformation not just on the", 
    "course itself, but also on\nhow to use the system.", 
    "So for example, at the top\nof the screen, you", 
    "see a bunch of tabs.", 
    "You are in Courseware\nright now.", 
    "Courseware is where you will\nspend most of your time during", 
    "the course.", 
    "The Courseware section contains\nthe following things", 
    "in the left-hand column.", 
    "For example, it contains\nthese two things", 
    "called lecture sequences.", 
    "Each lecture sequence contains a\nset of short videos with the", 
    "concepts, and theory, and\npractical ideas, and so on.", 
    "And those are interweaved\nwith exercises.", 
    "So there will be videos and\nthey&#39;ll be followed by", 
    "exercises that you can do to\npractice what you&#39;ve learned", 
    "in the videos.", 
    "You will see a couple of\nsuch videos each week.",

    "Below each lecture, you see a\nlink to the textbook, to a", 
    "relevant portion of\nthe textbook.",

    "into each of the handouts.", 
    "Now, in the previous video\nsnippet, I talked about a",
