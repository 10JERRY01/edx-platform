    "SPEAKER 1: Now that we have a more detailed model of the op", 
    "amp that can deflect the dynamics, the temporal", 
    "dynamics of the op amp, I'd like to consider the following", 
    "circuit, and build upon this to understand the dynamics of", 
    "the op amp.", 
    "So what I'd like to do is apply both negative and", 
    "positive feedback within a circuit, and then see how the", 
    "two play against each other.", 
    "Okay, so here's what I'd like to do.", 
    "So I'd like to apply some positive", 
    "feedback, and no inputs.", 
    "I want to ground both my inputs.", 
    "I want to ground the negative input as well, like so, and", 
    "apply negative feedback at the same time.", 
    "So this is V0.", 
    "Let me call this R2, R1, R4, R3.", 
    "Notice that the inputs are grounded, so that left to", 
    "itself, if everything worked out perfectly, no noise in the", 
    "system, the output V0 should simply stay at zero, and", 
    "nothing bad should happen to the circuit.", 
    "But notice that I have connected positive feedback,", 
    "and feeding a portion of the output to the positive", 
    "terminal, and a portion of the output to", 
    "the negative terminal.", 
    "And then I'm going to model this, using my dynamic model", 
    "of the op amp, and see what happens to the output if I", 
    "perturb the output ever so slightly.", 
    "So let me write this down, and then you can go ahead and do", 
    "the analysis.", 
    "So what I'll do, as I said earlier, I would like to take", 
    "the circuit with negative and positive feedback, and apply a", 
    "perturbation.", 
    "The way it would have modeled this perturbation that I've", 
    "shown you here is, I'm going to say that at time t equal to", 
    "zero, I'm going to assume some slightly positive voltage.", 
    "So in my circuit, at time t equal to zero, I'm going to", 
    "assume that the V0 of zero is going to be some K. Just some", 
    "small voltage.", 
    "This could happen, for example, if V0 has a little", 
    "bit of noise on it.", 
    "So you notice that V0 here--", 
    "V star here, rather--", 
    "so V star has a small amount of noise on V star then the", 
    "output, which is A times V star is going to also have A", 
    "times V star on it, and that is what I'm modeling here.", 
    "I'm going to model that at time t equal to zero, V0 known", 
    "of zero is some K, and it's not zero.", 
    "And I'd like to see what happens to this K volts that", 
    "is at the output at time t equals zero, and see how that", 
    "changes over time.", 
    "So we will develop an equation representing the", 
    "time behavior of V0.", 
    "So before I begin to do that, let me just complete the", 
    "circuit model, because that is what we will use in building", 
    "up our time behavior.", 
    "And from there, we are going to get some insight into both", 
    "positive and negative feedback.", 
    "All right, so let me start with providing the positive", 
    "feedback connection.", 
    "Notice that the stuff inside the green here is the op amp", 
    "model and this model, recall, have a V plus, minus, a V", 
    "minus here.", 
    "Inside the op amp model I've a resistance and a capacitance.", 
    "And then I have a V star across the capacitor.", 
    "And my output is a dependent voltage source, AV star And", 
    "then here is my output plus, minus with respect to ground,", 
    "and that is my V0 for my op amp circuit.", 
    "Let me connect my feedback connection, let's start with a", 
    "positive feedback connection.", 
    "And so here, I have my positive feedback connection,", 
    "that is R2.", 
    "And then, I have my R2 that goes, R1 that goes to ground.", 
    "I have my negative feedback connection", 
    "here, and that is R4.", 
    "And I have my R3 going to ground.", 
    "Okay, let me just check to make sure I", 
    "have not missed anything.", 
    "Yup, that is the right circuit.", 
    "Also notice that if the output is V0, then V star is going to", 
    "be V0 divided by A. So the relationship between V star", 
    "and V0 is both of them are related by the gain A.", 
    "So let's move on, and see what we come up with as we analyze", 
    "the details of the op amp with this dynamic model in place."
