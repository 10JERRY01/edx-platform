    "SPEAKER: OK.", 
    "Hope you had a chance to try it out for yourself and", 
    "convince yourself how easy the impedance model is, even for a", 
    "more complicated second-order system where you have to find", 
    "out the complex amplitude.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do it for you.", 
    "It's pretty straightforward.", 
    "We're going to start by drawing the impedance model of", 
    "the circuit.", 
    "Although, as I mentioned earlier, if you're", 
    "comfortable, you can directly skip that step and write it", 
    "directly from the regular circuit model.", 
    "So let me just go ahead and do it, write the impedance model", 
    "of the circuit.", 
    "So I have zL which is given by sL And then I have the", 
    "capacitor, zC given by 1 by sC Then I have the resistor, R.", 
    "So Zr equals R. And I am done.", 
    "OK, this is Vi.", 
    "I And Vr is the complex amplitude for my resistor.", 
    "And Ir is the complex amplitude of the current.", 
    "So again, just to be absolutely clear, once I have", 
    "the Vr, I know for an input of the form Vi cosine omega t, my", 
    "output is going to be of the form absolute--", 
    "my magnitude of Vr cosine omega t, plus angle of Vr.", 
    "So we skip this final step and stop at finding the complex", 
    "amplitude, Vr.", 
    "So let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So Vr is, by a straightforward application of the", 
    "voltage-divided relationship, going to", 
    "look like the following.", 
    "So let's find out the current through the circuit.", 
    "So the current through the circuit is simply going to be", 
    "Vi divided by the sum of the impedances, zL", 
    "plus zC plus zR.", 
    "That's the current.", 
    "So Vi divided by the sum of the impedances is the current", 
    "Lr And then I simply multiply that by Zr.", 
    "And that gives me--", 
    "let me use the small r here, Zr.", 
    "And that gives me the voltage across the resistor.", 
    "So continuing on, so Vr, if by replace the impedances, Z's,", 
    "with their respective values, so I get Vr equals Vi times R,", 
    "divided by sL for the conductor impedance, divide by", 
    "1 by sC for the capacitor impedance,", 
    "plus R for the resistor.", 
    "Again, though, this is a such extraordinarily simple stuff.", 
    "I mean, can you believe that I have written down Vr, the", 
    "complex amplitude, in pretty much one single step.", 
    "And remember, s equals j omega here.", 
    "OK, one single step and I am done.", 
    "OK, let me just futz around a little bit and express it in a", 
    "slightly different form, to see if you would recognize", 
    "something here.", 
    "Why don't I go ahead and multiply both numerator and", 
    "denominator by s.", 
    "And then let me also divide the numerator and denominator", 
    "by L. So I'm going to multiply the numerator and denominator", 
    "by s divided by L. So what do I get?", 
    "So I get ViR times s divided by L.", 
    "And so here, I have s times s, divided by L times", 
    "L, gives me s squared.", 
    "And then I get s divided by L, here, gives me", 
    "1 divided by LC.", 
    "And then I multiply it by s divided by L, what do I get?", 
    "I get R divided by L times s.", 
    "OK, what does this remind you of?", 
    "What does this remind you of here?", 
    "I did this on purpose.", 
    "You saw this as s squared plus RLs, plus 1 by LC.", 
    "Remember this?", 
    "Remember characteristic equation for the second-order", 
    "series RLC circuit?", 
    "OK, right there, you have it.", 
    "I have the characteristic equation right here, using the", 
    "impedance method.", 
    "So now I can even get time-domain behavior, can get", 
    "time-domain behavior, as well.", 
    "So I can then go ahead and substitute s equals j omega,", 
    "and clean things up a little bit.", 
    "So I get Vr equals Vi R divided by L, times j omega.", 
    "And then I get s squared for j omega", 
    "becomes minus omega squared.", 
    "And then I get R divided by L j omega.", 
    "And then I get 1 by LC as before.", 
    "So what we're going to do is, you're going to study this and", 
    "other functions in much more detail in the next sequence.", 
    "But for now, I would just like to dwell on what you've", 
    "learned so far for a little while longer", 
    "in the current sequence.", 
    "Let me just write that down.", 
    "So let's go ahead and look at some analysis of what we've", 
    "seen so far."
