    "SPEAKER 1: So let&#39;s take a look\nat the next step to see", 
    "what happens once I introduce\nnoise into the system.", 
    "OK, so here&#39;s the same system.", 
    "I have the same sender, I\nhave the same receiver,", 
    "connected by a wire.", 
    "And this case, what I&#39;m going\nto do is inject some noise", 
    "into the system and\nsee what happens.", 
    "So I inject some noise\ninto the system.", 
    "So let me call the\nnoise signal VN.", 
    "And I am going to inject that\ninto the system here.", 
    "And so let&#39;s assume that my\nnoise signal VN is on the", 
    "order of 0.2 volts.", 
    "So that the voltage on the wire\nhere is going to have", 
    "this noise signal\nadded on to it.", 
    "The VN equals 0.2 volts.", 
    "So think of the noise signal as\nmuch noise in the following", 
    "way and it&#39;s about 0.2 volts.", 
    "OK, so if a noise signal who&#39;s\npeak to peak value is on the", 
    "order of 0.2 volts, and so let&#39;s\nunderstand what happens", 
    "to my real ago when noise is", 
    "superimposed on the real signal.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with\na clean input.", 
    "So VS is my normally input.", 
    "Same as before, it&#39;s a 0, 1, 0\nsequence by sending 0 volts", 
    "for some time, 5 volts, and\nthen 0 volts again.", 
    "Now in this case, if everything\nwas ideal, the", 
    "receiver would have received\nthat VR, the same 0, 5 volts,", 
    "0 volts at the receiver.", 
    "And notice that this is at 5\nvolts and this is at 0 volts.", 
    "Similarly, 5 volts here and\nsimilarly, 0 volts here.", 
    "So everything would&#39;ve been fine\nif there was no noise.", 
    "But in this case, I&#39;m going to\ninject my 0.2 volts of noise", 
    "in the signal.", 
    "So what happens at\nthe receiver?", 
    "So at the receiver, the 0.2\nvolts of noise is going to", 
    "superimpose on the real signal\nand I&#39;m going to get something", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "So has that done anything\nfor us here?", 
    "I imposed my noise single on\ntop of the real single, but", 
    "look what&#39;s happened here.", 
    "Remember my convention.", 
    "My convention was that any\nsignal above 2.5 volts, I was", 
    "going to interpret that as a\nlogical 1 and any signal below", 
    "the 2.5 volts, I was going to\ninterpret that as a logical 0.", 
    "So notice the beauty of this.", 
    "The beauty of this is that even\nthough I&#39;ve superimposed", 
    "a noise on my signal, even with\nthe noise I get a 0 here", 
    "because even with the noise\nmy signal is below 0.", 
    "And out here, even with the\nnoise I&#39;m above 2.5.", 
    "And similarly here,\nI&#39;m below 2.5.", 
    "And so my receiver still gets\nthe 0, 1, 0 signal at the end.", 
    "So this is absolutely amazing.", 
    "One of things you will see in\nthis circuits and electronics", 
    "course is you will see some\nspectacular discoveries or", 
    "some spectacular ideas\nthat really were", 
    "world changing ideas.", 
    "I think of these as\ngreat aha moments.", 
    "And this is one of those big aha\nmoments, where the simple", 
    "idea, whereby restricting values\nto two and by having", 
    "enough of a margin here, so I\nhad enough a margin for error.", 
    "And because I had a margin\nfor error, even though I", 
    "introduced some noise in the\nsystem, the margin for error", 
    "was such that I was able to\nreceive the correct signal.", 
    "And this is absolutely\nspectacular.", 
    "This allows us to build systems\nand make them work in", 
    "noisy environments.", 
    "And this was one of the big\nbreakthroughs of all time.", 
    "And if you were to list some of\nthe greatest inventions or", 
    "the greatest breakthroughs in\nthe world that really changed", 
    "the way we lived, the whole move\nto the digital system, or", 
    "the use of the digital system\nto build potentially", 
    "horrendously complicated systems\nstill make them work", 
    "was certainly one of those\nbig inventions.", 
    "So this is your aha moment\nwhere you see how the", 
    "transition from the analog\ndomain to the digital domain", 
    "gives you some really, really\nuseful features.", 
    "Where even in noisy\nenvironments, which is pretty", 
    "much all environments, most of\nour environments are noisy", 
    "environments, very, very rarely\ndo you find a pristine", 
    "clear environment where\npurely analog", 
    "signals will simply work.", 
    "There&#39;s noise everywhere.", 
    "Noise is always adding on to\nsignals and you simply have to", 
    "get used to processing in\nthe presence of noise.", 
    "And the digital abstraction,\nthis approach of the", 
    "discretizing values really\nenabled us to still build", 
    "functioning systems in the\npresence of noise, which is", 
    "pretty much everywhere\nin the world.", 
    "So back to a digital system, to\nreally quickly summarize.", 
    "A digital system gives us much\nbetter noise immunity.", 
    "And that gives me margin\nfor error.", 
    "And that&#39;s called\nnoise margin.", 
    "So for a 1, when I&#39;m sending a\n1, what is my noise margin?", 
    "If my sender sends a 5 volts\nfor a 1, then I have from 5", 
    "volts to 2.5 volts as\nmy noise margin.", 
    "So this means that I have 2.5\nvolts of noise margin.", 
    "And so noise that is up to 2.5\nvolts, even if noise up to 2.5", 
    "adds up, I can still\nfunction correctly.", 
    "Similarly, for the 0, I have for\n0 volts here, which is a 0", 
    "single value, I have another\nset of noise margins from 0", 
    "volts to 2.5 volts.", 
    "And that gives me and other\nnoise margin, which I call the", 
    "0 noise margin of 2.5 volts.", 
    "So notice that this kind of\nconstruction gave me a 1 noise", 
    "margin of 2.5 volts and a 0\nnoise margin of 2.5 volts.", 
    "OK, so before we begin the next\npiece of information, let", 
    "me very quickly summarize where\nwe are so far and give", 
    "you the big picture.", 
    "So this is the world we live\nin, this is a nature.", 
    "And within that, we have\nconstructed the EECS", 
    "playground for ourselves\nby lumping matter.", 
    "And within this playground,\nrecall the good things happen,", 
    "algebraic expressions apply.", 
    "And further, we have a smaller\nregion within the playground", 
    "that we created for ourselves\nwhere circuits are linear.", 
    "And within that, some very\npowerful techniques like", 
    "superposition and so on apply.", 
    "What we&#39;ve done today is created\nfor ourselves another", 
    "region of the playground.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to it Disneyland,\noh, I&#39;m sorry,", 
    "digital land.", 
    "So in digital land what I&#39;ve\ndone is I have discretized", 
    "values or I have\nlumped values.", 
    "And just spectacularly good\nand fun things happen.", 
    "In this land, I&#39;m going to come\nin and say, hey, look, if", 
    "you want to come into digital\nland, here you only have to", 
    "talk 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s.", 
    "You cannot bring in 1.66&#39;s,\nyou cannot bring in funny", 
    "values, you have to talk\nin 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s.", 
    "So can we all promise that we\nwill talk with just two", 
    "values, 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s.", 
    "And because of that,\nwe will get", 
    "extraordinary noise immunity.", 
    "And given that the world is\nfull of noise, any circuit", 
    "anywhere has a lot of noise,\nin the digital world, I can", 
    "now build circuits containing\nbillions and even tens or", 
    "hundreds of billions of elements\nand expect hundreds", 
    "of billions of elements to\nwork together correctly", 
    "because they are immune\nto noise.", 
    "And this has been one of the\ngreat things that has fueled", 
    "our entire multiple generations\nin the past", 
    "several decades and has\nenabled us to build", 
    "extraordinary systems that\nhave been extraordinarily", 
    "helpful to humanity.", 
    "OK, so within that EECS\nplayground, we have the linear", 
    "circuit area, we have\nthe digital land.", 
    "Notice that digital circuits\ntend to be nonlinear, which is", 
    "why I have drawn them", 
    "separately from linear circuits.", 
    "But we will look at a trick\nlater on in this course", 
    "whereby being a little bit\nclever I can still analyze", 
    "digital circuits using linear\ntechniques in some regions of", 
    "digital circuit operation.",
