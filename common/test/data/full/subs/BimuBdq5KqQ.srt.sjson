    "PROFESSOR: So far in 6.002,\nyou&#39;ve seen how by making some", 
    "simplifications of Maxwell&#39;s\nequations, we&#39;ve ended up with", 
    "very simple algebraic\nlaws that can be", 
    "used to analyze circuits.", 
    "And in this little playground\nof ours,", 
    "really good things happen.", 
    "This is our EECS playground,\nwhere by making some", 
    "simplifications, we&#39;ve been able\nto really come up with", 
    "very simple techniques for\nanalyzing circuits.", 
    "So today, as we build up our\narsenal of techniques for", 
    "analyzing circuits, we&#39;ll look\nat a further simplification.", 
    "We&#39;re going to look at a part\nof this playground in which", 
    "linear circuits reside.", 
    "These kinds of circuits allow\nus to use some even more", 
    "powerful techniques\nto analyze them.", 
    "These new techniques that you\nwill learn today include", 
    "superposition, Thevenin\nand Norton.", 
    "It&#39;s pretty amazing to think\nof these techniques as the", 
    "bazookas of EECS.", 
    "OK, let me start with a quick\nreview as is my usual practice", 
    "of what we&#39;ve seen so far.", 
    "So the circuit analysis method\nyou&#39;ve seen so far include,", 
    "first of all, the\nKVL, KCL method.", 
    "In this method, the KVL, KCL,\nand the element rules are used", 
    "to analyze circuits.", 
    "The KVL method, as you&#39;ve seen\nbefore, is one where you take", 
    "the various voltages in a loop\nin a circuit and they should", 
    "all sum to zero.", 
    "Similarly, the currents\nat any given node,", 
    "must also sum to zero.", 
    "That&#39;s KCL.", 
    "And so you apply these KVL,\nKCL and element rules to", 
    "circuits, and then\ngo solve them.", 
    "But we did see that they ended\nup with a very large number of", 
    "equations that were quite\nmessy to resolve.", 
    "The second technique that we\nlooked at last week included", 
    "circuit decomposition rules,\nwhere you applied some of", 
    "these rules to compose resistors\nand other elements,", 
    "and solved circuits that way.", 
    "And then, we looked at the node\nmethod, where you chose a", 
    "ground in a circuit.", 
    "And then you applied KCL at\neach of the nodes, the", 
    "reference to the ground node.", 
    "And what was interesting is that\nthe KVL was implicit in", 
    "the pattern that you used in\nthe node method, where the", 
    "pattern was the ei minus ej,\ndivided by the resistance of a", 
    "given [UNINTELLIGIBLE].", 
    "And this was a pattern that you\nreally borrowed from KVL,", 
    "and this was implicitly used\nin the node method.", 
    "The node method, of course, is\nthe workhorse of 6.002 and can", 
    "be applied to all kinds\nof circuits.", 
    "It really applies in the entire\nplayground of ours.", 
    "So when in doubt, simply\ngo ahead and", 
    "apply the node method.", 
    "OK, as I promised, we&#39;ll now\nlook at the smaller region of", 
    "the playground, and see if some\ninteresting things happen", 
    "in that playground.", 
    "So to give you a quick review,\nlet me start by looking at", 
    "some basic properties\nof linear circuits.", 
    "Following that, I will look at\nthe superposition tool kit for", 
    "your arsenal of techniques\nto analyze circuits.", 
    "And then I will talk about\nthe Thevenin method.", 
    "And finally, I&#39;ll talk about\nthe Norton method.", 
    "OK, so let&#39;s get started with\nlinear circuits and see what", 
    "linearity means.", 
    "So I want to do an example using\nthe following little", 
    "circuit, in which I have\na voltage source", 
    "and a current source.", 
    "And my goal here is to find the\nvoltage at this node e.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to pick a ground\nnode here and find the voltage", 
    "e referenced to this ground\nnode that I&#39;ve just", 
    "marked out for you.", 
    "So to analyze a circuit, you&#39;re\nsupposed to write down", 
    "the node equations.", 
    "And write down the mode\nequations for the node.", 
    "That&#39;s the only node for which\nwe have an unknown.", 
    "Recall that I have another node\nhere, but because that is", 
    "connected by a voltage source\nto ground, its voltage is", 
    "simply V.", 
    "OK, let&#39;s start by writing the\nnode equations for the node", 
    "with unknown voltage e.", 
    "So let&#39;s start by looking at the\ncurrent that goes from the", 
    "node with voltage\ne to the left.", 
    "And so I take e minus\nV divided by R1.", 
    "That is the current headed in\nthe direction from e to v.", 
    "And then I add the current that\nis going down this edge.", 
    "That is just simply\ne divided by R2.", 
    "And then I take the\ncurrent that is", 
    "headed in this direction.", 
    "And that is simply minus I.\nAccording to the KCL rule,", 
    "they all sum up to 0.", 
    "So the first thing you will\nnotice as you write the node", 
    "equation right away is that this\nequation here shows you", 
    "that it is linear in the various\nvoltages and currents", 
    "e, V, and I. In other words, you\ndon&#39;t have terms, no terms", 
    "that are eV, or V squared,\nor VI, and so on.", 
    "So this circuit here is", 
    "characterized by the node equation.", 
    "And notice that it is linear\nin the e, V, and I terms.", 
    "OK, let&#39;s go ahead and look at\nthis in some more detail.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to simplify the\nequation a little bit more to", 
    "really get a much clearer sense\nof the linearity here.", 
    "So I&#39;ve written down\nthe node equation.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to simplify by\nrearranging some of the terms", 
    "in the equation.", 
    "So let me collect the various\ncoefficients.", 
    "So let me write down e on this\nside, and look at and collect", 
    "all the terms that multiply e.", 
    "So I see a 1 by R1 term here.", 
    "Let me write that down.", 
    "I see a 1 by R2 term.", 
    "And so e is my unknown.", 
    "Let we collect the knowns\non the right-hand side.", 
    "So one of the knowns is I.\nSo let me move it to the", 
    "right-hand side and\nput that there.", 
    "The other known is this one\nhere, V divided by R1.", 
    "I&#39;m going to take it to\nthe right-hand side.", 
    "It becomes plus V\ndivided by R1.", 
    "So let me introduce a little\nbit of nomenclature here.", 
    "So notice I&#39;ve rearranged the\nterms. And I get some", 
    "coefficients multiplying e,\nand that is a sum of the", 
    "sources, V and I, where\nV has been scaled by", 
    "1 divided by R1.", 
    "So when you look at these terms,\nlet&#39;s understand a", 
    "couple of things.", 
    "Let&#39;s understand a couple\nof things right away.", 
    "So if you look at the\ncoefficient of the unknown e,", 
    "in general when you have a much\nlarger circuit, it is not", 
    "a single value, but rather\nit is a matrix of values.", 
    "And it&#39;s just good to know these\nterms. It&#39;s called a", 
    "conductance matrix.", 
    "Similarly, it&#39;s usually\ngiven the symbol G.", 
    "Similarly, the node voltages\nbecomes a column vector of", 
    "node voltages, and it&#39;s\ngiven the label e.", 
    "And then, on the right-hand\nside, you have the linear sum", 
    "of sources, and that is given\nthe term S. And so you get the", 
    "form G times e equals S, where\nG is a matrix usually, e is a", 
    "column vector.", 
    "And similarly, the sum of\nsources ends up being a column", 
    "vector as well.", 
    "So with that bit of cultural\nbackground in terms of what", 
    "these things are called\nin general, let me", 
    "simplify them further.", 
    "And what I get now is--", 
    "let&#39;s try to have e on the\nleft-hand side all by itself,", 
    "and divide both sides by\nthe coefficient of e.", 
    "And this guy here, if I simplify\nit, becomes R1 R2", 
    "divided by R2 plus R1.", 
    "So when I multiply out both\nsides by that, what I end up", 
    "getting is I have a V here,\nand I have the I here.", 
    "So what is the coefficient\nof V?", 
    "So I multiply both\nsides by R1 R2.", 
    "And so R1 and R1 cancel out.", 
    "So I end up with\nR2 at the top.", 
    "And I get R1 plus\nR2 down here.", 
    "Similarly, so what do you\nthink we get for I here?", 
    "For I, I end up with\nR1 R2 divided by R1", 
    "plus R2 down here.", 
    "So notice that the linearity\nbecomes much more obvious at", 
    "this point where my unknown e\nis some constant coefficient", 
    "times the voltage v and some\nconstant coefficient times the", 
    "current I.", 
    "In other words, e is of the\nfollowing form. e is some", 
    "constant coefficient times my\nfirst source, some constant", 
    "coefficient times\nV2, and so on.", 
    "Plus some other coefficient\ntimes I1, some other", 
    "coefficient times\nI2, and so on.", 
    "So if you look at this form\nhere, notice that this is", 
    "linear in the sources\nVIs and IIs.",
