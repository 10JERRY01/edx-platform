    "SPEAKER: So we now have found the total solution.", 
    "So let me stare at that for a little while longer and see if", 
    "we can make some sense out of it and try to get some insight", 
    "into what is really going on here.", 
    "So the total solution that we obtained was v was given by Vi", 
    "divided by 1 plus square root of omega squared R squared C", 
    "squared times cosine omega t plus phi minus a e raised to", 
    "minus t over RC.", 
    "And a was minus Vi square root of 1 plus omega squared R", 
    "squared C squared cosine phi and e raised to minus t over", 
    "RC, where phi was given by 10 inverse of minus omega RC.", 
    "So I have this.", 
    "And this was my total solution.", 
    "So if you really, really wanted the total solution,", 
    "here it is.", 
    "So there is a [UNINTELLIGIBLE] exponential component.", 
    "And then that is a sinusoidal component.", 
    "So one thing to notice, so if I plot this, if I plot this,", 
    "what would it look like?", 
    "So when t is 0, this whole thing goes to 0.", 
    "And if I plot this as a function of time, it's going", 
    "to look something like this.", 
    "This is time.", 
    "This is 0.", 
    "And this is v. It's going to look something like this.", 
    "So notice that there is a exponential part.", 
    "There is a part that's rising up.", 
    "And then after that things settle down.", 
    "And I just get this sinusoid.", 
    "So this initial part, the e raised to minus t over RC", 
    "governs this initial part.", 
    "And then after that, it is this component that pretty", 
    "much covers this remaining sinusoid here.", 
    "Now in most of these circuit-- so let's say, for example, I'm", 
    "playing music through a stereo system.", 
    "There I don't particularly care how the system sounds", 
    "when I just switch it on.", 
    "In fact, when you just switch it on it sounds pretty crappy.", 
    "You really care about, once it settles down, how music sounds", 
    "in it over the longer term.", 
    "So you care about the steady state solution.", 
    "You care about how things look after all the", 
    "transients have died out.", 
    "So let me just write down that and see if", 
    "that can help us somehow.", 
    "So we are usually interested in the particular solution for", 
    "sinusoids after the transients have died out.", 
    "OK So in this particular situation we really care about", 
    "what happens in the steady state.", 
    "So we are usually interested only in the particular", 
    "solution for sinusoids and not particularly interested in the", 
    "homogeneous solution.", 
    "So the homogeneous solution is what governs the transients.", 
    "And so, therefore, this particular solution is of", 
    "interest. And that is after the transients", 
    "have all died out.", 
    "And in here, this is a transient.", 
    "So once d is large, then the e raised to minus t over RC, the", 
    "transient component, goes to 0.", 
    "And then all that I'm left with is this,", 
    "the particular solution.", 
    "This is the homogeneous solution, v edge.", 
    "And the v edge goes to 0, as the transients die out because", 
    "e raised to minus t over RC goes to 0.", 
    "And what I'm left with is a particular solution.", 
    "So, in general, I really care about the particular solution.", 
    "And I don't care a whole lot about what happens at the", 
    "transient stage when things are just ramping up.", 
    "So this solution is described as the", 
    "sinusoidal steady state.", 
    "[? Or the ?] solution in the steady state when the", 
    "transients have died out is described as the sinusoidal", 
    "steady state.", 
    "Also recall that the components of interest within", 
    "the particular solution vp--", 
    "so if you notice this piece here and the phase here, both", 
    "of them came directly from vp over here.", 
    "So once I found vp, I obtained both of them directly from", 
    "that vp over there.", 
    "So let's proceed a little further along with the", 
    "realization that all I really care about is", 
    "the particular solution.", 
    "And I don't really care about the homogeneous solution", 
    "because I'm perfectly willing to wait for the", 
    "transients to die out.", 
    "And it's a long-term solution that I care about.", 
    "An example I gave was with music.", 
    "I really don't care about how the system sounds when it's", 
    "just switched or when the music just starts.", 
    "It is how does it sound after a few seconds.", 
    "And that is what matters.", 
    "So the sinusoidal steady state is what I really care about.", 
    "And I call it SSS.", 
    "And in the steady state, notice that vp says it all.", 
    "vp was a complex amplitude.", 
    "And that says it all.", 
    "So let me go ahead and write that down.", 
    "So all information about the sinusoidal steady state is", 
    "contained in the complex amplitude vp.", 
    "And recall that vp for our little problem was Vi divided", 
    "by 1 plus j omega RC.", 
    "So this was the complex amplitude that multiplied e", 
    "raised to j omega t, which was my sneaky solution.", 
    "So if this is all that's of importance, if VP is all that", 
    "matters, and the reason is that given VP, I can very", 
    "quickly find out the output, where the output was simply", 
    "the magnitude of vp times cosine omega t plus", 
    "the angle of vp.", 
    "So I could find the real input.", 
    "So this was my real input directly from the complex", 
    "amplitude vp.", 
    "So what that meant was that two of the steps that I", 
    "pursued were an utter waste of time.", 
    "In other words, in solving the differential equation, steps", 
    "three and four were a waste of time.", 
    "Recall step three was where I figured out", 
    "the homogeneous response.", 
    "And step four was where I figured", 
    "out the total response.", 
    "I didn't care about the homogeneous response.", 
    "I didn't care about the total response.", 
    "I just cared about the particular response because", 
    "the particular response was the steady state solution to", 
    "the sinusoid.", 
    "So that is pretty cool.", 
    "This means that I can neglect steps three and four and", 
    "simply stop at step two.", 
    "Step one was write the differential equation.", 
    "And step two was go ahead and figure out the complex", 
    "amplitude for the sneaky input.", 
    "So let me just go and mess around with this equation here", 
    "a little bit and write this as vp--", 
    "take a ratio, vp divided by Vi is 1 plus j omega RC.", 
    "And I can write that down in phase magnitude form as 1", 
    "divided by square root of 1 plus omega squared R squared C", 
    "squared times e raised to j phi.", 
    "I just simply replaced--", 
    "written that in its phase magnitude form, where phi is", 
    "simply tan inverse of minus omega RC.", 
    "So here I have it.", 
    "Let me summarize what we've seen so far.", 
    "So here the important components are the magnitude,", 
    "so the magnitude vp over Vi.", 
    "And that is 1 divided by square root of 1 plus omega", 
    "squared R squared C squared.", 
    "And then the phrase is also important.", 
    "The phase the angle of vp over Vi.", 
    "And that was minus tan inverse of omega RC.", 
    "So these were the two important quantities.", 
    "And notice that I obtained them directly from the complex", 
    "amplitude vp.", 
    "And the reason these two were the important quantities is", 
    "that these relate to the", 
    "magnitude gain of the response.", 
    "That is, by what factor was the output", 
    "greater than the input.", 
    "And phase by what amount was the phase at the output", 
    "different from the phase at the input.", 
    "So this so much so for the math.", 
    "And this tells us how to obtain the steady", 
    "[UNINTELLIGIBLE] points.", 
    "And before I go and summarize things for us, I would like to", 
    "very quickly show you the paths we've taken and recap,", 
    "so you can get a visual picture of the various", 
    "processes that we've undertaken here."
