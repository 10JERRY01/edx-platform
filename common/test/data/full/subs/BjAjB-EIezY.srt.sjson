    "SPEAKER: OK, let&#39;s\nkeep moving.", 
    "So I&#39;ve just summarized what\nI&#39;ve done so far here, where", 
    "iD is now approximately equal.", 
    "I have to say approximately\nequal because I had other", 
    "terms which were higher order\nterms. And I have neglected", 
    "all of those terms. Because I&#39;ve\nneglected all of those", 
    "terms because delta VD is small,\nI&#39;m going to be left", 
    "with iD being approximately\nequal to the term on the", 
    "right-hand side here.", 
    "So let&#39;s stare at\nthis expression,", 
    "this equation here.", 
    "What do you see that is\ninteresting about it?", 
    "First of all, notice the first\nhalf, f of capital VD.", 
    "So VD is the DC value.", 
    "It&#39;s a fixed DC value.", 
    "It&#39;s not changing with time.", 
    "So right there you notice that\nit is a constant with respect", 
    "to delta VD.", 
    "So delta VD can change all\nat once, but capital V", 
    "capital D is fixed.", 
    "So this first term\nis a constant.", 
    "So that&#39;s the first\nthing you observe.", 
    "What&#39;s the second thing\nyou observe?", 
    "The second thing to observe is,\nif you look at this term", 
    "here, and that term is\nalso constant with", 
    "respect to delta VD.", 
    "And in fact, that term is the\nslope of the function f of VD", 
    "at the point VD, ID.", 
    "OK, so this piece here is the\nslope of the function f of VD", 
    "at the point capital V capital\nD comma capital I capital D.", 
    "So the first part is the\nslope of the function.", 
    "And then, that multiplies\nthe small change.", 
    "So what do I have?", 
    "So I have ID being equal\nto a constant.", 
    "Plus constant times delta VD.", 
    "So ID is simply equal\nto a constant plus a", 
    "constant times delta VD.", 
    "So the slope here is independent\nof delta VD.", 
    "So what can I do next?", 
    "So what I can do next is because\nID is equal to a", 
    "constant, I can express\nmy ID as follows.", 
    "What I can say is that my ID\ncomprises two components.", 
    "My ID has some component\ncapitalized I, capital D, a DC", 
    "component, and it has some time\nvarying component that I", 
    "call delta ID.", 
    "And I&#39;m getting that because on\nthe right-hand side, I have", 
    "a constant term and I have a\nconstant plus delta VD, which", 
    "is a term related to delta VD.", 
    "And delta VD is--", 
    "in this case, I&#39;m picking it\nto be a time varying term.", 
    "And so therefore, on the\nleft-hand side, I&#39;m going to", 
    "get a constant term plus a time\nvarying term, a small", 
    "time varying term.", 
    "So I have an ID plus a delta ID\non the left-hand side, and", 
    "that will be equal to f of\nVD plus d of f of VD dVD", 
    "evaluated at VD equals capital\nVD times delta VD.", 
    "So I&#39;ve just copied the\nright-hand side from the top.", 
    "So let&#39;s say with this\nfor a second.", 
    "I&#39;m going to go back and refer\nto this equation a", 
    "dozen times from now.", 
    "So let me mark it with an x.", 
    "Let me mark it with an x, so I&#39;m\njust going to refer to it", 
    "as this little thing in x.", 
    "So I want you to stare at this\nx equation carefully.", 
    "What do you see here?", 
    "First of all, notice these\ntwo terms here.", 
    "So take a look at this ID term\nand take a look at this f of", 
    "VD term here.", 
    "Let me use a different color\njust to make it stand out a", 
    "little bit better.", 
    "So look at ID and look\nat this piece here.", 
    "So notice right away that f of\nVD is simply the original", 
    "equation evaluated\nat the point VD.", 
    "What was the original\nequation?", 
    "The original equation was\nID equals f of some VD.", 
    "That was the original equation\nfor my light emitting", 
    "[UNINTELLIGIBLE].", 
    "So what that is saying is that\nthe first constant term is", 
    "simply the same function\nevaluated at VD.", 
    "And so that is equal to ID.", 
    "So ID is simply the function\nevaluated at capital VD.", 
    "No surprises.", 
    "No real surprises there.", 
    "Then, let me take the second\npart, take delta ID.", 
    "So delta is given by the\nsecond piece here.", 
    "That delta ID is simply\nsome constant.", 
    "This was a constant.", 
    "Some constant times delta VD.", 
    "So let me just separate out\nthose parts and write them out", 
    "as two pieces.", 
    "And what I can do now is, since\nthis is DC and this is", 
    "time varying, this is DC and\nthis is time varying by my", 
    "construction.", 
    "I want to tease them apart.", 
    "So if DC plus the time varying\npart of an equation relates to", 
    "a DC and time varying part on\nthe right-hand side, then you", 
    "can equate the DC and time\nvarying components.", 
    "So let me equate DC and time\nvarying components.", 
    "And the reason I can do that\nis when I have an equation,", 
    "that equation must be\ntrue for all time.", 
    "So as time changes and\nif I have a DC and", 
    "time varying part.", 
    "and if the time varying part\nkeeps changing, then because", 
    "the equation must be true for\nall time, then it must follow", 
    "that the DC parts must be equal\nand the time varying", 
    "parts must be equal.", 
    "Clearly, the DC but doesn&#39;t\nchange with time, and so as", 
    "that changes, it cannot\ninfluence the DC part.", 
    "So therefore the two DC\nparts must be equal.", 
    "So therefore, the DC parts\nhere, our ID, is", 
    "equal to f of VD.", 
    "So that is my DC part.", 
    "And then I have a time\nvarying part.", 
    "And the time varying part is\nID is equal to D f of VD by", 
    "dVD evaluated at VD equals\ncapital VD times delta VD.", 
    "And as I had mentioned before,\nthis part here is constant", 
    "with respect to delta VD.", 
    "So what have we here?", 
    "What we have here is on the\nleft-hand side, I have equated", 
    "DC parts of the equation.", 
    "And I call this my\noperating point.", 
    "That is the operating point.", 
    "And on the right-hand side,\nI&#39;ve equated my", 
    "time varying part.", 
    "I caught a bug here, it\nshould be a delta ID.", 
    "So delta ID is my time\nvarying part.", 
    "And that is equal to the\ntime varying part", 
    "of the above equation.", 
    "And within that time varying\npart, the part which is the", 
    "slope of the function\nis a constant with", 
    "respect to delta VD.", 
    "So let me just make a note of\nthat, which is that-- let me", 
    "pick a different color.", 
    "So this piece here, the blue\npiece, is the slope of the", 
    "function at capital VD, ID.", 
    "Is the slope of the function ID\nequals f of VD at the point", 
    "capital VD, capital ID.", 
    "So there you have it.", 
    "So I&#39;ve equated the DC and time\nvarying parts, and I&#39;ve", 
    "got two components to my--", 
    "my x equation is broken\nup into parts.",
