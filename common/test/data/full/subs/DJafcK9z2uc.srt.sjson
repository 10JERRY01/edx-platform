    "SPEAKER 1: So so far we looked\nat a MOSFET that behaves like", 
    "a switch and looked at\na very simplified", 
    "version of MOSFET behavior.", 
    "And we also saw how as I changed\nthe gate voltage--", 
    "the gate to source voltage of\nthe MOSFET-- and make it above", 
    "VT or below VT, I get the MOSFET\nbehaving like a switch", 
    "that&#39;s turned on or switch\nthat&#39;s turned off.", 
    "And we&#39;ll use that property by\nreplacing a switch with a", 
    "MOSFET and show you\nhow to build an", 
    "inverter with a MOSFET.", 
    "So here&#39;s my abstract date.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to show you what\nthe internals of a gate are", 
    "going to look like\nwith a MOSFET.", 
    "So here is my MOSFET.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to build\na gate as follows.", 
    "I connect the train--", 
    "I connect source of the\nMOSFET to ground.", 
    "Here&#39;s my train.", 
    "Here&#39;s my gate.", 
    "And I connect the gate\nto the input.", 
    "I apply resistor Rl.", 
    "And I get some output, which\ngoes to the output of my gate.", 
    "And this is Vs. And for fun\nlet&#39;s say Vs is five volts.", 
    "So here is my MOSFET connected\nto a resistor does it behave", 
    "like an inverter?", 
    "Pretty much as we said earlier\nwhen I had a switch in place", 
    "of a MOSFET it was\nan inverter.", 
    "When I put a physical MOSFET,\nthe behavior doesn&#39;t change.", 
    "Let me call this voltage V in.", 
    "And then let me call\nthis voltage V out.", 
    "Notice that V out is taken with\nrespect to ground which", 
    "is a source here.", 
    "And V in is also taken with\nrespect to ground.", 
    "So in this MOSFET, notice that\nV in is the same as VGS.", 
    "And similarly V out is the same\nas Vs by the way we&#39;ve", 
    "labeled the various\nnodes here.", 
    "So let&#39;s make some interesting\nobservations.", 
    "So first of all, notice that\nwhen I looked at the abstract", 
    "inverter, its inputs were A and\nB. And those were logical", 
    "values that took on\nvalue zero or one.", 
    "And notice when I looked inside\nthe inventor, I built a", 
    "circuit containing MOSFETs\nand resistors.", 
    "And there I show you values V in\nand V out where V in and V", 
    "out are voltage levels.", 
    "And notice the static discipline\nis what caused the", 
    "mapping between the voltage\nlevels and the logic values.", 
    "So here you will notice the\nextraordinary power of", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "The abstract inverter\nrepresentation completely his", 
    "all the internal details such\nas power supplies such as", 
    "ground, a resistor Rl and\nso on and so forth.", 
    "And you just dealt with\nones and zeroes and a", 
    "simple truths table.", 
    "So when we build these little\ncircuits, we can ignore all of", 
    "those when we design\nthe circuit.", 
    "However there&#39;s a\ncaution here.", 
    "Abstractions take us\njust this far.", 
    "When you actually build the\ncircuit, you actually have to", 
    "worry about electrical\nengineering and your current", 
    "pads and so on.", 
    "And really what is going on is\nwhen I connect a bunch of", 
    "gates together I&#39;m going to\nconnect all their grounds", 
    "together and all their supply\nvoltages together.", 
    "So for example, if I have an\ninverter talking to some kind", 
    "of a NAND gate, the inverter\nmight have a ground connection", 
    "and a ground connection\nfor the NAND gate.", 
    "Those two are going to be\nconnected in a board or in a", 
    "chip where I implement these.", 
    "Similarly when I have a power\nsupply connection, those are", 
    "connected together as well.", 
    "Just that my abstract\nrepresentation, my digital", 
    "representation, doesn&#39;t show\nall of these electrical", 
    "connections.", 
    "I really take a very\nsimplified view.", 
    "And that&#39;s really an\nincredible power of", 
    "abstraction.", 
    "What I&#39;d like to do next is\nfor my MOSFET inverter, I", 
    "would like to plot the values\nin the relationship between", 
    "the input and the output.", 
    "So here is my master inverter.", 
    "This was my gate.", 
    "This is my drain.", 
    "This is my source.", 
    "Notice that this was a VGS.", 
    "And this was a VDS.", 
    "So VDS is the same as V out.", 
    "And VGS is the same as V in.", 
    "V in is known voltage and with\nrespect to ground, which is", 
    "the same as VGS given the\nlabeling that I&#39;ve chosen.", 
    "And let me choose Vs\nequals five volts.", 
    "So one thing I&#39;d like to do is\nplot the relationship between", 
    "V out and V in, between\nthese two voltages.", 
    "So let me draw a pair of axes,\nV in versus V out.", 
    "And I can plot for different\nvalues of V in.", 
    "I could plot the corresponding\nvalues of V out.", 
    "This kind of a plot is called\na voltage transfer", 
    "characteristic, where I change\nthe input voltages and I want", 
    "to look at what the output\nvoltages look like.", 
    "So let me mark up on the V in\nversus V out transfer plot", 
    "some of the interesting\nvoltages.", 
    "I&#39;ve taken my ground to zero\nand my Vs is five volts.", 
    "So those are two interesting\npoints on both the V", 
    "in and V out axes.", 
    "And then remember that the\nMOSFET behaved like a switch", 
    "for various values all VGS.", 
    "Recall for VGS less than VT, I\ngot an open circuit between", 
    "the drain and source.", 
    "And for VGS greater than equal\nto VT, I got a short between", 
    "the drain and the source.", 
    "So let&#39;s keep that in mind.", 
    "And so let&#39;s take VT to be\none volt in terms of", 
    "drawing this plot.", 
    "So here is VT equals one volt.", 
    "Let me mark that point\non the x-axis.", 
    "I expect interesting behavior\nto happen at that point.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and plot\nV in versus V out.", 
    "So let&#39;s start with the\npoint where V in is", 
    "less than one volt.", 
    "So when V in is less than one\nvolt, then clearly VGS", 
    "is less than VT.", 
    "So VT is one volt.", 
    "And if VGS, which is--", 
    "let me just write that down to\nbe clear that VGS and V in are", 
    "the same thing here.", 
    "When VGS is less than\none volt, the MOSFET", 
    "is going to be off.", 
    "So when the MOSFET is off, then\nthe entire voltage, the", 
    "five volts, will fall\nacross the MOSFET.", 
    "Notice I have the resistant\ndivider Rl in series with an", 
    "open circuit.", 
    "So therefore all the\nfive volts ill fall", 
    "across the open circuit.", 
    "So this would be five volts.", 
    "So when V in is less\nthan one volt, the", 
    "output is five volts.", 
    "Now what happens when V in\nbecomes greater than one volt?", 
    "So when V in is greater\nthan one volt, VGS is", 
    "greater than VT.", 
    "And the MOSFET behaves\nlike a short circuit.", 
    "The MOSFET behaved like\na short circuit.", 
    "V zero falls to zero.", 
    "And then the output\ngoes down to zero.", 
    "So here VGS is less than VT.", 
    "And here VGS is greater\nthan or equal to VT.", 
    "So notice that when I cross the\nthreshold voltage, when V", 
    "in is greater than VT,\nmy MOSFET switches.", 
    "So this is where it switches.", 
    "And my gate switches from a one\nto a logical zero value.", 
    "So what I&#39;ve shown you here,\nthe V in versus the V out", 
    "characteristic is called a\ntransfer characteristic or a", 
    "voltage transfer characteristic\noff this little", 
    "inverter device.", 
    "So what you&#39;ve seen is something\nvery important.", 
    "We&#39;ve devised an inverter\nusing a MOSFET.", 
    "And we looked at the\nvoltage transfer", 
    "characteristic of the MOSFET.", 
    "And the next obvious question we\ncan ask ourselves is let&#39;s", 
    "use this voltage transfer\ncharacteristic.", 
    "And let&#39;s try to design\nan inverter out of it.", 
    "Let&#39;s try to design an inverter\nand see what we can", 
    "do in terms of making it\nsatisfy some static", 
    "discipline.", 
    "What kind of discipline\nwill it satisfy?", 
    "So here is this inverter that\nI&#39;ve just drawn for you.", 
    "And I just drew the transfer", 
    "characteristic for that inverter.", 
    "So let&#39;s try to understand\nthe following.", 
    "So here&#39;s a question that\nwe might ask ourselves.", 
    "So supposing I have a laptop.", 
    "Let&#39;s call that the T1000\nmodel laptop.", 
    "And let&#39;s call this company--", 
    "let&#39;s call that for kicks\nWintel for instance.", 
    "So what Wintel wants to do--", 
    "Wintel Corporation wants to\nbuilt a laptop, the T1000.", 
    "And it wants all the gates\ninside the laptop to satisfy a", 
    "given static discipline.", 
    "If all the gates in the laptop\nsatisfy a given static", 
    "discipline, then they can all\ntalk to each other with the", 
    "same language.", 
    "Suppose, for instance, that this\ncompany has decided on a", 
    "standard or a static discipline\nwith the following", 
    "voltage specials.", 
    "VUL is 0.5 volts and\nso on and so forth.", 
    "One of the common questions we\nwill ask ourselves in 6002X is", 
    "for the MOSFET inverter\nthat we are given.", 
    "Does it satisfy these\nvoltage specials?", 
    "And one thing that I find\nquite useful is to", 
    "draw it out like this.", 
    "I like to draw out issuing\na sender and issuing the", 
    "receiver and knowing that the\nsender needs to produce the", 
    "Vol, VOH voltages.", 
    "And the receiver needs to be\ninterpreting the VIH, VIL", 
    "thresholds.", 
    "So for instance I may have\nan inverter here.", 
    "And the outputs of the inverter\nmust satisfy the VOH,", 
    "Vol thresholds.", 
    "And the input here as an example\nmight be some kind of", 
    "an end gate.", 
    "And the NAND gate must interpret\nthe inputs according", 
    "to VIH and VIL thresholds.", 
    "So in this particular\nsituation,", 
    "my VOH is 4.5 volts.", 
    "My Vol is 0.5 volts.", 
    "And then I have 4.1 volt for\nVIH and 0.9 volts for VIR.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at what\nthe system will do for the", 
    "inverter that we&#39;ve built then\nsee if it really satisfies the", 
    "static discipline.",
