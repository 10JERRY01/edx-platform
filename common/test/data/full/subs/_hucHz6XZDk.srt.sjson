    "Finally, let me look at the critically damped case where", 
    "alpha equals omega naught or, equivalently, Q equals half.", 
    "Same circuits, input sinusoid for the frequency domain", 
    "analysis and unit step for the time domain analysis.", 
    "So in the case of my frequency domain analysis, let me first", 
    "draw out clearly, at the very low and very high frequencies,", 
    "the circuit behaves similarly.", 
    "So this would be the low-Q case.", 
    "And this would be the high-Q case.", 
    "Well, you might imagine what happens when you", 
    "get critical damping.", 
    "For critical damping, it's neither high nor low.", 
    "And it will look something like loop.", 
    "And that is how it will look.", 
    "OK, this is critical damping.", 
    "So not too surprising, it's somewhere between the low-Q", 
    "and the high-Q circuit.", 
    "Next, let's look at the time domain behavior of the same", 
    "circuit and for the step input.", 
    "And in this case, as before, it will eventually settle out", 
    "to a one and, for low-Q, at a very slowly rising waveform.", 
    "And then, for a high-Q, recall I had this ringy behavior.", 
    "OK, this was high-Q.", 
    "So not surprisingly, we can expect something between those", 
    "two for critical damping.", 
    "Then, not surprisingly, what I get is", 
    "something like this, OK?", 
    "That's a behavior for critical damping.", 
    "OK, I just get a little, little blip here, OK?", 
    "And this is my critically damped case.", 
    "So don't get confused here, OK?", 
    "It may seem that the frequency curve, the frequency response", 
    "curve for the magnitude of Vc/Vi, somehow looks", 
    "correlated to a flipped version of the time domain", 
    "step response, OK?", 
    "Really, don't get confused by that.", 
    "These are comparing apples and oranges.", 
    "And the similar look and feel is completely", 
    "coincidental, OK?", 
    "The little blip here, the little blip here are not", 
    "directly correlated to each other.", 
    "In one case, in plotting the frequency", 
    "response for sinusoids.", 
    "And in the other case, in plotting the time domain", 
    "behavior for a step response.", 
    "For the step response, this simply says that the voltage", 
    "rises there very quickly.", 
    "It overshoots very slightly and then settles down to its", 
    "final value.", 
    "OK, a very slight overshoot.", 
    "In the frequency domain case, what this is saying is that,", 
    "at omega naught, I am going to get a value which is just ever", 
    "so slightly higher than the initial value, OK?", 
    "And so that is how the two will relate to each other in", 
    "the critical damping case."
