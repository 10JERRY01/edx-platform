    "SPEAKER 1: All right, so from\nthe previous a little module,", 
    "we discovered that we needed a\nnew switch element that would", 
    "enable us to build\nthese gates.", 
    "Now as is going to be a habit\nwith us in EECS, what we&#39;re", 
    "going to do is start by\ninventing an abstract device", 
    "that we assume will behave the\nway we want to and then see if", 
    "that works in designing and\nbuilding the kind of circuits", 
    "we want to build.", 
    "And if that works, then go and\ntry to find some physical", 
    "artifact that behaves like\nthe abstract device", 
    "that we want to build.", 
    "So let&#39;s start by trying\nto be abstract.", 
    "So don&#39;t worry about\nhow it&#39;s built.", 
    "Let&#39;s assume that we have an\nabstract switch device.", 
    "Let me draw an abstract\nswitch device for you.", 
    "So in, out.", 
    "And let&#39;s say the switch device\nhas a control board", 
    "with C.", 
    "So let&#39;s assume, just for fun,\nthat if this is a mechanical", 
    "switch, then the control\npressure, mechanical pressure,", 
    "on C will cause the switch\nto work in a given way.", 
    "So the control it really\ndepends on the kind of", 
    "technology used to\nbuild the switch.", 
    "And for simplicity, simply\nassume that we&#39;re going apply", 
    "some form of control, whether\nit&#39;s mechanical pressure or", 
    "some electrical value.", 
    "And what that will do is cause\nmy switch to behave in the", 
    "following manner.", 
    "So a switch has three\nterminals,", 
    "one, two, and three.", 
    "And let&#39;s see how it behaves.", 
    "So under the condition that C\nis 0, where C is my control,", 
    "then let us say that what I&#39;m\ngoing to get is an open", 
    "circuit between the input\nand the output.", 
    "So this is input and\nthis is the output.", 
    "So if C is 0, then let&#39;s\nassume there&#39;s", 
    "no mechanical pressure.", 
    "So I get an open circuit\nbetween the", 
    "input and the output.", 
    "And so it is open.", 
    "I just noticed here that in\nthe little notation here I", 
    "have reversed the sense of C.\nSo why don&#39;t I change that?", 
    "Why don&#39;t I make it correct\nand say that is a 1?", 
    "That would make more sense.", 
    "Now if I apply mechanical\npressure and call that C equal", 
    "to 1 or I apply, say, a node\nvoltage with a value 1, then", 
    "say C would correspond\nto a logical 1.", 
    "And in that case, the\nwhich behaves in", 
    "the following matter.", 
    "The switch is closed and I get\na short circuit between the", 
    "input and the output.", 
    "So this is a shot and\nthis is a open.", 
    "So when C is a 1, I get a short\ncircuit between the", 
    "input and the output.", 
    "And when C is a 0, I get an open\ncircuit between the input", 
    "and the output.", 
    "So notice that the switch is\nthe three-terminal device.", 
    "There&#39;s a control terminal\nand there&#39;s the", 
    "input and output terminal.", 
    "In virtually all the switches\nthat we will see in 6002 X,", 
    "the two terminals are going\nto be largely symmetric.", 
    "So which is an input and which\nis an output really doesn&#39;t", 
    "matter too much.", 
    "They will be, quite\noften, symmetric.", 
    "So in words, the following\ndescribes the", 
    "behavior of the switch.", 
    "If C is a 1, then I&#39;m going to\nget a short circuit between", 
    "the input and the output.", 
    "And when C is a 0 then I&#39;m going\nto get an open circuit", 
    "between the input\nand the output.", 
    "So imagine this abstract\nswitch.", 
    "And again, as I mentioned\nbefore, don&#39;t worry about", 
    "exactly how we build\nthe switch.", 
    "Imagine I have an abstract\ndevice that", 
    "simply behaves as follows.", 
    "So if I have a device like that,\nthen let met connect up", 
    "this device in the following\nlittle circuit", 
    "and see how it behaves.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do\nis the following.", 
    "So here is my switch, this is\ninput, this is output, and", 
    "this is my control controlled\nterminal.", 
    "And in the electrical domain,\nonce I assign a ground node,", 
    "then C being 0 might have a high\nnode voltage applied to", 
    "it with respect to ground.", 
    "And if C is a 0, then it could\nhave a low voltage applied", 
    "with respect to the ground\nwhich would be kind of", 
    "analogous to mechanical pressure\nbeing there or not.", 
    "So here&#39;s my switch.", 
    "I&#39;m going to connect the\none terminal to ground.", 
    "Then I&#39;m going to connect\nit to a resistor RL.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to take this as\nmy output, I&#39;m going to call", 
    "it Z. And then I have\na resistor RL.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to take that\nresistor and connect that", 
    "to a voltage source with\nvoltage VS and", 
    "connect that to ground.", 
    "So think of VS as providing\na high value.", 
    "And don&#39;t worry about exactly\nwhat the value is, but assume", 
    "that VS provides a logical 1.", 
    "Look at the behavior of this\nlittle pattern that", 
    "I&#39;ve drawn for you.", 
    "Now we will be drawing\ntens or hundreds of", 
    "patterns like this.", 
    "And again, as is the usual\npractice, I&#39;m going to use", 
    "this short form for\nthis pattern.", 
    "I&#39;m going to take the voltage\nsource VS and", 
    "turn it into the following.", 
    "So here&#39;s my switch.", 
    "Here&#39;s my ground node.", 
    "Here&#39;s the control C. And here&#39;s\nthe output Z. And here", 
    "is the resistor RL.", 
    "What I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m\ngoing to turn the voltage, the", 
    "VS supply, into something\nthat looks like this.", 
    "It&#39;s an up arrow with a VS next\nto it, which simply say", 
    "that is my power supply\nconnection.", 
    "So here is my ground connection\nand this is my", 
    "power supply connection\nup here.", 
    "So what I&#39;ve shown you here is\nsimply a shorthand for the", 
    "more detailed circuit\nthat I&#39;ve drawn on", 
    "the left-hand side.", 
    "So in the future, I&#39;m just going\nto be drawing circuits", 
    "like this in a shorthand and\nassume that if I show a VS as", 
    "so, it really means that there&#39;s\na supply voltage VS", 
    "connected to that terminal and\nthen all the way to ground.", 
    "So now that I have this, let&#39;s\ngo to the next step.", 
    "In the next step, let me start\nby redrawing the little", 
    "circuit for you.", 
    "So here&#39;s my switch and\nconnected to ground.", 
    "C is my input, my resistor RL,\nand this goes all the way to", 
    "VS. And I take my output\nZ up here.", 
    "So how does this little\ncircuit behave?", 
    "So let&#39;s look at two Cases One\nis when C equals 0 and the", 
    "second case when C equals 1.", 
    "Let&#39;s take a look at how\nthe switch behaves", 
    "in each of the cases.", 
    "Remember the switch model than\nwe showed you earlier.", 
    "For the switch model, remember\nthat the switch was open", 
    "circuited when C\nwas equal to 0.", 
    "And similarly, when C was equal\nto 1, the switch had a", 
    "short circuit.", 
    "This is input, this is output.", 
    "The switch behavior is such that\nif C is 0, I get an open.", 
    "And if the switch is 1, I get\na closed circuit out here.", 
    "So let&#39;s use these two\nequivalent circuits of the", 
    "switch and redraw our circuit\non the left-hand side with", 
    "these equivalent circuits\nunder the condition", 
    "that C is 0 or 1.", 
    "So when C is 0, what happens?", 
    "Well the switch is open.", 
    "And when the switch is open, I\nget a behavior this is Z, this", 
    "is RL, and this is VS. So I get\nan equivalent circuit that", 
    "looks like that.", 
    "And then when C is a 1, my\nequivalent circuit looks a", 
    "little bit different.", 
    "I get a closed switch in this\ncase that goes to ground.", 
    "And I still have an output Z, I\nhave a resistor RL, and then", 
    "here&#39;s my voltage VS.", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at these\ntwo requirements equivalent", 
    "circuits and try to see\nwhat goes on here.", 
    "OK, so let&#39;s start with\nC equal to 0.", 
    "So when C is equal to 0, not\nthat the switch is open and so", 
    "there&#39;s is an open\ncircuit here.", 
    "And so the voltage VS, which\nis a logical 1, will simply", 
    "appear at the output here.", 
    "In other words, since there&#39;s\nno current that flows down", 
    "here, the entire voltage\nVS will fall", 
    "across this open circuit.", 
    "OK, so I get the entire\nVS appearing here.", 
    "In the lower circuit, something\nelse happens.", 
    "In this case, when C is a 1,\nI get a short circuit.", 
    "And so therefore, the output\nis shorted to the ground.", 
    "And with the output being\nshorted to the ground, I get 0", 
    "volts there.", 
    "OK, so when C is 0, I\nget a high value.", 
    "When C is 1, I get\na low value.", 
    "So I can write that out as a\ntruth table in terms of C and", 
    "Z.", 
    "So Z can take two\nvalues, 0 and 1.", 
    "So what&#39;s happened here?", 
    "When C was 0, I get a high VS\nup there that corresponds", 
    "to a logical 1.", 
    "And when C was 1, I got a low\nvoltage up there and that", 
    "corresponded to a logical 0.", 
    "So you remember this.", 
    "This is the true table\nfor an inverter.", 
    "So this is quite nice.", 
    "If I have a switch and, for now,\nsimply assume magically", 
    "that I have a switch.", 
    "Then if I connect up a switch\nand a resistor in series like", 
    "this in this pattern, then I&#39;m\ngoing to get an inverter", 
    "function between the input\nC and the output Z.", 
    "So let&#39;s look at a slightly\ndifferent example.", 
    "So in the previous case I had\nonce switch and a resistor.", 
    "In this case let&#39;s have some\nmore fun and let&#39;s say I take", 
    "two switches, connect them\nup in series like so.", 
    "And this is controlled by C1 and\nthis is controlled by C2.", 
    "Let&#39;s say connect\nthis to ground.", 
    "And this is case, I connect\nthis to RL.", 
    "And this is my output Z and this\nis my power supply VS.", 
    "So how does this behave?", 
    "Well, in this case, I&#39;m not\ngoing to draw the equivalent", 
    "circuit out.", 
    "You can think through\nit in your mind.", 
    "And in fact, what I&#39;d like to do\nis draw the truth table for", 
    "this connection.", 
    "So the input C1 and C2 could\nbe 0-0, 0-1, 1-0, or 1-1.", 
    "There&#39;s four combinations.", 
    "You have two inputs and\neach of the inputs", 
    "can take on two values.", 
    "Then I get I get four possible\ncombinations of these inputs.", 
    "So let me pause for a second and\nlet you think about what", 
    "might the truth table look\nlike for this structure", 
    "containing two switches\ncontrolled by C1 and C2.",
