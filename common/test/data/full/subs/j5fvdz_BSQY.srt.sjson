    "SPEAKER: Now that you've seen how to analyze a circuit", 
    "containing a MOSFET, I mean essentially we started out by", 
    "saying that in our analog circuits the MOSFETs were", 
    "going to be operating in the saturation region.", 
    "And so we said, OK, let's just assume that they're in the", 
    "saturation region.", 
    "And in the circuit, we simply replaced the MOSFET with a", 
    "dependent source.", 
    "So in the example we used, I had a MOSFET in a circuit that", 
    "looked like this.", 
    "And I simply replaced that MOSFET with a dependent source", 
    "like so, and went there and analyzed the circuit.", 
    "Now, underlying the whole analysis was that the MOSFET", 
    "was in a saturation region of operation.", 
    "So one of the pieces of analysis we have to do is to", 
    "make sure, convince ourselves that these MOSFETs in the", 
    "circuit are indeed in their saturation region.", 
    "And provide some guidance to users that these are the", 
    "limits to the operation.", 
    "So for example, you maybe want to tell a user that if input", 
    "voltage is VI and output is V0, we may want to tell the", 
    "user, hey, look.", 
    "For these values of RL and VS and K for the MOSFET and so", 
    "on, and VT.", 
    "Hey, look, your VT cannot exceed a certain value.", 
    "so your VT cannot go above some value", 
    "3 volts,, or whatever.", 
    "Similarly, we can give them constraints.", 
    "We can give them the corresponding value of V0.", 
    "Now, this class of analysis is given a name.", 
    "We call it large signal analysis.", 
    "So large signal analysis has two steps to it.", 
    "The first step is to simply figure out V0 versus VI.", 
    "So the large signal analysis of these circuits--", 
    "in this case, the MOSFET amplifier, and this could be", 
    "true for any other circuit containing these MOSFETs.", 
    "We first find out the input versus output relationship.", 
    "As a second step, we find out the valid regions of operation", 
    "for the MOSFET in that circuit.", 
    "So what you have to do is you find out what is a valid input", 
    "operating rage.", 
    "And then you find the corresponding valid output", 
    "operating range.", 
    "And these ranges have to be chosen to guarantee saturation", 
    "region operation.", 
    "So for the MOSFET to be in saturation, we need to create,", 
    "what are the limits of operation for the MOSFET in", 
    "that given circuit.", 
    "So let's go back to our example, and let's go ahead", 
    "and do Steps 1 and 2.", 
    "So Step 1 was pretty straightforward.", 
    "Step 1 was now go and figure out what V0 versus VI were.", 
    "And so we've done this before.", 
    "So I won't do the analysis for you again.", 
    "You could use the node method if you like, and just write", 
    "down the answer.", 
    "If you recall, we got V0 was VS minus iDS times RL, where", 
    "iDS was K divided by 2 VI minus VT all squared times RL.", 
    "And again, just to refresh your memories, this was for", 
    "out MOSFET circuit that looked like this.", 
    "V0, RL, VS, and the MOSFET had a threshold voltage VT.", 
    "And the MOSFET had parameter K. So this equation here was", 
    "what we obtained.", 
    "And of course, this was valid for saturation region of the", 
    "MOSFET, which were the two constraints VI greater than or", 
    "equal to VT and V0 greater than or equal to VI minus VT.", 
    "Now we can go ahead and plot this value just for fun.", 
    "So let me get a couple axes going here.", 
    "So this is VI.", 
    "And I want to plot V0 versus VI for you.", 
    "And so there's a couple of interesting regions here.", 
    "Notice that this is V0 for VI greater than or equal to VT.", 
    "And V0 equals VS for VI less than VT.", 
    "So let me mark VT down here.", 
    "And so for VI less than VT--", 
    "this is VS. For less than VT, I get a curve", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "So for VI less than VT, I just get the value of V0 being VS.", 
    "Then, as VI increases, I switch to this equation here.", 
    "And notice that I'm subtracting some quadratic", 
    "function of VI from VS. And so I'm going to see a sharp", 
    "drop-off, a quadratic drop-off in the value of V0.", 
    "And that is related to VS minus K divided by 2 VI minus", 
    "VT all squared RL.", 
    "So something interesting happens here.", 
    "So this keeps going down and down and down and so on.", 
    "And so what happens as it goes down?", 
    "Now you recall the little discussion we had--", 
    "the little chat we had earlier, where we said that if", 
    "this was a truly abstract dependent source, did not", 
    "really have a practical MOSFET.", 
    "But if I had a truly ideal dependent source where great", 
    "things happened and I did not have to worry about saturation", 
    "region of operation, then this behavior would continue and", 
    "this equation here would hold.", 
    "However, my MOSFET is a practical device.", 
    "And my MOSFET is such that its behavior", 
    "changes at this point.", 
    "It no longer behaves like a current source.", 
    "And in fact, we look at this in more detail later.", 
    "But this is a point where it turns out V0", 
    "equals VI minus VT.", 
    "So when V0 equals VI minus VT here, then this curve begins", 
    "to go funky on me.", 
    "And this curve begins to look like this.", 
    "And so here the MOSFET gets into its triode region.", 
    "This is the region where saturation", 
    "operation doesn't apply.", 
    "And at this part here, V0 is going to be less", 
    "than VI minus VT.", 
    "Notice as my V0 goes down, I exit the saturation region.", 
    "And up here, V0 is greater than or equal to VI minus VT.", 
    "So at this point it's equal and at that point it is-- let", 
    "me just mark that as greater than VI minus VT.", 
    "Because this is the point at which V0 equals VI minus VT.", 
    "Let me go back and show you a little demo.", 
    "In this demo, I am going to show you a little", 
    "demonstration of how the MOSFET curve behaves as I", 
    "increase my VI.", 
    "And you'll want to observe how V0 behaves.", 
    "And keep a watch on this point when V0 equals VI minus VT.", 
    "So what is happening here?", 
    "So as VI increases, as I increase my VI, V0 keeps", 
    "dropping, until at some point--", 
    "at this point, my VI is such that V0 equals VI minus VT.", 
    "In other words, if VI is say, for example, 3 volts, and if", 
    "VT equals 1 volt.", 
    "Then, in this case, V0 will be equal to 2 volts.", 
    "So V0 is one threshold below VI, and that's where I exit", 
    "the saturation region.", 
    "Let's move on and take a look at our demo."
