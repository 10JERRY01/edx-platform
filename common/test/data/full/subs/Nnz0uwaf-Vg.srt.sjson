    "SPEAKER 1: You just saw capacitors for the first time", 
    "aside from these sequences, and you saw how to solve", 
    "capacitor problems using differential equations.", 
    "So, given a circuit like this, you could write the equations", 
    "for it using nodal analysis, and they come out like this,", 
    "and this is actually kind of painful to work with.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And indeed, one thing we know, of course, is", 
    "we start with a simplification here where the capacitor can", 
    "be described in terms of its derivative relationship.", 
    "The current is the current it passes times the rate of", 
    "change of the voltage across it.", 
    "However, what I'm about to do is make another circuit which", 
    "is analogous to this circuit which has, in fact, only", 
    "resistors and sources, by replacing the capacitor with a", 
    "special object Cs, such that the current through it in a--", 
    "the complex amplitude of the current through", 
    "is the actual words--", 
    "is Cs, where s is a complex frequency times the complex", 
    "amplitude of the voltage across it.", 
    "Once I do that--", 
    "oh, could we just point out, Cs here is a conductance.", 
    "If we would write this as a resistance or impedance, it", 
    "would be 1 over Cs.", 
    "So just be careful with that.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: That's right.", 
    "OK, now, once I've done that, then I can do", 
    "something really wild.", 
    "I can replace this circuit with this circuit for the", 
    "purposes of our study.", 
    "That doesn't mean it's the same circuit.", 
    "What it is is a circuit such that the properties of this", 
    "circuit are in one to one correspondence with the", 
    "properties of this circuit.", 
    "I can determine everything there is to know about this", 
    "circuit by just determining things about this circuit.", 
    "But this is purely resistive, and it contains only sources.", 
    "So I can write down the algebraic equation here,", 
    "that's like that, and if you look carefully, you'll see", 
    "that that algebraic equation is in one to one", 
    "correspondence with the differential equation for the", 
    "original circuit."
