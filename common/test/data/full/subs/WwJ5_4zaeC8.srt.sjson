    "SPEAKER: Now let's have some fun.", 
    "So this was node A, this was node B,", 
    "this was node C, right?", 
    "So we saw so far that because of the 2 kilohms and the CGS,", 
    "the rise at this node was very slow, because this", 
    "mode rose up slowly.", 
    "And because this node rose up slowly, the voltage took some", 
    "time to get to VT, and because of that, there was a delay at", 
    "C.", 
    "So what do we do?", 
    "Let us try to speed up our inverter and see if we can", 
    "change the behavior and make it go faster at node B. So", 
    "what I'm going to do is try to speed up this little circuit", 
    "here, speed up node B in particular.", 
    "So how might I do that?", 
    "How much I go ahead and speed up node B?", 
    "Well, I have to reduce the time constant.", 
    "And we can say, hey, let's go change CGS.", 
    "But CGS is there.", 
    "I didn't want it to begin with.", 
    "So I can't change that.", 
    "I didn't want it to begin with.", 
    "I have not much control over it and it's there.", 
    "So there are two resistances I can think about.", 
    "One is the R on for this MOSFET, and if you recall, the", 
    "falling time constant was very small.", 
    "R on was very small, and so the circuit switched down very", 
    "quickly, as you saw from the demo.", 
    "The problem was the rising delay.", 
    "The rising was very slow, and the rising was because of the", 
    "current having to go through a 2-kilohm resistor and then", 
    "charge up the capacitor CGS.", 
    "So the obvious thing to do is then to try to reduce RL, or", 
    "the 2-kilohm resistor.", 
    "So why don't I do the following.", 
    "In the demo that I have set up for you, here", 
    "is what I've done.", 
    "I have put a very small resistor--", 
    "in this case, a 50-ohm resistor--", 
    "in parallel with the 2-kilohm resistor, and I have connected", 
    "a switch like so.", 
    "So what I can do is if I close the switch, if I shut the", 
    "switch, then the 50-ohm resistor comes in parallel", 
    "with the 2-kilohm resistor, making the effective parallel", 
    "resistance more or less 50 ohms. And that should speed up", 
    "this little node really well.", 
    "So if this was time and this was VB, and this is what I", 
    "have so far, and if I switch to the 50-ohm resistor, what", 
    "do I expect?", 
    "I expect something to look like this.", 
    "This was 2 kilohms, and I expect something to look like", 
    "this, my 50-ohm to be much faster.", 
    "I expect it to shoot up very quickly and get", 
    "to its 5-volt value.", 
    "So let me write down 5 volts here.", 
    "So to recap very quickly, this is slow.", 
    "The circuit is slow.", 
    "VB is rising slowly.", 
    "So I say, hey, let's introduce the resistance value through", 
    "which the capacitor CGS is charging.", 
    "And that should make it charge up much faster by using the", 
    "time constant.", 
    "So I'm going to stick this 50-ohm resistor in parallel to", 
    "the 2-kilohm resistor, just for fun here, to make my", 
    "circuit go faster.", 
    "That's the obvious thing to do.", 
    "And I'm going to do that, for the purpose of the demo, so I", 
    "can switch it on an off, switch it into the circuit and", 
    "out of the circuit, so I can show you the demo--", 
    "I'm going to put a little switch here.", 
    "So what I'll do is I'm going to show you another demo, and", 
    "I'm going to close the switch.", 
    "I'm going to close this switch here like so, and I'm going to", 
    "show you a demo with the 50-ohm in parallel.", 
    "And you will have some fun, a lot of fun.", 
    "So let me write down what I'm going to be doing, and then", 
    "let's dive into the demo.", 
    "And I won't tell you what you're going to see, and I", 
    "will just surprised you.", 
    "It's a mind-blowing experience in terms of what you're going", 
    "to see next.", 
    "Let's just quickly write this down.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So there you go.", 
    "I've written that up so you have it in your notes.", 
    "And let's dive right into the demo and see some really,", 
    "really fun stuff.", 
    "So remember, you expect to see a much faster rising waveform,", 
    "and you expect you troubles to all go away.", 
    "But this is just the beginning of a", 
    "really interesting problem."
