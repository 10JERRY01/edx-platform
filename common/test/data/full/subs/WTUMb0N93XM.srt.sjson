    "SPEAKER: OK, let me show you a slightly different way of", 
    "writing the differential equation very, very quickly.", 
    "This is a really intuitive way of doing that.", 
    "Throughout this course, whenever I get a chance, I'm", 
    "going to show you some simple intuitive way of doing things,", 
    "where you can often times get rid of a lot of the", 
    "mathematics and so on, and get to the answer directly.", 
    "And at the end of the sequence, you will see how we", 
    "do that for the properties of RLC circuits.", 
    "And here I want to show you how we can do that, how we can", 
    "very quickly write down the differential equation for the", 
    "circuit based on direct observation of the circuit.", 
    "So here's the circuit that we have. It's an RLC circuit.", 
    "And in the previous case I used the node method.", 
    "I always try to use standard techniques where I can.", 
    "And then I can show you so that", 
    "technique will always work.", 
    "But here, let me show you a simple approach to doing this,", 
    "that can get through a lot of the grubbiness of", 
    "the previous method.", 
    "So I want to use the KVL method basically.", 
    "So I'll write the KVL for this loop going around in a", 
    "clockwise manner.", 
    "And what I'll do is I'll try to figure out the voltages", 
    "across each of the elements, OK?", 
    "So this is vR, this is vL, and let's say this is vI, and of", 
    "course I have v for the capacitor.", 
    "So what I'll do is I'll first find out i.", 
    "nce I find out i for this series circuit, then I'll go", 
    "ahead and write down vR and vL, and then use KVL to sum", 
    "them all up.", 
    "So I know vI--", 
    "I'm sorry, I know the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor is v, all right?", 
    "Now, to get the voltage across the", 
    "resistor, I need the current.", 
    "So I know that i is simply C dv dt.", 
    "So I start by anchoring myself and picking the voltage v,", 
    "that's what I want to solve for.", 
    "And then from that voltage, I want to try to find i and then", 
    "vR and then vL, all in terms of the voltage", 
    "v, one after another.", 
    "So the capacitor voltage is given by C dv dt, that same", 
    "voltage must flow through the resistor.", 
    "Which means that the voltage vR through the resistor is", 
    "simply R times i, which is C dv dt.", 
    "That was easy.", 
    "Next, let me find the voltage across the inductor, and that", 
    "is also easy. vL is simply L di by dt.", 
    "What is di by dt?", 
    "Well, that is L times d by dt of C dv dt.", 
    "So di by dt from here is simply C d", 
    "squared v by dt squared.", 
    "So I get di by dt is simply C d squared v by dt squared, and", 
    "that is vL.", 
    "So this is the drop across the resistor, this is the drop", 
    "across the inductor, and v, of course, is the", 
    "drop across the capacitor.", 
    "So I can start writing KVL very quickly.", 
    "Recall the method for KVL.", 
    "I would go around the loop summing the", 
    "voltages as I saw them.", 
    "And since the sum adds up to zero, it doesn't matter", 
    "whether I go in a clockwise manner or", 
    "anti-clockwise manner.", 
    "I'll go in a clockwise manner.", 
    "And recall the convention, the convention I like to follow is", 
    "to be consistent.", 
    "As I encounter each sign for each of the branch variables,", 
    "like vL and so on, I just use the sign as the first sign", 
    "that I encounter.", 
    "So I'll use vL, then I go around the loop, I encounter", 
    "vR, then I encounter plus v and then I come around and I", 
    "encounter minus vI, and they will sum to 0.", 
    "So let's go in and write these things down. vL is simply LC d", 
    "squared v by dt squared.", 
    "vR is simply RC dv by dt, and then v is of course v, and I", 
    "can move vI to the right hand side, and you are done.", 
    "Very quickly, I was able to write down the same second", 
    "order differential equation by using a little bit of", 
    "intuition, and I didn't have to go around trying to", 
    "eliminate va and so on and so forth.", 
    "Now, trying to figure out when to use this method and how to", 
    "use these tricks comes from experience.", 
    "And I'll show you the intuition of it", 
    "whenever I get a chance.", 
    "So following this, we'll go down and start solving the", 
    "second order differential equation."
