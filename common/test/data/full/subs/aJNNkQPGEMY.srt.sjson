    "So what I'll do is, we've plotted for you for the MOSFET", 
    "all its characteristics in its full glory for a whole bunch", 
    "of values of vGS and a whole bunch of values of vDS.", 
    "And let me stare at those curves with you for a few", 
    "seconds and walk you through them.", 
    "So what do I have here?", 
    "One of these curves corresponds to a", 
    "given value of vGS.", 
    "This may be vGS equals 2 volts.", 
    "This is vDS, the range of source voltage, and this is", 
    "the current.", 
    "So focus on this curve for now.", 
    "So in the beginning, I hid the right-hand side behavior from", 
    "you, and showed you just the resistive behavior out here.", 
    "But I increased VDS to be much larger, the current saturated,", 
    "and I got the saturation region", 
    "operation of the MOSFET.", 
    "And notice, as I increase my value of VGS, the saturation", 
    "current also increases according to", 
    "a square law behavior.", 
    "So these are the entire curves of the MOSFET.", 
    "Finally the truth comes out.", 
    "And notice that when vDS is less than vGS minus Vt, more", 
    "or less resistive behavior.", 
    "But when vDS is greater than vGS minus vT, I get current", 
    "source-like behavior."
