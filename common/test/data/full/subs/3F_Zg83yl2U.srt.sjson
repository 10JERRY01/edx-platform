    "OK, I hope you had a chance to try it out", 
    "in the little exercise.", 
    "So here's my particular equation.", 
    "So what is a reasonable solution?", 
    "Well, I need some solution that will equal the right-hand", 
    "side, but whose first and second derivatives goes to", 
    "zero because I have a vp here.", 
    "So why don't I try vp equals vi.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So if I substitute vi here, this will go to zero.", 
    "If I substitute vi the second term, that goes to zero.", 
    "And so here I'm left with 1 by LC, vi, and here I'm left with", 
    "1 by LC, vi.", 
    "Aha, so that works.", 
    "OK, so this works.", 
    "So vp equals vi is a particular solution.", 
    "All right, now all that I've done so far is find a solution", 
    "that satisfies the equation for the given input value.", 
    "OK, and since vp equals capital V capital I works,", 
    "that is a particular solution.", 
    "Notice again that with solving differential equations, it", 
    "actually turns out to be quite easy because you end up using", 
    "a lot of guess and check.", 
    "All right, so let's move on to our next step, and let's try", 
    "to figure out the homogeneous solution.", 
    "That's the second step of my solving the", 
    "differential equation.", 
    "So I hope you remember what the homogeneous solution was.", 
    "It is a solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "OK, so it is a solution to the homogeneous equation, which is", 
    "d squared--", 
    "vH is the homogeneous solution--", 
    "dt squared plus r divided by l, dvH, dt, plus 1 by LC, vH,", 
    "and the homogeneous equation is the original equation with", 
    "the drive set to zero.", 
    "OK, so let's write that down.", 
    "So vH is the solution to the homogeneous equation.", 
    "Solution to the homogeneous equation, which is the", 
    "original equation with the drive set to zero.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So that's my homogeneous equation.", 
    "I've set the drive to zero.", 
    "And as you recall, I've been using a four-step method to", 
    "solve the homogeneous equation.", 
    "OK, so let's write down what those four steps are.", 
    "So there's a step 2A, there's a step 2B, there's a step 2C,", 
    "and finally a step 2D.", 
    "Four steps.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So the steps that I'm going to follow are these.", 
    "I'm going to start by, again, you guessed it.", 
    "Well, I'm going to start with a guess.", 
    "I'm going to assume a solution of the form vH is Ae raised to", 
    "st, where A and s are unknowns.", 
    "I don't know what a and s are.", 
    "You see very quickly why we choose, why we use this guess", 
    "for a homogenous solution of the form e raised to st. And", 
    "the reason is that the exponential is one of those", 
    "forms where the form of the function differentiated is the", 
    "same as the form of the function itself.", 
    "OK, and since a differential equation has v and dvdt and d", 
    "squared, v by dt squared, by using e raised to st, I'm", 
    "going to get an e raised to st form in each of", 
    "these terms, OK?", 
    "So it's very highly likely that that is going to be a", 
    "workable solution.", 
    "So pretty much in all our solutions of differential", 
    "equations in 6.002x, we follow the same", 
    "standard practice, OK?", 
    "We pick a homogeneous solution of the form Ae raised to st.", 
    "OK, the next step, we form what is called the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "It will be some function of s.", 
    "OK, this is going to be extremely important.", 
    "OK, you will soon find out that you can write down the", 
    "characteristic equation of a circuit very quickly, and then", 
    "that will tell you pretty much all that you want to know", 
    "about the dynamics of the system.", 
    "So once you write the characteristic equation--", 
    "in this case it will be a second order equation--", 
    "you will next find the roots of the", 
    "characteristic equation.", 
    "We will call those roots s1 and s2.", 
    "And then, finally, we will construct the general solution", 
    "of the homogeneous equation.", 
    "Notice that we are working on the homogeneous solution.", 
    "We're not working on the total solution yet, OK?", 
    "So the general solution of the homogeneous equation will fold", 
    "in both the roots.", 
    "And so vH will be sub Ae raised to s1t plus", 
    "a2e raised to s2t.", 
    "OK, I'm folding in both the roots", 
    "into my general solution.", 
    "So this is what I'm going to do, all right?", 
    "So I'm going to follow steps 2A through 2D to find the", 
    "homogeneous solution.", 
    "And I've given you the steps and a summary of the method.", 
    "And the next video, I'm going to go ahead and apply these", 
    "steps to our example and then go on to the total solution", 
    "after I'm done with that."
