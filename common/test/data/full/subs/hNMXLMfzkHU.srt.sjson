    "SPEAKER 1: Now that we know how to develop small signal", 
    "models for each of our two terminal components and we", 
    "also saw how to create a small signal element model for our", 
    "three-terminal MOSFET, which was a voltage-controlled", 
    "current source, let's now dive into an example, OK?", 
    "Let's look at the example of our MOSFET amplifier.", 
    "And let's analyze that directly using the small", 
    "signal circuit method.", 
    "OK, let's start with step one.", 
    "So step one of the method simply says, find the", 
    "operating point from the large signal model.", 
    "OK, if you're given that, the input operating point is", 
    "capital V, capital I.", 
    "Then find the rest of the operating point parameters", 
    "using a large signal model.", 
    "OK, so we've done this before, so I won't bore you with all", 
    "the details.", 
    "But let me very quickly write this down and show you what", 
    "this looks like, OK?", 
    "So let me go ahead and write down the model here.", 
    "So I get the voltage, VI.", 
    "I replace the MOSFET with its dependent current source.", 
    "And that is iDS, so this is the gate.", 
    "This is the drain.", 
    "This is the source.", 
    "And up here I have the resistance, RL.", 
    "And the whole thing gets connected to a supply, VS.", 
    "That, in turn, goes to ground.", 
    "Then I take my output voltage, V naught, out here.", 
    "And for the MOSFET, the large signal value for the current,", 
    "in terms of the source voltage, is given by VGS minus", 
    "VT all squared.", 
    "And in this case, VGS is the same as VI.", 
    "So I just go ahead and write that down as VT", 
    "all squared, OK?", 
    "Note that, in general, VI is not equal to VGS.", 
    "And at the end of the sequence, I'm going to take a", 
    "few minutes to show you an example where VI is not equal", 
    "to VGS, OK?", 
    "So don't fall into that trap of using VI", 
    "equals VGS all the time.", 
    "We can now do a large signal analysis and figure out V", 
    "naught, in terms of the large signal value of VI.", 
    "I won't go through the method, but I just remind you, the way", 
    "you do that is you apply the node method here.", 
    "So you sum currents, V naught minus VS divided by R to the", 
    "current going up.", 
    "And iDS is the current going down.", 
    "And then you replace for iDS using this equation.", 
    "So doing so and moving terms around, you can get VS minus", 
    "K/2 VI minus VT all squared times RL, OK?", 
    "So this is the large signal analysis.", 
    "And you can then find the operating point.", 
    "So for example, if I pick capital V capital I for my DC", 
    "input VI, then this will be my V naught, OK?", 
    "Similarly, iDS will be given by this iDS, if I substitute", 
    "capital V, capital I for VI.", 
    "All right, that's step one of the small signal circuit", 
    "analysis method.", 
    "Now the next question is, how do I go about creating the", 
    "small signal model?", 
    "OK, I go with step two.", 
    "And with step two, my goal is to find out small signal", 
    "models for each of the elements.", 
    "I need to go develop the small signal model.", 
    "And step two says, go and find the small signal models for", 
    "each of the elements.", 
    "So let me go ahead and draw my large signal circuit.", 
    "So just to be clear, this is the large signal circuit", 
    "because I say LS just to make clear this is a", 
    "large signal circuit.", 
    "And I have a bunch of components in this large", 
    "signal circuit.", 
    "OK, I have a voltage source, a dependent voltage source, a", 
    "resistor and so on because I am going to go and develop", 
    "small signal models for each of these elements, OK?", 
    "So let's go ahead and figure that out.", 
    "All right, let's start with the easy one, OK?", 
    "So the resistor is easy.", 
    "OK, the small signal model for the resistor is RL itself.", 
    "I will replace RL with its small signal", 
    "model, which is RL itself.", 
    "What about VS, the supply?", 
    "OK, the supply, since it's a DC supply, its small signal", 
    "model will be a short circuit, OK?", 
    "So I'll replace VS with a short circuit.", 
    "VI, in the case of VI, we'll have a DC offset, capital V,", 
    "capital I, plus a small signal value for VI.", 
    "So I will replace that with its small signal input Vi.", 
    "Finally, there's a MOSFET, the three-terminal MOSFET.", 
    "And what do I do there?", 
    "Well, let me just draw out the MOSFET for you, OK?", 
    "So this is my drain.", 
    "This is my source.", 
    "And this is my gate.", 
    "OK, my gate's source voltage is vgs, small v, small gs.", 
    "And you recall, the small signal model for the MOSFET", 
    "was itself a vccs.", 
    "And the current was iDS.", 
    "And recall that the current iDS for the vccs was given by", 
    "K, capital V, capital GS minus VT times small vgs.", 
    "So I'm simply replacing the MOSFET.", 
    "I will replace the MOSFET, the large signal MOSFET model,", 
    "which is given by this here.", 
    "I will replace that by the MOSFET small signal model,", 
    "which is a three-terminal device.", 
    "It's a linear, voltage-controlled current", 
    "source whose current iDS was related to the DC values of", 
    "Vgs minus VT times the small signal vgs, OK?", 
    "So in my next step, in my step three, I will replace each of", 
    "the large signal models when their small signal", 
    "equivalents.", 
    "OK, so let me go ahead and do that as my next step.", 
    "So here is my next step.", 
    "Starting out, I will replace the elements of the original", 
    "circuit, replace the large signal elements with their", 
    "small signal equivalent models.", 
    "OK, so in order to do that, here is my", 
    "large signal circuit.", 
    "And in this large signal circuit--", 
    "this is my original circuit--", 
    "what I'm going to do is I am going to replace each of these", 
    "elements with their small signal models.", 
    "OK, so to start, let me first punch out these elements, OK?", 
    "So I have taken away the input source.", 
    "I have taken away the output source.", 
    "I've taken away RL.", 
    "I've taken away iDS, the MOSFET.", 
    "So I just left the basic circuit topology.", 
    "And now I'm going to stick in the small signal models in", 
    "place of these large signal values.", 
    "OK, let me start with the resistor.", 
    "So I'm going to put my resistor here.", 
    "RL, that's my small signal model for the resistor.", 
    "For my source, that's easy.", 
    "I'm going to replace the source with a short circuit.", 
    "So that's a short.", 
    "I'm going to replace my input with a small signal input, OK?", 
    "And the reason is that the total variable is the sum of", 
    "the DC plus the small signal.", 
    "So the small signal model is just a small signal source.", 
    "OK, so the next step is I'm going to replace the MOSFET", 
    "with its current source, given by ids where I know that ids", 
    "is equal to K times Vgs minus VT times small v, small gs.", 
    "And in this case, small v, small gs is the voltage", 
    "between the gate and source terminals.", 
    "And this is simply VI, OK?", 
    "So ids, my MOSFET current, is related to K times Vgs minus", 
    "VT times vgs.", 
    "And as we've seen before, we often substitute gm for this,", 
    "the trans-conductance.", 
    "And so the shorthand notation would be ids equals gm Vi, OK?", 
    "So that's my step three, OK?", 
    "I've replaced all the large signal elements with their", 
    "small signal equivalent models.", 
    "And voila.", 
    "Here is the small signal circuit.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "So I can then go ahead and simply analyze the small", 
    "signal circuit as my next step.", 
    "And let me label this with V naught.", 
    "That is my small signal output.", 
    "All right, let me go ahead and wrap up the example.", 
    "And what I'm going to do now, now that I have the small", 
    "signal circuit model, I need to go and analyze the", 
    "resulting small signal circuit using methods known to me.", 
    "And in this case, it's a pretty simple analysis.", 
    "I have Vi here, Vi at this node, Vi.", 
    "And I need to find out small v, small o at that node.",
