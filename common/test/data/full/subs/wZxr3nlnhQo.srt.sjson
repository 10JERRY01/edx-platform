    "SPEAKER 1: Let's try to make some sense out of this", 
    "equation here.", 
    "This was a total solution.", 
    "It was VI which was the step input for t greater than zero,", 
    "plus A1 times some exponential, plus A2 times", 
    "some other exponential.", 
    "So they're rewriting that ever so slightly by just teasing", 
    "out e raised to alpha t from here and here, and leaving the", 
    "squared root term separate.", 
    "So I've just rewritten this by a very slight bit.", 
    "So I'd like to stare at this for a little bit, and try to", 
    "get a sense of what is going on here.", 
    "In particular, I would like to stare at this thing here.", 
    "Square root of alpha squared minus omega naught.", 
    "All right?", 
    "Let's stare at this.", 
    "All right, here we go.", 
    "Let's start staring at this.", 
    "Let's get some angry eyes.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Let's look at this stuff and stare", 
    "at this rather carefully.", 
    "OK, what do you see?", 
    "So there's alpha and omega naught, of course.", 
    "And if you recall, alpha was then related to R and L. What", 
    "was it, R divided by 2L.", 
    "So alpha was R divided by 2L, and omega naught was one by", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So as you look at this under the square root sign, there's", 
    "something interesting happening here.", 
    "When alpha is greater than omega naught, the stuff inside", 
    "the square root sign is positive, so I get a real", 
    "value as a square root.", 
    "However, if that quantity, alpha squared minus omega", 
    "naught squared, or alpha versus omega is such that it", 
    "is negative--", 
    "in other words, if omega is bigger than alpha--", 
    "then I get a square root of a negative number.", 
    "OK, so I get the imaginary value.", 
    "Very, very interesting things happen.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So let's tease this apart, and we can identify three cases", 
    "here for how the values of alpha and omega are related to", 
    "each other.", 
    "The first case, as we discussed, is the pretty", 
    "straightforward case when alpha is", 
    "greater than omega naught.", 
    "This case is called the overdamped case.", 
    "It kind of makes sense.", 
    "Damping relates to R, and when R is very large, there is more", 
    "damping, for whatever that means for now.", 
    "The second case is when alpha is less than omega naught, in", 
    "this case the quantity under the square root sign becomes", 
    "negative, and very interesting things happen.", 
    "We call this the underdamped case.", 
    "And we'll look at all these in more detail.", 
    "And then, of course, the obvious third case, alpha", 
    "equals omega naught.", 
    "This is called the critically damped case.", 
    "All right?", 
    "So let's look at each of these three cases in turn, and try", 
    "to make sense of how the system behaves in each of the", 
    "three situations.", 
    "Let's do the simple one first. Let's do the case where alpha", 
    "is greater than omega naught.", 
    "This is the overdamped case.", 
    "So in this case, if alpha is greater than omega naught,", 
    "take a look at this.", 
    "If you look at this quantity, A1 e raised to minus alpha t e", 
    "raised to square root of alpha squared minus omega naught", 
    "squared times t.", 
    "This will be some positive quantity.", 
    "OK?", 
    "e raised to some quantity, and again, e raised to some other", 
    "quantity here, both being real and not imaginary, I can", 
    "simply rewrite that as follows.", 
    "I can rewrite the whole thing as v of t, the total solution", 
    "as V of I plus A1 and e of minus alpha t and e of some", 
    "other real quantity.", 
    "Now, let me just call it something else.", 
    "Let me just call it minus a small a1 of t and plus, let me", 
    "just call it small alpha.", 
    "And then A2 e raised to minus alpha 2 of t, where alpha 1", 
    "and alpha 2 are related to these quantities here.", 
    "So, notice that this is a very straightforward case.", 
    "I get VI plus some decaying exponentials.", 
    "I won't bother to develop the constants out for you.", 
    "But let me show you what the wave", 
    "form is for this scenario.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So in this case, this is v of t, and my input", 
    "is 0, this is vI.", 
    "So my input is a step at time t equal to 0 that's going to", 
    "capital VI.", 
    "And my output is going to be something", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "It is going to be related to exponentials.", 
    "And I haven't told you what the constants are, but knowing", 
    "what the situation is, and since I know what the answer's", 
    "going to look like, I can just sketch it out for you.", 
    "It's going to look something like this.", 
    "Nothing like sinusoids.", 
    "No sinusoids.", 
    "And the reason is that R plays a dominant role here and damps", 
    "out any of these oscillations or ringing kinds of things", 
    "that we see.", 
    "So in this case, it is an overdamped situation.", 
    "Where is the final value of v here?", 
    "Well, we can figure that out pretty easily.", 
    "When time t goes to infinity, both of these terms go to 0,", 
    "and so, after a long period of time, I am going", 
    "to get a value VI.", 
    "So that makes sense, right?", 
    "If you look at the circuit here, you have my voltage", 
    "source, I had an inductor, a resistor and a capacitor.", 
    "And I'm thinking about the voltage v.", 
    "Now, in this situation, if after a long period of time I", 
    "let the whole thing settle down, and if this input was at", 
    "VI, then the inductor is going to look like a long term short", 
    "circuit, and the capacitor's going to look like a long term", 
    "open circuit.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So what I would expect to see happen is, this would charge", 
    "up and eventually I get a voltage VI at this point, and", 
    "then the system cuts to rest. OK?", 
    "So that intuitively seems correct as well.", 
    "And mathematically I get the same thing.", 
    "So this is how the circuit is going to behave, no sinusoids,", 
    "this is the overdamped case."
