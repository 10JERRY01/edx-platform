    "SPEAKER: So now we have our work cut out for us.", 
    "Here is our differential equation.", 
    "Lc d squared v by dt squared plus v equals vI.", 
    "Let's go ahead and solve this.", 
    "And we will use the same technique we've been using so", 
    "far in this course.", 
    "We just use the same method to solve all our", 
    "differential equations.", 
    "Do you recall that method?", 
    "It was the method of homogeneous", 
    "and particular solutions.", 
    "Recall, the method had three steps.", 
    "The first step of those three was to find", 
    "the particular solution.", 
    "Let's write that down.", 
    "The second step of the method was to find", 
    "a homogeneous solution.", 
    "Here, there's going to be a slight variation.", 
    "In finding the homogeneous solution, we are going to use", 
    "four steps to do it.", 
    "This will be a four-step process.", 
    "And then, our third step is the usual third step of the", 
    "method of homogeneous and particular solutions, which is", 
    "to create the total solution, where the total solution is", 
    "the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions.", 
    "And then you use the initial conditions to solve for the", 
    "remaining constants.", 
    "So let's go ahead and write that down for our notes.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Three steps.", 
    "Find particular, find homogeneous solution, and that", 
    "the total solution will be the sum of the particular and", 
    "homogeneous.", 
    "And then go ahead and find the remaining constants.", 
    "So let's suppose that our particular solution is given", 
    "by vp of t The homogeneous solution is given by vH of t.", 
    "And so then our total solution, v of t, is given by", 
    "vp of t plus vH of t.", 
    "So let's go ahead and flesh out the problem", 
    "a little bit more.", 
    "So as you know, a differential equation is L squared d", 
    "squared v by dt squared, plus v equals vI.", 
    "And what did we say?", 
    "Let's pick the vI for which I will do the example solution.", 
    "So what if we go ahead and, as an example--", 
    "what shall I do?", 
    "Why don't I pick a step input?", 
    "Let's go ahead and pick a step input for vI.", 
    "So let me draw the step input for you.", 
    "At 0, this is vI, and here's my step input.", 
    "We're at time t equal to 0.", 
    "The input vI steps from 0 to capital VI volts.", 
    "That's my step input.", 
    "Let me also go ahead and pick initial conditions for my two", 
    "state variables, V across the capacitor and the current", 
    "through my inductor.", 
    "So voltage across the capacitor at time t", 
    "equal to 0 is 0.", 
    "And let's say the current through the inductor at time t", 
    "equal to 0 is also 0.", 
    "So in other words, what I am looking for is the zero-state", 
    "response, because my initial conditions for both my state", 
    "variables--", 
    "the current through the conductor and voltage across", 
    "the capacitor--", 
    "has been picked to be 0.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So let's dive in and solve the problem.", 
    "So again, three steps-- particular, homogeneous, and", 
    "then you sum the two and find the remaining unknowns.", 
    "So the first step to solve my differential equation is to go", 
    "find a particular solution.", 
    "So recall the differential equation was Lc d squared v by", 
    "dt squared plus v equals vI.", 
    "So the particular solution is any solution to", 
    "the following equation.", 
    "So I take Lc d squared vp by dt squared, where vp is my", 
    "particular solution, plus vp is equal to vI", 
    "where vI is my input.", 
    "So for the input vI, I've been told that for t greater than", 
    "or equal to 0, my input vI is capital V, capital I. It's a", 
    "step input, and so it is capital V, capital I. So I go", 
    "ahead and substitute this value in, and so any solution", 
    "for vp that satisfies the particular equation here will", 
    "be a solution.", 
    "So why don't you go and try to solve it for yourselves, and", 
    "let's go to the next video, and I will work on the", 
    "solution for you."
