    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "So let me proceed here.", 
    "I&#39;ve applied a force, F. And I\nhave asked you the question,", 
    "what is the acceleration?", 
    "OK?", 
    "Now, the answer here\nis pretty simple.", 
    "What you would do, given that\nyou&#39;ve taken physics,", 
    "mechanics, and so on, you would\nvery quickly ask me what", 
    "is the mass of the object, m.", 
    "And I would very quickly\ntell you the mass of", 
    "the object is m.", 
    "And then, you would very quickly\nrespond that the", 
    "acceleration is given by the\nforce divided by the mass of", 
    "the object.", 
    "Gives you the acceleration.", 
    "So that was pretty simple.", 
    "So you asked me for m.", 
    "I tell you what m is.", 
    "You respond a equals\nF divided by m.", 
    "And you are done.", 
    "OK?", 
    "That was pretty simple.", 
    "It wasn&#39;t hard at all.", 
    "Now, why wasn&#39;t that hard?", 
    "It wasn&#39;t hard because, in\ntrying to figure out the", 
    "acceleration of the object,\nyou just asked me for the", 
    "mass, m, of the object.", 
    "You ignored a whole\nbunch of other", 
    "properties of the object.", 
    "You ignore its shape, its\ntemperature, its color, where", 
    "did I apply the force,\nhow it smelled, and", 
    "so on and so forth.", 
    "This kind of simplification\nwhere you took an object and", 
    "you assumed that the object\nhad a mass acting at that", 
    "point and the force was applied\nat that point is", 
    "called point-mass discretization\nor point-mass", 
    "simplification.", 
    "And by making the point-mass\nsimplification, you were able", 
    "to tremendously simplify how\nyou solved the problem.", 
    "And in doing so, you were able\nto get the acceleration very,", 
    "very quickly.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So with this little piece of\ninsight, let us go back to our", 
    "light bulb example and see how\nwe can find the current", 
    "through the light bulb through\nthe filament and by an", 
    "application of a\n[? voltage read ?]", 
    "and somehow take inspiration\nfrom the point-mass", 
    "discretization that\nwe did in physics.", 
    "So let&#39;s data the bulb\nfor a second here.", 
    "In this bulb, we really don&#39;t\ncare about exactly how the", 
    "current flows inside\nthe filament.", 
    "We don&#39;t care about its\ntemperature, its shape, its", 
    "orientation.", 
    "We just don&#39;t get about\na lot of things.", 
    "All I care about is what is the\ncurrent through the bulb.", 
    "So to do so, much like we did\nthe point-mass discretization,", 
    "what we&#39;re going to do is\nreplace the bulb with a", 
    "discrete resistor.", 
    "We will replace the bulb with\na discrete resistor for the", 
    "simple purpose of calculating\nthe current.", 
    "And using this very simple\nmodel, this very simple", 
    "simplification, I&#39;m not going\nto be able to tell you what", 
    "its temperature is or what its\nshape is and so on, but I will", 
    "be able to tell you what\nits current is.", 
    "So let&#39;s proceed with this\nsimplification and continue", 
    "down the easy path.", 
    "So as I said, we&#39;ll replace\nthe bulb with a discrete", 
    "resistor for the purpose of\ncomputing the current.", 
    "And so, let me draw\na little picture.", 
    "So here&#39;s my representation\nfor the battery.", 
    "And what I&#39;m going to do is here\nare my two points, A and", 
    "B, representing the two\nterminals of the bulb.", 
    "And I&#39;m going to replace the\nbulb and model it as a", 
    "resistor with resistance, R.\nThere&#39;s going to be some", 
    "voltage, V, across\nthe resistor.", 
    "And my goal, as I said earlier,\nwas to figure out the", 
    "current, I.", 
    "So what I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve\nreplaced the bulb here with a", 
    "resistor, where the resistor\nis serving as a", 
    "model for the bulb.", 
    "It&#39;s a discrete element\ncalled the resistor.", 
    "And by doing so, now I can\nvery quickly compute the", 
    "current through the bulb using\nOhm&#39;s Law, as the current, I,", 
    "is simply V divided by R.\nNow, wasn&#39;t that simple?", 
    "OK?", 
    "Show me where the differential\nequations are.", 
    "They&#39;re all gone.", 
    "By making an extremely simple\nmodel, by making the", 
    "simplification and replacing all\nof the properties of the", 
    "bulb with the simple resistor\nwith resistance, R, I was able", 
    "to compute the current, I.", 
    "Let me continue.", 
    "And in EE what we are going to\nbe doing is we&#39;re going to be", 
    "doing things the simple way.", 
    "And in this particular\nsituation, to find the", 
    "current, I, through the bulb,\nI replace the bulb with a", 
    "resistor with resistance, R. And\nI very quickly was able to", 
    "find the current.", 
    "So this is going to be a\nconstant, constant point that", 
    "we make in 6002X, which is that,\nin EECS, as engineers,", 
    "we do things the easy way.", 
    "In fact, this is true\nof all engineering.", 
    "Here in engineering, our goal\nis to build useful systems", 
    "that help humanity.", 
    "And our goal will be to try to\ndo it in the simplest manner", 
    "possible, unlike like science\nwhere, in science, you have to", 
    "learn what is.", 
    "But in engineering, we&#39;re going\nto take the easiest path", 
    "possible in order to build\nuseful systems and possibly", 
    "make as many simplifications as\nwe want, as long as we get", 
    "to our goal", 
    "So in this particular situation\nwith our resistance,", 
    "R, represents the only property\nof interest for us,", 
    "in terms of computing the\ncurrent, I, for the filament", 
    "of the bulb.", 
    "So this is very much like the\npoint-mass simplification", 
    "where we replaced placed objects\nwith their mass, m, in", 
    "order to find the acceleration,\na equals F", 
    "divided by m.", 
    "So I really hope that you see\nthis relationship between the", 
    "simplifications we made in\nphysics to the simplifications", 
    "we make in EECS.", 
    "And as we go on, I&#39;m going to\nshow you some really, really", 
    "extraordinary results that we\nget by making some of these", 
    "some simplifications.", 
    "So as I said, the R represents\nthe key property of interest", 
    "for the bulb and enables us\nto compute the current.", 
    "What R has done is that it\nrelates the voltage across the", 
    "resistor to its current.", 
    "So R relates the voltage\nand current", 
    "related to the element.", 
    "R relates the V and I of the\nelement to each other by the", 
    "expression I is given\nby V divided by R.", 
    "So this relation, I equals V\ndivided by R, is called the", 
    "element v-i relationship.", 
    "So obey these elements, and we\nwill define a v-i relationship", 
    "for those elements that&#39;s going\nto capture the voltage", 
    "and current relationships for\neach element that you will see", 
    "in this course.", 
    "So this lumped element, R, that\nwe&#39;ve created to replace", 
    "the bulb for the purpose of\ncomputing the current through", 
    "the bulb is a lumped element\nabstraction for the bulb.", 
    "You&#39;ve abstracted out all the\nproperties of the bulb into", 
    "this element, R, for the purpose\nof computing the", 
    "current through the bulb.", 
    "It&#39;s important for me to point\nout this word that you see", 
    "here, abstraction.", 
    "This is probably the single most\ncommon word that you will", 
    "hear in an EECS curriculum.", 
    "A large part of what we do in\nengineering is we build", 
    "abstractions.", 
    "We make things simple and\nrepresent them with some", 
    "abstract properties.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Many of you have probably done\ncomputer programming.", 
    "And in computer programming, you\nare very used to writing", 
    "programs with a set\nof lines of code.", 
    "And what you might do is if you\nhave a function, f, with", 
    "some arguments, then you might\nreplace the properties and the", 
    "actions of a bunch of lines\nof code with this abstract", 
    "function, f.", 
    "So that&#39;s another example of\nabstraction where f replaces a", 
    "set of lines of code that will\nperform the same function.", 
    "So it&#39;s so much easier\nto use f.", 
    null, 
    "f can replace a set\nof lines of code.", 
    "The same manner, our element, R,\nwill replace a large set of", 
    "differential equations and\nproperties that would", 
    "characterize the bulb.", 
    "So you will see this concept of\nabstraction again and again", 
    "and again in all of electrical\nengineering and computer", 
    "science as you do more and more\ncourses in this area.", 
    "And if there&#39;s one word that\ndescribes our entire field of", 
    "EECS, it is this word\nabstraction.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Enough on abstraction.", 
    "As you can see, I love the\nconcept of abstraction.", 
    "And let&#39;s pretty quickly\nsummarize what", 
    "we&#39;ve seen so far.", 
    "We build lumped elements.", 
    "And lumped elements are", 
    "characterized by their vi relation.", 
    "So for example, I could\nhave a lumped element", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "And I can define a voltage\nacross a lumped element.", 
    "And I can define a current\nthrough the lumped element.", 
    "And in this case, when I define\nthe voltage and the", 
    "current going in through the\npositive terminal of the", 
    "element, the power consumed by\nthe element is given by the i.", 
    "So remember this.", 
    "You will see this again and\nagain as well that I take an", 
    "element, and I define a\nvoltage, v, across the", 
    "element, and I define a current\ngoing in to the", 
    "positive terminal\nof the element.", 
    "And in that case, the power\nconsumed by the element is", 
    "going to be vi.", 
    "I want you to be careful\nwhenever you define power as", 
    "whether the power was consumed\nby the element or power is", 
    "supplied by the element OK?", 
    "In this case, the power consumed\nby the element is vi.", 
    "So to continue with the\nresistor, my resistor is a", 
    "lumped element.", 
    "And I can describe it with a\nvoltage, v, and a current, i.", 
    "And I can also plot\nthe values.", 
    "So for the resistor, the vi\nrelation is given by i equals", 
    "V divided by R, where\nR is the resistance", 
    "property of this resistor.", 
    "So this element is characterized\nby its iv", 
    "relation. i equals\nV divided R.", 
    "One interesting computation you\ncan make is, how do you", 
    "plot this element relationship\non an iv curve?", 
    "Then I show you a pair\nof axes here.", 
    "So let me pause for a couple\nof seconds while you think", 
    "about what this relationship\nmight look like.",
