    "ANANT AGARWAL: Let's get started with doing our usual", 
    "analysis, using the op amp model.", 
    "Let's go ahead and analyze the same inverting amplifier", 
    "circuit topology.", 
    "But this time, let's provide the feedback into the positive", 
    "terminal, like so.", 
    "OK, let me repeat that in this topology, notice in the", 
    "sequence, for whatever reason--", 
    "OK, yeah, blame me for it--", 
    "I have picked R2 to be the feedback resistor and R1 to be", 
    "the resistor coming in.", 
    "And I believe, in some of our earlier exercises and videos,", 
    "we have picked R1 in the feedback path", 
    "and R2 at the input.", 
    "So just be cautious.", 
    "The output of the function of the input will--", 
    "just be careful when you label R2 and R1, OK?", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "So here, I have V-in, like this.", 
    "And what I'm going to do now is I am going to replace the", 
    "op amp with its usual circuit model that you've seen so far,", 
    "which is, I have two inputs, V-plus and V-minus.", 
    "And I have a dependent source.", 
    "This is my dependent source here, with a gain A, A times", 
    "the difference between V-plus and V-minus.", 
    "And this is where I have V-out, taken", 
    "with respect to ground.", 
    "And now let me go ahead and make my connections.", 
    "So notice that I have connected to V-plus terminal.", 
    "I have a resistance R2 connected to it.", 
    "So that is R2.", 
    "And then I have an R1 connected to the V-plus", 
    "terminal, like this.", 
    "And here is my input V-in.", 
    "Let me just check to make sure I have all the connections.", 
    "Ah, I missed the ground connection.", 
    "Circuits 101, don't forget the ground.", 
    "Always make the ground connection.", 
    "You need a return path for the current.", 
    "Circuits are built in loops.", 
    "The currents go in loops.", 
    "And so you always have to make sure you", 
    "get the ground connected.", 
    "OK, so this is the circuit that I want to analyze.", 
    "And so what I'd like you to do is you should be able to", 
    "analyze this yourself.", 
    "Now, this is just a circuit.", 
    "This is not an op amp.", 
    "This is a straight circuit, where I have some dependent", 
    "source, and I have a pair of resistors, R2 and R1, and an", 
    "input voltage.", 
    "So you should be able to analyze this and tell me what", 
    "V-out is as a function of V. So let's get you to do a", 
    "little exercise.", 
    "And then we will come back, and I will try to solve this.", 
    "So let me go ahead and say that for you.", 
    "Find V-out as a function of V-in.", 
    "You will see that V-out will be equal to minus R2 over R1", 
    "times V-in, which is the same thing as", 
    "you would have gotten--", 
    "I'll put this in quotes, and I'll explain why later--", 
    "it is the same thing that we got with the", 
    "negative feedback circuit.", 
    "So go right ahead and try this out for yourselves."
