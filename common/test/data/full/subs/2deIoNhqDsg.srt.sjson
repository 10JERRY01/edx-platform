    "To do well in the course, you\nmust have a advanced placement", 
    "or AP-level understanding\nof electricity and", 
    "magnetism in physics.", 
    "And these are at the level of\nMIT 8.02 course, which you", 
    "might check out on MIT\nOpenCourseWare.", 
    "It&#39;s also useful for you to\nhave a basic knowledge of", 
    "solving simple differential\nequations.", 
    "Now, they will cover how to\nsolve some simple equations in", 
    "this course.",
