    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so let's get on with it.", 
    "I've just summarized what we've seen so far.", 
    "Notice here, I have it written down more clearly.", 
    "The boundaries of the saturation region at the low", 
    "value of VI for VI equals VT.", 
    "And now my goal is to find out what this point is.", 
    "How do I go about doing that?", 
    "So at that point, notice that two", 
    "equations must be satisfied.", 
    "One is the equation", 
    "corresponding to the load line.", 
    "Let me write that down.", 
    "So the equation corresponding to the load line is simply IDS", 
    "equals VS divided by RL minus v0 divided by RL.", 
    "So recall, this was the little expression I had given by B. I", 
    "used to call this A.", 
    "So this is none other than B here.", 
    "What are the other equations that I can use", 
    "to find this point?", 
    "So notice that this point must also satisfy this equation.", 
    "This point is on the IDS equals K divided by 2 times V0", 
    "squared curve.", 
    "So let me write that down as well.", 
    "So at that point, I know that IDS is equal to K divided by", 
    "2, V0 squared.", 
    "So if I equate both these sides, I can", 
    "go ahead and solve.", 
    "So therefore, from those two, I can write K divided by 2, V0", 
    "squared is equal to VS divided by RL minus V0 divided by RL.", 
    "So right there, I have a quadratic equation in V0. and", 
    "I can go and solve it.", 
    "You can solve it using the usual quadratic method.", 
    "And I can directly write down the solution for you.", 
    "So my V0 will be minus B. So let me just go ahead and write", 
    "that down in the more usual form that you're all familiar", 
    "with, K divided by 2, V0 squared, plus V0 divided by", 
    "RL, minus VS divided by RL equals 0.", 
    "So the quadratic formula is minus B, which is the", 
    "coefficient of V0 here.", 
    "So minus B, the coefficient of that, is simply given by 1", 
    "divided RL.", 
    "But what I'm going to do is, to simplify things a little", 
    "bit, I think I'll go ahead and multiply both sides by RL to", 
    "make it a little simpler.", 
    "And so I'm going to get KRL divided by 2, V0 squared plus", 
    "V0 minus VS equals 0.", 
    "So in this case, my B becomes 1 in the", 
    "usual quadratic formula.", 
    "And so I get minus B, which is minus 1.", 
    "And in general, I get two roots.", 
    "So it is a plus or minus square root of B", 
    "squared minus 4AC.", 
    "So this coefficient is A, this coefficient is B, and this", 
    "coefficient is C. I'm sorry, this constant is C. That's", 
    "minus VS. B is 1, and A is KRL divided by 2.", 
    "So the general formula is minus 1 plus or minus square", 
    "root of B squared minus 4AC, the whole thing divided by 2A.", 
    "And in this particular situation, as in all", 
    "situations, I get two roots with plus or minus.", 
    "Clearly, the minus root does not apply, because by looking", 
    "at the circuit here, notice that I have a ground node and", 
    "I have a VS, and I know that my current is slowing down.", 
    "And so, therefore, this must be a positive voltage, given", 
    "that my MOSFET here is not going to be", 
    "supplying power by itself.", 
    "And so, therefore, this must be a positive voltage.", 
    "And so, therefore, I'm going to take the positive root.", 
    "So I get a plus, and I'll get B squared minus 4AC.", 
    "B is 1, so I get 1 here.", 
    "4AC is simply 4 times KRL divided by 2, which is 2KRL,", 
    "and times VS, so it's 2KRLVS. And I get a minus, so minus a", 
    "minus is a plus.", 
    "So I get plus 2KRLVS, and the whole thing divided by twice", 
    "A.", 
    "So twice A is KRL.", 
    "There you have it.", 
    "So just to summarize very quickly, what we have here is", 
    "the second step of large signal analysis.", 
    "And this was one set of boundary points.", 
    "And we just have found the second set of boundary points,", 
    "where the second set of boundary points is given by", 
    "this point here.", 
    "And what I've done so far is found out V0 for that point.", 
    "And the way I did that was I said, this point for the", 
    "intersection of the load line and the triode region", 
    "boundary, and I solved those two equations, and I found V0.", 
    "As my next step, let me go ahead and find VI and IDS.", 
    "Once I've done that, I will have finished my", 
    "large signal analysis.", 
    "Let's go ahead and continue to find VI and IDS.", 
    "So writing it a little more cleanly, this is VS from the", 
    "previous slide.", 
    "I'm sorry, V0.", 
    "So this is my point, V0.", 
    "So this is V0 here.", 
    "So this value, V0, is this point here on the V0-axis.", 
    "Now, what is VI?", 
    "What is the limit of VI?", 
    "The limit of VI is pretty straightforward.", 
    "Notice that if V0 is here, my constraint is given by this", 
    "expression here.", 
    "My constraint is given by V0 greater than or", 
    "equal to VI minus VT.", 
    "So at this boundary point, what I just enter into the", 
    "triode region, which is what this constraint relates to.", 
    "So when V0 greater than VI minus VT, I'm on the", 
    "right-hand side.", 
    "So when V0 equals VI minus VT, I am on this line.", 
    "So therefore, I get VI, at that point, is simply VI is", 
    "given by V0 plus VT.", 
    "So if I take the V0 at that boundary and add VT to it, I'm", 
    "going to get my VI constraint.", 
    "So let me go ahead and do that.", 
    "So the VI is simply VT plus this thingamajig here, so", 
    "simply VT plus the boundary value of V0.", 
    "So let me go ahead and find IDS next.", 
    "How do I do that?", 
    "Well, IDS is pretty straightforward.", 
    "I can go ahead and find IDS using any one", 
    "of a number of methods.", 
    "But just look at this equation here, and I can simply write,", 
    "IDS is VS divided by RL, plus V0 divided by RL.", 
    "My V0, again, is given by this expression here.", 
    "So this is V0, and I have V0 again here.", 
    "So once I computer V0, the other two values are", 
    "very easy to get.", 
    "So I take this value and I substitute that for V0 here.", 
    "And I could very quickly find the value of IDS.", 
    "That completes my large signal analysis, which again involved", 
    "finding the boundary values for my", 
    "saturation region of operation.", 
    "So what is this really, really telling us?", 
    "What this is really telling us is that, for our MOSFET", 
    "amplifier, it's saying that, look, I should not be", 
    "operating the MOSFET at values of VI that are greater than", 
    "this value.", 
    "If I operated the MOSFET at values of VI that are greater,", 
    "then I'm going to find that my MOSFET characteristics are", 
    "going to trail into the triode region.", 
    "So therefore, I would need to operate my circuit at a value", 
    "of VI that is less than VT plus V0.", 
    "Similarly, for this point here, my VI has to be greater", 
    "than VT, and that's my second boundary point.", 
    "So I can summarize all of this information and wrap up large", 
    "signal analysis for my MOSFET amplifier, which I will draw", 
    "again here.", 
    "Drain source gate VI, V0, RL, VS, and this is IDS.", 
    "So recall, large signal analysis for the MOSFET said,", 
    "you need to find V0 versus VI first. And I did that.", 
    "And I found V0 to be given by VS minus K divided by 2, VI", 
    "minus VT, all squared, times RL.", 
    "That was my V0 versus VI transfer characteristic.", 
    "And the second point was, I needed to find the valid", 
    "operating ranges under the saturation discipline.", 
    "So there's clearly several operating ranges.", 
    "There's a valid input range, and there's a corresponding", 
    "output range.", 
    "And I could also do the range for IDS.", 
    "You saw that on the previous slide.", 
    "So what are my valid output ranges here?", 
    "Let me write that down first. So my valid output ranges are,", 
    "V0 ranges from VS at the upper end.", 
    "So you recall I had a characteristic that looked", 
    "like this, where this was VS, this is the V0-axis, this is", 
    "the VI-axis.", 
    "And at this point, I had VI equals VT.", 
    "And so my output, V0, ranged from VS here, and then went", 
    "all the way down to the solution to the quadratic that", 
    "we did earlier, which was minus 1 plus 1 plus 2KRLVS,", 
    "the whole thing divided by KRL.", 
    "So that was the range for VS.", 
    "And we said that the corresponding ranges for VI", 
    "was very straightforward.", 
    "We simply went ahead and added a value of VT", 
    "to the output range.", 
    "So in this case, if this was my valid output range, then I", 
    "said I was just going to add VT at the upper end of the", 
    "range to that value.", 
    "And then at the lower end of the range, of course my VI had", 
    "to be greater than VT.", 
    "So there's my range.", 
    "So VI would range from VT to VT plus, this expression here.", 
    "And then VO ranges from VS down to this expression here.", 
    "And you can compute the value of IDS from the expression I", 
    "showed you earlier, where IDS was computed straightforwardly", 
    "by using VS divided by RL minus V0 divided by RL.", 
    "So you can simply substitute those values for VS, RL, and", 
    "V0, and you would get the ranges for VDS.", 
    "So this is a quick summary of our large signal analysis,", 
    "which has the two components to it.", 
    "Finally, let me just quickly note that there's a different", 
    "way by which we can get the same parameters, the same way", 
    "that we can executive a large signal analysis.", 
    "And I'm going to do that next.", 
    "It's just a different way of looking at things.", 
    "It just gives you a different perspective.", 
    "So let's go ahead and try that out."
