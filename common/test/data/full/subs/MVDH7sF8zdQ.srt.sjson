    "SPEAKER 1: OK, so next let me\nmove on to how I implement a", 
    "trick like this using the kind\nof circuits ideas that we have", 
    "talked about.", 
    "So just to refresh your memory\nagain, this is my I-V curve", 
    "and focused on the\nsmall segment.", 
    "And this small segment is as an\noffset capital V capital D", 
    "capital I capital D\nfrom the origin.", 
    "And then what I did is that I\napplied my input voltage here,", 
    "a small input voltage, that\nI call small v small d.", 
    "And that&#39;s a small v small i.", 
    "And by doing so, I was able to\nget a linear response in ID.", 
    "And let me mark that here.", 
    "And this would be my\nsmall i small d.", 
    "And that would look something\nlike this.", 
    "OK, I&#39;ve got a small sinusoid\nout there for id corresponding", 
    "to the meandering of small v\nsmall d, vd, about the point", 
    "capital VD and capital ID.", 
    "And again, VD, this is the\nsame as capital VI.", 
    "I&#39;m just using VD and\nVI equivalently.", 
    "So let&#39;s go ahead and implement\nthis in circuits.", 
    "So here&#39;s the key again.", 
    "The idea is to boost\nand shrink.", 
    "I have shrunk my signal of\ninterest. VI was my signal of", 
    "interest. I&#39;ve shrunk\nit to a small value.", 
    "If it&#39;s a big sinusoid, I&#39;ve\nshrunk it to a small value.", 
    "And then I&#39;ve added a DC offset\nto it that I call", 
    "capital V capital I. And\ntogether by boosting it and", 
    "shrinking it, I manage to\narticulate or manage to make", 
    "the signal expose that small\npiece of the segment of the", 
    "I-V characteristic of the\nnonlinear device.", 
    "So let me go ahead and implement\nthis boosting and", 
    "shrinking business.", 
    "How do I do that?", 
    "So let&#39;s take a look at\nthe circuit up here.", 
    "And this circuit has my\nnonlinear device the LED.", 
    "Let me just mark\nthat as before.", 
    "That doesn&#39;t change.", 
    "This in my nonlinear device.", 
    "And this is my circuit.", 
    "And in this particular circuit,\nthis continues as my", 
    "ground node.", 
    "This is vD.", 
    "So where previously I had an\ninput VI, what I&#39;m going to do", 
    "is the following.", 
    "So notice that up there\nI had an input VI.", 
    "And that input was connected to\nthe circuit and that gives", 
    "rise to a nonlinear response.", 
    "So what I&#39;m going to do\nnow is the following.", 
    "Now I&#39;m going to change\nthis and break", 
    "it up into two parts.", 
    "I&#39;m going to break it up into\na DC value capital VI and a", 
    "small signal small vi and in\nthis case it&#39;s time varying.", 
    "It&#39;s a music signal that\nI want a transmit", 
    "so it&#39;s vi of t.", 
    "So in a circuit sense, the way I\ncan do this is I can apply a", 
    "DC source here.", 
    "And by applying a DC source,\nthat gives rise to the", 
    "boosting of the signal to the\npoint that I care about.", 
    "And then I&#39;m going to put\nanother sources in series here", 
    "with it and that\nis my small vi.", 
    "So small vi is a small AC source\nin series with a large", 
    "DC VI source.", 
    "So if I were to draw it, this is\nmy time axis and then this", 
    "is some DC value here.", 
    "This is VI, this\nis a DC value.", 
    "And then for my small signal\nvalue, this is 0, this is 0.", 
    "My small signal value, small\nvi, that&#39;s something that", 
    "looks like this.", 
    "So I&#39;ve taken a small signal vi\nand put that in series with", 
    "a large signal VI DC value,\ncapital V capital I, and put", 
    "it in the circuit.", 
    "So what I&#39;ve shown you here is\nexactly the circuit equivalent", 
    "of this boost and shrink\nbusiness that I talked about.", 
    "Now what happens on\nthe LED side?", 
    "Notice I had a vD, which was\nmy signal out there.", 
    "And there&#39;s an iD as well.", 
    "Now I claim that the following\nis true and we will look at", 
    "this in a lot more\ndetail later.", 
    "Notice that vD, which is a\ntotal signal, is given by", 
    "really a capital VD plus a\nsmall vd by construction.", 
    "I made that construction.", 
    "And so this is the same as vI\nbeing equal to capital V", 
    "capital I plus small vi.", 
    "That was my construction.", 
    "These were the same voltages.", 
    "Now I claim that the current\nid with also look similar.", 
    "The current id will have a DC\nvalue ID plus a small signal", 
    "value small i small d that will\ncorrespond to the capital", 
    "VI and small vi applied\nat the input.", 
    "Now graphically that\nmakes sense.", 
    "If you go back to this graph on\nthe left-hand side, notice", 
    "that there is a DC offset\nID, which is a DC value", 
    "corresponding to VD.", 
    "And then that is a small\nid about that point.", 
    "So graphically you can see that\nand I&#39;m going to mark", 
    "that down here.", 
    "We can look at that\nmathematically as well.", 
    "So this is how I implement\nthis trick.", 
    "This is how I implement this\ntrick of boost and shrink.", 
    "Just remember boost and shrink,\nyou add a DC value and", 
    "then you shrink the input.", 
    "OK, so if you do something like\nthis, what do you get?", 
    "So the result is\nthe following.", 
    "The result is, if I plot things\na little bit more", 
    "carefully here, then\nthis is what I get.", 
    "First of all, let me draw\nout capital VD,", 
    "which is my DC offset.", 
    "And then I have a small signal\ninput about the DC offset.", 
    "And so that is going to look\nsomething like this.", 
    "That&#39;s a DC value.", 
    "And notice that about the\nDC offset I get a", 
    "small vd out there.", 
    "And then notice that at any\ngiven point in time, my total", 
    "signal is small v capital D,\nwhich is a sum of capital V", 
    "capital D plus small vd.", 
    "So notice the signal.", 
    "VD is my DC offset and then\nabout that point I have a", 
    "small vd, and together they sum\nup to the total signal of", 
    "vD at any given point in time.", 
    "So this is my time axis.", 
    "The current behaves in a\ncorresponding manner and I get", 
    "something like this.", 
    "This is my ID.", 
    "So let me mark that down.", 
    "That&#39;s my DC offset at\nthe current output.", 
    "And then I get some ID about\nthat DC point and that current", 
    "is going to look like this.", 
    "And that current also has a\nsmall value small i small d.", 
    "And then this is my total signal\ni capital D, where i", 
    "capital D is the DC value plus\nthe small signal value.", 
    "So my input is [? VI ?]", 
    "and my current response is ID.", 
    "And in this case, the output\nsinusoid, my current sinusoid,", 
    "is amazingly enough more\nor less linear.", 
    "That is absolutely spectacularly\namazing, where I", 
    "take a nonlinear circuit, focus\non a small region of the", 
    "transfer curve of the nonlinear\ncircuit, and then", 
    "boost my input signal so that it\nmeanders about that point,", 
    "then what I will find is that my\noutput is going to be more", 
    "or less linear.", 
    "This is an absolutely\namazing trick.", 
    "So what I&#39;ve covered so far is\nreally a very, very clever and", 
    "a disciplined way of using a\ncircuit so that they can get", 
    "more or less linear behavior\nout of a nonlinear circuit.", 
    "Really what I have done is\nI&#39;ve said, look, I have a", 
    "nonlinear circuit, right?", 
    "We are engineers.", 
    "We can use the nonlinear circuit\nin any that we want.", 
    "And I have this LED device that\nhas some very interesting", 
    "properties.",

    "response to a voltage\napplied across it.", 
    "It&#39;s a very interesting\nproperty, but", 
    "it&#39;s a nonlinear device.", 
    "So how do I use it?", 
    "Well, what I can do is by\nimposing this discipline on", 
    "myself, if you want you can\ncall it a small signal", 
    "discipline, where I&#39;m going\nto boost the signals to", 
    "interesting portions of the\ncircuit and then shrink them", 
    "so they&#39;re very small.", 
    "Then in that discipline use, I\ncan get a more or less linear", 
    "response out of this\nnonlinear circuit.", 
    "So this really, really clever\nand disciplined way enables me", 
    "to get a linear response.",

    "This is one of those moments\nwhere you&#39;ve just seen how you", 
    "can take a nonlinear circuit\nand by focusing on a small", 
    "region of operation, you can\nget a more or less linear", 
    "response from that circuit.", 
    "This is absolutely amazing.", 
    "Virtually every device that we\nhave, the sound amplifiers in", 
    "our cell phone, the wireless\noutput amplifiers and signal", 
    "amplifiers and so on in your\nsmartphones, all kinds of", 
    "music production and video\noutput devices, all of them", 
    "are generally nonlinear and\nthe small signal trick is", 
    "really what is used to make\nall of these interesting", 
    "devices behave in a linear\nmanner so that I don&#39;t get a", 
    "lot of distortion in how\nI output things.", 
    "So to really convince you, I&#39;m\ngoing to do a little demo and", 
    "show you using sinusoids how\nthese circuits can really give", 
    "you linear behavior as I boost\nand shrink my input.", 
    "OK, so let&#39;s do a little demo\nand see what we find.",
