    "SPEAKER 1: OK.", 
    "I hope you had a chance to solve this for yourselves.", 
    "So recall what I'm trying to do here is try to figure out,", 
    "in the interval T1, what is the energy", 
    "supplied by the source?", 
    "And that is given by the integral 0 to T1 of VS i dt,", 
    "where i is the current being supplied by the source.", 
    "Also recall what the current was.", 
    "The current was simply this.", 
    "As a function of time, i was given by, as we derived", 
    "earlier, VS over R1, and VS over R1 e raised to minus t", 
    "over the time constant R1 C. OK, that's i.", 
    "So let's go ahead and substitute that in here.", 
    "So if I substitute in for i, i is VS over R1 e raised to", 
    "minus t over R1 C.", 
    "So I have VS multiplying i, OK?", 
    "So I get one VS here and the second VS in i, so I end up", 
    "getting integral 0 to T1 and VS squared divided by R1 e", 
    "raised to minus t over R1 C dt.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So how did I get VS squared divided by R1?", 
    "Well, I picked up one VS from here, and i was VS over R1,", 
    "and so therefore I multiply VS times VS over R1, I get VS", 
    "squared over R1.", 
    "And I get my e raised to minus t over R1 C from the current.", 
    "So I can go ahead and directly integrate this.", 
    "And what do I get?", 
    "If I go ahead and integrate this, let's", 
    "see, what do I get?", 
    "I get--", 
    "VS squared divided by R1 comes out, it's a constant, so I can", 
    "just bring that out.", 
    "And if I integrate e raised to minus t over R1 C dt, I get a", 
    "minus sign outside, I get R1 C e raised to minus t over R1 C", 
    "evaluated from to 0 to T1.", 
    "So I can go ahead and complete that for you.", 
    "So I start off with--", 
    "since I have a negative sign here, let me go with the 0", 
    "first, and then cancel out the negative.", 
    "So if I substitute 0 in place of t, I get--", 
    "oh, R1 and R1 one cancel out.", 
    "So I get C VS squared.", 
    "So I get C VS squared.", 
    "OK?", 
    "Then I substitute in T1 in place of t.", 
    "So I get C VS squared e raised to minus t over R1 C. I can", 
    "simplify that a little bit.", 
    "C VS squared times 1 minus e raised to minus T1 divided by", 
    "R1 C. That's what I get.", 
    "So now, if I stare at this for a quick second, let's assume", 
    "that the interval T1 is big enough, is long enough that my", 
    "capacitor fully charges up to its final value.", 
    "Technically, that will take forever.", 
    "But let's say T1 is much bigger than R1 C. So if T1 is", 
    "much, much greater than R1 C, much, much greater than the", 
    "time constant, then the capacitor pretty much gets to", 
    "its final value.", 
    "If we wait long enough, the capacitor pretty much gets to", 
    "its final value.", 
    "And for T1 being much greater than R1 C, I can neglect this", 
    "in comparison with the 1.", 
    "And so therefore e becomes more or less", 
    "equal to C VS squared.", 
    "Pretty simple.", 
    "So if you look at e being equal to C VS squared, think", 
    "about what it means.", 
    "So what we're really saying here is C VS squared is the", 
    "energy supplied by the source, total energy supplied by the", 
    "source in T1.", 
    "So that energy must have gone someplace.", 
    "That's the total energy supplied by the source.", 
    "And if you look up to the right hand side here, I have", 
    "this capacitor and I have a resistor.", 
    "Since T1 is very large, I'm going to end up with VS across", 
    "the capacitor.", 
    "If I have VS across the capacitor, I'm going to have", 
    "some energy stored in the capacitor, and that energy is", 
    "1/2 C VS squared.", 
    "So the total energy supplied by the source, C VS squared,", 
    "one part of it is stored on the capacitor, which is 1/2 C", 
    "VS squared stored on capacitor.", 
    "So at the end of T1, the capacitor is charged up almost", 
    "to VS, and so the energy stored in the capacitor is 1/2", 
    "C VS squared.", 
    "OK, so that's half the energy.", 
    "So the source supplied C VS squared, and half of that is", 
    "in the capacitor.", 
    "Where did the other half go?", 
    "Clearly, it can't have vanished.", 
    "It must have gone someplace.", 
    "Well, since the capacitor is being charged through a", 
    "resistor, the other half of the energy must have", 
    "dissipated in R1.", 
    "So the other half must have dissipated in R1.", 
    "By the way, you can calculate that from first principles.", 
    "You can look at the current i or multiply that by R and", 
    "integrate over T1, you will still get 1/2 C VS squared as", 
    "the energy dissipated in R. So 1/2 C VS squared was further", 
    "dissipated in R1.", 
    "So since that energy is dissipated, why don't I call", 
    "that energy E1.", 
    "So E1 is the energy dissipated in R1.", 
    "The energy stored in the capacitor is stored, it's not", 
    "dissipated, so it's stored and can be supplied for later use.", 
    "So therefore, I'm not going to count that energy on the", 
    "capacitor as being dissipated.", 
    "OK, so as a recap, the source supply C VS squared, half is", 
    "stored in the capacitor, 1/2 C VS squared.", 
    "It's not dissipated, it's stored in the capacitor.", 
    "I could use it later.", 
    "But half of it, 1/2 C VS squared is dissipated in the", 
    "resistor R1.", 
    "What is interesting here, what is really interesting here, is", 
    "notice that when time T1 is large enough, that these two", 
    "energies, the energy supplied by the source, the energy", 
    "dissipated in the resistor, or for that matter, the energy", 
    "stored in the capacitor are independent of R.", 
    "They are independent of the resistance R1.", 
    "That's pretty interesting.", 
    "So keep that insight in mind.", 
    "We will get back to this after we have looked at what happens", 
    "in the interval T2.", 
    "As a quick recap, I really have burned up 1/2 C VS", 
    "squared energy, and I call that E1.", 
    "That's my energy, E1.", 
    "I will pick that up again.", 
    "And once I've computed the energy dissipated in the", 
    "second cycle, T2, and then from there add them all up."
