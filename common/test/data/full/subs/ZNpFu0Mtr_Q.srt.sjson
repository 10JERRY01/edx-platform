    "SPEAKER 1: This sequence will pull together a lot of what", 
    "you have learned throughout this course.", 
    "And look at it from the energy and power standpoint.", 
    "Energy is extremely important.", 
    "And the little cartoon shows energy relates to a lot of", 
    "what we do in daily life, OK?", 
    "So for example, if you have devices like your handheld, or", 
    "your laptop, and other such stuff, energy relates to how", 
    "long the battery will last in your cellphone.", 
    "How long the battery will last in your laptop.", 
    "The battery life relates to two things.", 
    "One is, you've seen in cellphone usage when you look", 
    "at the specs of you cellphone, it talks about how long the", 
    "phone the last in standby mode.", 
    "That means when you're not actively talking on your", 
    "phone, if you just leave the phone on but you don't use it,", 
    "how long will it last?", 
    "How long will the battery last?", 
    "That's called standby mode.", 
    "In this sequence we will look at what standby mode means.", 
    "And why does standby mode give you more battery life than", 
    "when you have the cellphone in active use?", 
    "When you're actively talking on it, actively using it, OK?", 
    "We'll look at these two things.", 
    "Another aspect of energy and power is when they chips,", 
    "oftentimes we don't care so much about battery life, but", 
    "simply if the chip is consuming too much power, OK?", 
    "Let's say for example, if I build a network router, and", 
    "the router is plugged into a power supply, I will not care", 
    "as much about battery life because", 
    "there's no battery here.", 
    "I still worry about power consumption, but here I might", 
    "simply worry about how much power is being", 
    "consumed by the chip.", 
    "And the chip produces heat.", 
    "If it's consuming too much power, the chip might burn up", 
    "and self destruct, OK?", 
    "So having low power in chips, even when things are plugged", 
    "in, is a good idea.", 
    "Finally, a really important point is that we really need", 
    "to reduce our energy consumption.", 
    "And electronics, whether it's servers, cloud systems, or", 
    "data centers are consuming a huge amount of", 
    "power today, OK?", 
    "As a quick little statistic, did you know, well, energy", 
    "consumed by data centers in the United States is as much", 
    "as the entire state of Utah.", 
    "That's a lot of energy.", 
    "Do the following experiment.", 
    "Buy an energy meter, a power meter, and check how much", 
    "power is being used up by your printer, or your", 
    "computer, and so on.", 
    "Even when the printer is not in use, if the printer is", 
    "plugged in and turned on, the printer maybe burning anywhere", 
    "from 50, 60, 70, even 100 watts.", 
    "It's as if you have a 70 or 80 watt light bulb constantly on", 
    "all the time for each printer, OK?", 
    "Many homes have many printers, or many computers, and so on.", 
    "So just imagine if all of these are left on.", 
    "So dealing with energy, trying to make all our devices more", 
    "energy efficient is a good thing.", 
    "In this sequence we will learn about how we can calculate the", 
    "amount of energy and power consumed by the kind of", 
    "circuits we've been building.", 
    "And then look at ways in which we can reduce the power", 
    "substantially."
