    "SPEAKER: In the previous sequence, we learned about", 
    "systems that were made out of, say, a", 
    "capacitor and an inductor.", 
    "And these were perfect capacitor and inductor with no", 
    "other parameters or resistance or anything like that, which", 
    "is equivalent to a perfect pendulum in the sense that", 
    "there's no dissipation of the energy that's", 
    "stored in the pendulum.", 
    "It just oscillates forever.", 
    "And you'll see in this case, or we have seen, is uniform", 
    "oscillation of a frequency which is determined by the", 
    "inductance of the capacitance.", 
    "That's how such a circuit will behave.", 
    "However, that's not very realistic for most real", 
    "systems. They have some amount of resistance in them.", 
    "And if there is resistance, then just as with air", 
    "resistance of the pendulum, the oscillation", 
    "will decay with time.", 
    "It'll look like this.", 
    "The oscillation will just get smaller and smaller and go on", 
    "for a long period of time.", 
    "Indeed, it will be characterized by two numbers.", 
    "One is the oscillation frequency, which", 
    "we'll call omega d.", 
    "And the other is the rate at which it decays, which is", 
    "called alpha.", 
    "So we'll end up with something that looks like e to the minus", 
    "alpha t times cosine omega dt plus phi, where phi is some", 
    "phase factor, which is dependant upon the initial", 
    "conditions.", 
    "And the amplitude of the overall amplitude will be", 
    "something like that, too, from the initial conditions.", 
    "So this is going to say how fast things die out.", 
    "And this says how fast things go.", 
    "Now the exciting thing here is that almost everything like", 
    "this has a particular kind of differential equation.", 
    "L:et's call it d square x dt square plus 2 aplha dx dt plus", 
    "omega zero square x equals some random drive terms, which", 
    "I don't even care about.", 
    "This is sort of the general characteristic.", 
    "This alpha is this alpha.", 
    "And this omega zero is not that omega d.", 
    "But they're related.", 
    "If alpha were 0, this differential equation with", 
    "just these two terms is the differential equation of the", 
    "LC network without the R. And so this omega zero would then", 
    "be the actual frequency of this oscillation", 
    "but not this one.", 
    "We're also going to introduce a factor called Q, which is", 
    "omega zero over 2 alpha.", 
    "And that's going to be a measure of how fast energy is", 
    "lost in the system due to the resistance.", 
    "What happens is that there's an amount of energy stored at", 
    "the beginning of every cycle.", 
    "And some of that energy is lost by current going through", 
    "the resistance.", 
    "And so the ratio of the energy stored to the energy lost is", 
    "going to be something like this Q. In fact, what ends up", 
    "happening is that the Q is the number of cycles it takes for,", 
    "say, something like the voltage to decay from some", 
    "value like this to, say--", 
    "it's the number of cycles it takes to decay to a value", 
    "which is e to the minus pi times the original value of 1", 
    "over e to the pi, a weird number, but very interesting.", 
    "The power will, of course, go as 1 over e to the 2 pi.", 
    "So there we go.", 
    "That's what we're going to be learning about.", 
    "We're going to be learning about the ways in", 
    "which things decay.", 
    "And, of course, if you want to make an oscillator that goes", 
    "forever, you got to figure out some way to pump energy back", 
    "into this system.", 
    "And we'll learn about that even later."
