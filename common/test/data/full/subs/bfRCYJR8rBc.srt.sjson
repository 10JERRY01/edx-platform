    "SPEAKER 1: So in lecture, you just saw an inductor, which is", 
    "the dual of a capacitor.", 
    "They're in some ways very similar components, some ways", 
    "very different.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: A capacitor is a thing", 
    "that remembers a voltage.", 
    "That is, it's hard to change the voltage across it.", 
    "You have put a current into it, and the current is then", 
    "the derivative of the voltage.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And an inductor remembers current.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Right.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So it's basically the same sort of thing, only", 
    "it remembers current instead of voltage, but you use them", 
    "very differently.", 
    "They're very different physically.", 
    "And I think the next type of lectures are going to kind of", 
    "alternate between theory and practice.", 
    "So this one was a theory lecture.", 
    "The next one will be a practice lecture where you", 
    "will see applications of these components in different areas,", 
    "places like digital memory where, as we've said many", 
    "times, just remember things, and you can actually sort", 
    "charge on a capacitor.", 
    "For example, put some charge on, maybe put a MOS switch", 
    "over here, turn that switch on, put some charge on, open", 
    "out that switch, and then it'll charge for a little", 
    "while and sometimes recharge it.", 
    "And you'll see a couple of other applications.", 
    "You'll see how to use this theory I think that'll come up", 
    "the following week to see the speed of digital circuits.", 
    "But at the same time, the really key application that--", 
    "or sorry, the really key bit of theory that you'll see is", 
    "superposition.", 
    "And we're both going to talk a lot about this.", 
    "But superposition was something you saw early in the", 
    "course, and now it really kicks into overdrive.", 
    "Because early in the course, you just saw it analyze simple", 
    "circuits [? as mobile ?] sources.", 
    "Now that we have memory, we can use it to analyze", 
    "signals over time.", 
    "So, for example, if we have a signal like this, and you'll", 
    "see this early next week, we can break this up.", 
    "For example, let's actually have a more complex signal.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Yes.", 
    "Why don't we start with a really complex signal here.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Let's say you've got a signal like this.", 
    "And what you like to do is--", 
    "this shouldn't go backwards in time, but that's OK--", 
    "analyze this.", 
    "What's really critical is that you can break this up into a", 
    "bunch of different ways.", 
    "One way that you can break this up is into a bunch of", 
    "little steps.", 
    "You can, for example, break it up into a step like this, into", 
    "a step like this, into a step like this, into a step like", 
    "this, and so on and so forth.", 
    "And that set of steps--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Well, those are actually pulses.", 
    "They're impulses.", 
    "The steps would be only if I did what we do in elementary", 
    "calculus classes like that.", 
    "But that's also a good way to break things up.", 
    "But if you make the steps small enough, then what you're", 
    "looking at is little pieces of the curve.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And what could happen is, if you can see,", 
    "I've got this complex circuit, but let's say it's got all", 
    "linear components.", 
    "And I'd like to know what this does.", 
    "I can see the response of this twin impulse.", 
    "And then when I've got a waveform like this, once I've", 
    "got the response to an impulse, I can approximate a", 
    "waveform with some impulses and see what a", 
    "signal to it does.", 
    "I can drive it with a step, for example.", 
    "I can approximate with, as we said a moment ago, steps,", 
    "where, for example, this a step up", 
    "followed by a step down.", 
    "So I've got a step up.", 
    "I add a step down now to that, so something like this.", 
    "And at that point, what I'm left with will look--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Like a pulse.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Slightly longer than a pulse, but yes, I guess", 
    "a pulse, not an impulse, but a pulse.", 
    "And so I can figure out the response to one of these and", 
    "also use that to analyze these signals.", 
    "And what's perhaps most exciting is I can break this", 
    "up into sine waves.", 
    "Let's say I, for example, now have a square wave.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Oh yes.", 
    "This is the great invention of Mr. Fourier at the beginning", 
    "of the 1800s.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: What I can say is, hey, this looks a lot like a", 
    "sine wave like this.", 
    "And at that point, it's not exactly right.", 
    "So what I can do is I can--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Add another pile of sine.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: Add another sine wave that will raise it over", 
    "here and lower it over here, so now that", 
    "kind of looks I guess--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Yes, third harmonic.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: --like this.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: So three ways per wave.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: I'm drawing this very badly.", 
    "But basically, I end up with at that point--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: A better approximation to the square", 
    "wave. And then you can add some more-- something to fix", 
    "that error.", 
    "And you could do that forever, and you've got an infinite", 
    "series called a Fourier series, which we're not going", 
    "to talk about in this class.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: But at the end of it, it converges to the", 
    "original waveform.", 
    "It can get arbitrarily good convergence to any kind of", 
    "physically realistic waveform, which you're not going to have", 
    "to worry about.", 
    "There's that finite number of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]", 
    "and otherwise generally continuous.", 
    "You don't really care about that.", 
    "But what you do care about is that what this means is that", 
    "you can analyze the response to sine waves and at that", 
    "point understand how the circuit works.", 
    "And that's where you're going to get into this kind of", 
    "method that we mentioned before of complex impedances,", 
    "where you share a capacitor as if it were a", 
    "resistor as 1 over cj--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Omega.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: I guess I would say omega, or 1/cj--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: 2 pi f.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: --", 
    "2 pi f.", 
    "Or we could say--", 
    "well, I usually do 1/cs, but that's actually used after", 
    "this course.", 
    "And as you see that technique, that will simplify a lot of", 
    "this stuff that you do with differential equations.", 
    "So that's where this course is sort of going."
