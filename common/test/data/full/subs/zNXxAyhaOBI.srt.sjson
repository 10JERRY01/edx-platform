    "It's a huge capacitor.", 
    "That is a [? 250-watt ?]", 
    "capacitor, so it's nasty.", 
    "So he's charged it up, and he's kept it there.",

    "Maybe the first row should kind of just go backwards.", 
    "Just step back for a second.", 
    "I think you guys would be safe, but I just don't want to",
