    "PROFESSOR ANANT AGARWAL: OK, I hope you had a chance to try", 
    "to find out the initial conditions yourselves.", 
    "Let me go ahead and take a crack at doing this.", 
    "So our goal is to find the unknowns A1 and A2 from the", 
    "initial conditions, where the initial conditions are given", 
    "as v of 0 is 0, and i of 0 is 0.", 
    "So from the first initial condition, let me go ahead and", 
    "write down the equation at time t equal to 0.", 
    "So I set v of 0 equals 0, so at time t equal to", 
    "0, I get v of t--", 
    "I'm writing this equation here-- is 0.", 
    "So I get VI.", 
    "And if I substitute time t equal to 0 here and here, I", 
    "just get A1 plus A2.", 
    "So e raised to 0 omega naught 0 is 1, and e raised to minus", 
    "0 omega naught 0 is also 1.", 
    "So I get my first equation by using v of 0 equals 0.", 
    "Now, in order to do the next one, I've got to use this", 
    "little trick here, where, as I told you, i of t", 
    "is equal to C dv/dt.", 
    "So I'm told that that is 0.", 
    "So i of t is C dv/dt, so let me go ahead and take dv/dt out", 
    "there, so C dv/dt.", 
    "So dv/dt of the first part is a constant, so that is 0.", 
    "Then for this guy, it is C times A1 times e raised to j", 
    "omega naught t.", 
    "I've got to differentiate that with respect to t.", 
    "So if I differentiate that with respect to t, I get j", 
    "omega naught coming down, and e raised to j omega naught t.", 
    "And then, for the next part, I get a minus--", 
    "let me just write down C A2 j omega naught e raised to minus", 
    "j omega naught t.", 
    "So I just obtained dv/dt of this one and multiplied that", 
    "out by C.", 
    "So we know that given that i of t is equal to 0, so at time", 
    "t equal to 0, so at t equal to 0, i of 0 is 0.", 
    "So then this 0 is equal to this thing evaluated at time t", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "So this evaluated at t equals 0 is simply C A1 j omega", 
    "naught minus C A2 j omega naught.", 
    "And that equals 0.", 
    "So I can simplify that.", 
    "So C and C cancel out.", 
    "j omega naught and j omega naught cancel out.", 
    "Wow, that is pretty simple.", 
    "So I get A1 equals A2.", 
    "That was pretty simple.", 
    "So from i of 0 equals 0, I get something very simple.", 
    "A1 equals A2.", 
    "And then, I also know that from this expression here, A1", 
    "plus A2 plus VI equals 0.", 
    "And since A1 equals A2, then I know now that A1 will be equal", 
    "to minus VI divided by 2.", 
    "So if A1 equals A2, then let's say replace that", 
    "with the two A1.", 
    "So A1 will be minus VI divided by 2.", 
    "So therefore, A1 equals VI divided by 2, and that is also", 
    "equal to A1.", 
    "So if I take this expression here and substitute in for A1", 
    "and A2, what do I get?", 
    "So I get v of t is equal to VI minus--", 
    "OK, A1 is minus V by 2, and A2 is minus V by 2.", 
    "Both are the same.", 
    "So I get VI divided by 2.", 
    "And I can collect up in parentheses e raised to j", 
    "omega naught t plus e raised to minus j omega naught t.", 
    "There you go.", 
    "So there is my solution to the differential equation that I", 
    "started out with.", 
    "I'm still going to simplify it a little bit, so don't run off", 
    "to the bank yet.", 
    "But I've pretty much gotten the constants so far.", 
    "OK, let me--", 
    "this is a bit unwieldy here.", 
    "Let me simplify that a little bit before I give you the", 
    "trick to simplify it further.", 
    "When you see e raised to j something plus e raised to", 
    "minus j something, what comes to your mind?", 
    "So does it remind you of something?", 
    "Well, I again refer you to Appendix C of the textbook,", 
    "and that will give you the idea.", 
    "So let's go ahead and simplify it.", 
    "So I've rewritten my equation here, and I'm going to go", 
    "ahead and simplify it.", 
    "And the thing that comes to mind whenever you see e raised", 
    "to j something plus e raised to minus j something, where j", 
    "is the square root of minus 1, is the Euler relation.", 
    "Is it called the Euler relation here?", 
    "e raised to jx is given by cosine of x plus j sine of x.", 
    "That's the Euler relation.", 
    "And if you like, you can prove it to yourselves and verify it", 
    "using Taylor's expansion.", 
    "All right, so for now, take it for granted this is Euler's", 
    "relation. e raised to jx equals cosine x plus j sine x.", 
    "So what does e raised to jx plus e raised to", 
    "minus jx result in?", 
    "OK, let me go divide that by 2.", 
    "So if I take e raised to jx, which is this expression, and", 
    "e raised to minus jx will be what?", 
    "It's the same expression, but I get a minus sign on the", 
    "right-hand side for the second term.", 
    "And so when I add those up, the j sines cancel out,", 
    "leaving the 2 cosine.", 
    "And then I divide by 2, and that gives me a cosine x.", 
    "Oh, this should be x.", 
    "My apologies here.", 
    "OK, so e raised to jx.", 
    "And then for the minus jx, I get a minus sign here.", 
    "And so when I add up the two, e raised to plus jx and e", 
    "raised to minus jx, the sines cancel out, leaving me with", 
    "the two cosines.", 
    "Divide by 2, I get the cosine x.", 
    "So if I apply the Euler relation to our good old", 
    "expression here, notice I have e raised to j omega naught t", 
    "plus e raised to minus j omega naught t divided by 2.", 
    "So lo and behold, lo and behold, there's VI", 
    "and then minus VI.", 
    "And what happens to e raised to j omega naught t plus e", 
    "raised to minus j omega naught t divided by 2?", 
    "This stuff becomes a nice little cosine of", 
    "omega naught t.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "I just write that down here.", 
    "Cosine of omega naught t.", 
    "And where as you recall, omega naught was 1 by", 
    "square root of LC.", 
    "I know everything else.", 
    "I know VI.", 
    "That was the value of the step input. for t greater than or", 
    "equal to 0.", 
    "And notice this is for t greater than or equal to 0.", 
    "And my VI is--", 
    "input voltage is capital VI for t greater", 
    "than or equal to 0.", 
    "And I know VI.", 
    "This is the same as VI.", 
    "And omega naught is square root of 1 by LC.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "I have everything.", 
    "I could also very quickly write down i of t.", 
    "So write down i of t.", 
    "What is i of t?", 
    "i of t, as you recall, is simply C dv/dt.", 
    "So I can write that down pretty quickly.", 
    "So i of t is equal to C dv/dt.", 
    "So dv/dt of this part goes to 0, and I get dv/dt of minus VI", 
    "cosine omega naught t.", 
    "So dv/dt of cosine gives me a minus.", 
    "So the minus minus cancel out.", 
    "So I get a VI here as expected.", 
    "And differentiating cosine omega naught t gives me omega", 
    "naught sine omega naught t.", 
    "And there are our solutions.", 
    "So this is i of t, and this is v of t.", 
    "So that's the trajectory of the voltage across the", 
    "capacitor as a function of time, and this is the", 
    "trajectory of the current as a function of time.", 
    "And again, lo and behold, the output of this second-order", 
    "circuit looks sinusoidal.", 
    "So mathematically, we've shown that the second-order circuit", 
    "will result in a sinusoidal response, and here we go.", 
    "It doesn't quite explain a decaying sinusoid, but that", 
    "will show up later once we add the resistance.", 
    "But for now, I have shown you that for a second-order", 
    "circuit, I've shown you that, although I did not have any", 
    "other sines in the system, I managed to get", 
    "a sinusoidal behavior.", 
    "Isn't that amazing?", 
    "I put in a step input into my circuit.", 
    "And the step input resulted in this funky sine wave output.", 
    "That is pretty cool.", 
    "So as the next step, I'd like to plot these waveforms, and", 
    "show you what they look like, and give you the facility to", 
    "start playing with waveforms like this, and drawing these", 
    "sinusoids, both for the voltages and the currents."
