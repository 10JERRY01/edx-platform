    "SPEAKER: OK so let's go ahead and do that.", 
    "So in this diagram, I'm going to plot the waveform for you.", 
    "So this is VS, VS here.", 
    "And this is VS divided by 2.", 
    "And this is minus VS divided by 2.", 
    "So my time axis is here.", 
    "And I want to plot a few voltages.", 
    "OK, I'm going to plot V0.", 
    "I am going to plot V plus.", 
    "And I'm going to plot VC.", 
    "OK, I'll do three plots.", 
    "I will plot V0 in red.", 
    "OK, so V0 in red.", 
    "Let me plot VC in green.", 
    "So let me change that to green here.", 
    "So I'll plot VC in green.", 
    "And let me plot V0 in blue, OK?", 
    "So let me plot V0 in blue.", 
    "OK, as I said, when the volt starts, my V0 is-- so this is", 
    "V0 in blue--", 
    "V0 is at VS. I'm just saying that the volt starts with V0", 
    "and VS, OK?", 
    "So that's how it's going to be.", 
    "What is VS?", 
    "So VS, because V0 is at VS, so V plus is going to be at VS", 
    "divided by 2.", 
    "OK, what about VC?", 
    "So I said, VC is going to start off at 0.", 
    "And it's going to start off here.", 
    "And because VC is at 0, so let's say VC is at 0 volts and", 
    "V0 is at 15 volts VS, notice that it's going to start", 
    "charging the capacitor with the current, i, given by 15", 
    "volts divided by R. And that's going to start", 
    "charging up the capacitor.", 
    "OK, this current is going to charge up the capacitor", 
    "because that current cannot go into the negative terminal of", 
    "the op amp.", 
    "So I'm going to get a charging waveform for the capacitor", 
    "that looks like this.", 
    "Now left to itself, suppose somehow, magically, the", 
    "capacitor could be left to itself, and the op amp doesn't", 
    "change its behavior.", 
    "The capacitor would have kept charging.", 
    "OK, the capacitor would have kept charging.", 
    "If I did not have the positive connection, the capacitor", 
    "would have kept charging until the capacitor voltage reached", 
    "VS.", 
    "OK, the capacitor would have kept charging until its", 
    "voltage reached VS. And then it would stop charging because", 
    "it's voltage, VC, would be VS. And that would equal the", 
    "voltage across the output, 15 volts, OK?", 
    "So eventually, the capacitor would charge up to 15 volts.", 
    "And that's where it would stop.", 
    "But funny things happen when the", 
    "capacitor reaches 7.5 volts.", 
    "What happens there?", 
    "When the capacitor reaches 7.5 volts, so I", 
    "get 7.5 volts here.", 
    "And when the voltage exceeds 7.5 volts ever so slightly--", 
    "V0 by 2 is at 7.5 volts, this is assuming VS is 15--", 
    "then I get a net negative voltage at the input of the op", 
    "amp that causes the output to go [UNINTELLIGIBLE]", 
    "negative.", 
    "So the output is going to switch at this point and go to", 
    "minus 15 volts.", 
    "OK, so V0 is going to switch to minus 15", 
    "volts at that point.", 
    "And if V0 switches to minus 15 volts, V plus will switch to", 
    "minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "So V plus will switch to here.", 
    "It will switch to minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "And it will be here.", 
    "What about the capacitor?", 
    "OK, if VS is at minus 15, so VS goes to minus 15 volts, and", 
    "if my V plus goes to minus 7.5 volts, what happens now?", 
    "So now recall the capacitor is at 7.5 volts, OK?", 
    "So the capacitor is at 7.5 volts, but Vo is at minus 15", 
    "volts, which means that I'm going to start seeing a", 
    "current going in this direction here, this charging", 
    "the capacitor.", 
    "And the current is going to be 7.5 minus minus 15, will be", 
    "7.5 plus 15 divided by R.", 
    "OK, that current is going to discharge the capacitor", 
    "because the capacitor starts to discharge.", 
    "So this capacitor is going to start to discharge and start", 
    "going down like this.", 
    "OK, and left to itself, it would keep discharging until", 
    "its voltage reached minus 15 volts, OK?", 
    "However, as soon as the capacitor gets to this point,", 
    "what happens?", 
    "OK, before I tell you what happens, let me just draw out", 
    "V0 and VS until that point.", 
    "OK, now the moment the capacitor hits minus 7.5", 
    "volts, when the capacitor hits minus 7.5", 
    "volts here, what happens?", 
    "So now the capacitor hits minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "Notice that V plus is at minus 7.5 volts as well.", 
    "And so, when the capacitor tends to go negative, let's", 
    "say minus 7.6 volts, OK, notice now that V plus minus V", 
    "minus has a net positive voltage, OK?", 
    "So minus 7.5 minus minus 7.6 is plus 0.1 volts.", 
    "So it's a net positive voltage.", 
    "What that will do, it will cause the output to, boom, go", 
    "up to plus VS.", 
    "OK, output shoots up the plus VS. And because the output", 
    "shoots up to plus VS, V plus will shoot up to plus VS", 
    "divided by 2, OK?", 
    "So V plus will shoot up to this point.", 
    "OK, what happens now?", 
    "OK, I'm sure you're getting the gist of", 
    "what is going on here.", 
    "But I'll continue for one or two more cycles.", 
    "So at this point, my output has gone to plus 15 volts, OK?", 
    "And V plus has gone to plus 7.5 volts.", 
    "My capacitor is at minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "OK, so my cap is at minus 7.5 volts down here.", 
    "OK, so if my output is at plus 15 and my capacitor is at", 
    "minus 7.5, so I get a charging current flowing in the", 
    "opposite direction now.", 
    "OK, so now, we can start discharging.", 
    "Because my output is positive, I start charging the capacitor", 
    "with a 15 plus 7.5 volts divided by R current, so a", 
    "charging of the capacitor.", 
    "So now, instead of discharging, my capacitor", 
    "starts to charge up.", 
    "And left to itself, it would have gone on to VS, OK?", 
    "But as soon as the capacitor hits 7.5 volts, boom, my", 
    "output switches again.", 
    "My output switches again and goes negative, OK?", 
    "And correspondingly, V plus switches from 7.5 volts, which", 
    "is to corresponding minus 7.5 volts.", 
    "And then, when that happens, the capacitor starts to", 
    "discharge, OK?", 
    "So the capacitor starts to discharge.", 
    "And this cycle of life repeats, OK?", 
    "The capacitor tries to go on forever, but now, at this", 
    "point, it's going to cause a switch again, OK?", 
    "So the upshot is notice that I've built an oscillator.", 
    "Notice how my output, V0, is oscillating back and forth", 
    "between plus 15 and minus 15 volts, OK?", 
    "And it's going to sit there and just keep oscillating back", 
    "and forth, OK?", 
    "And just remember, in this diagram here, I have assumed", 
    "that VC was initially 0.", 
    "I also assumed that VS was the voltage at V0.", 
    "OK, so both V0 was equal to VS at equal to 0 and the", 
    "capacitor voltage was 0, OK?", 
    "So I assumed that my volts started out that way.", 
    "And I drew my diagram here assuming that.", 
    "OK, so hopefully, this gave you an intuitive picture as to", 
    "how this worked.", 
    "So the next step, you all know how to solve this, but I'll", 
    "give you some quick insight into how to calculate what the", 
    "frequency of this oscillator will be.", 
    "And we give you a little exercise to do that.", 
    "But before we do that, let me give you some intuition as to", 
    "how to compute what these times are, OK?", 
    "But fundamentally, it simply relates to the discharge or", 
    "the charge transient for the capacitor."
