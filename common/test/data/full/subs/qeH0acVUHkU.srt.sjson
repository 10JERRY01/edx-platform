    "SPEAKER 1: So you just saw a rather impressive demo of how", 
    "the digital design discipline gives you the", 
    "immunity from noise.", 
    "And what this relies on is that if you have an inverter,", 
    "for example, you have a wide region over which inputs can", 
    "come in and those get compressed into smaller", 
    "regions over here.", 
    "So if your input is anywhere in this region, your output", 
    "might be in this much narrower region.", 
    "And if your input is anywhere in this region, your output", 
    "might be somewhere in this narrower region.", 
    "So you get a curve that kind of slopes down very quickly", 
    "and then comes across here, where here the slope is", 
    "steeper than minus 1.", 
    "And over the next two lectures we're", 
    "going to show you circuits.", 
    "We'll probably build something like this.", 
    "The basic circuit for an inverter looks like this.", 
    "The basic device you haven't seen yet is called a", 
    "transistor.", 
    "And we're going to show you what a transistor is, how it", 
    "behaves, and what its properties are", 
    "in different regions.", 
    "So a transistor is a device that's", 
    "basically a type of switch.", 
    "It's a soft switch, so we can turn it on partially and turn", 
    "it off partially.", 
    "where there is a terminal called the gate.", 
    "And the voltage with the gate and the source, this third", 
    "terminal right here is called the source.", 
    "This is the gate, this is the source, this is the drain.", 
    "Controls how much current flows between the drain and", 
    "the source.", 
    "And there are three possible modes of operation for this.", 
    "In one mode of operation, the gate-source voltage is too", 
    "small to turn this device on and there's almost no current", 
    "between the drain and the source.", 
    "So that's this first region right here.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: That's called the cutoff region.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: This second region of operation, there is some", 
    "voltage through the gate and the source.", 
    "And that voltage is sufficient that current can flow this way", 
    "and it acts like a constant current source.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And that's called the saturation region.", 
    "And there's a third region, which we're not going to use", 
    "in this class, called the triode region which is when", 
    "the drain to source voltage is too small to control", 
    "what's going on.", 
    "Very clearly, this is a region we're not going to use.", 
    "Let's put it that way, now important.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So this model is very complex.", 
    "And we won't actually use this model very much, at least for", 
    "the digital part of a class.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: In fact, the very first model we use is just a", 
    "simple switch.", 
    "If the gate to source voltage is larger than the threshold", 
    "voltage, then we have the thing turned on.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And it acts as a perfect switch.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And if the gate to source voltage is smaller than", 
    "the threshold voltage, which is what you're seeing over", 
    "here, then the current is 0 and nothing can get through.", 
    "So that's the simplest model for understanding an inverter.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: And in this case, what happens is as Vin goes", 
    "above the threshold this is a complete short, and so your", 
    "curve over here, when it is a perfect short, the output is", 
    "just at ground.", 
    "So above some threshold it's at 0.", 
    "And above the threshold, it disconnects so", 
    "it goes to 3.3 volts.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Exactly.", 
    "Now however, that turns out not to be very good for", 
    "understanding the analog properties", 
    "of a digital circuit.", 
    "This is a more useful model for that purpose called the", 
    "switch resistor model.", 
    "And what we're basically doing is adding some resistance that", 
    "accounts for the behavior of the switch when it's on.", 
    "And now that means that if you have an inverter here, then", 
    "what ends up happening is this is a voltage", 
    "divider when it's on.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So you either end up with two resistors when", 
    "this device is switched on or you end up with just a", 
    "resistor over here and open over here.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: And you pulse it up.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So you either end up with 3.3 volts on the", 
    "output or you end up with some intermediate voltage.", 
    "So it's the same curve as here, only instead of going", 
    "all the way down--", 
    "SPEAKER 2: It goes to there.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: --there's an elbow where it stops right there.", 
    "SPEAKER 2: Right.", 
    "Finally, when we actually want to deal with the real analog", 
    "properties of the device, we have to put in what's called a", 
    "dependent source, which you haven't learned about yet, but", 
    "indeed that captures at least the parts of the model that we", 
    "actually are using in this class.", 
    "SPEAKER 1: So what happens here is you've got a", 
    "gate-source voltage and that gate-source voltage controls", 
    "how much current flows between the drain and the source.", 
    "And this is the model that we're going to use as we move", 
    "out of the digital domain and into designing analog", 
    "amplifiers later in the course.", 
    "So that's a preview of the next few lectures.", 
    "In the next sequence, you're going to see just some more", 
    "basic digital circuits and then from there on we'll", 
    "eventually move to more analog."
