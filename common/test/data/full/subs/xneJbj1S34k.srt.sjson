    "SPEAKER: As an example of a second order LC circuit, again", 
    "I don't want to introduce registers just yet.", 
    "Let me pick a very simple scenario that looks like this.", 
    "I have an inductor connected to a capacitor.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "The voltage across the capacitor is vc and the", 
    "current through the capacitor is ic.", 
    "And in this situation, let me assume that the capacitor,", 
    "when I start off the world, I'm going to start off the", 
    "capacitor with a voltage V across it.", 
    "And I'm going to start off the inductor with a current 0", 
    "going through it.", 
    "Notice that the same current ic will flow through the", 
    "inductor as well.", 
    "It's a circuit that goes like this.", 
    "So the same current ic flows through the inductor as well.", 
    "And I'm telling you that the current through", 
    "the inductor is 0.", 
    "So this situation is reminiscent of", 
    "your 0 input response.", 
    "I don't have any input connected to the circuit, I", 
    "just have some state.", 
    "In this case, the capacitor voltage is finite.", 
    "It's V and my inductor current is 0.", 
    "So in this situation, it actually turns out that my", 
    "input is 0.", 
    "I can actually obtain the response of the circuit", 
    "directly from the homogeneous solution where the homogeneous", 
    "solution was for capital V capital I being 0.", 
    "K, there we go.", 
    "So I'm not going to go through the whole differential", 
    "equation to solve it, but I'll simply write down the solution", 
    "that we obtain for the homogeneous part and then go", 
    "and substitute in the various values of the initial", 
    "conditions to find the various constants.", 
    "So let's go right ahead and solve this.", 
    "So I've written up some notes here for ourselves.", 
    "So here's my circuit, it's a inductor and capacitor circuit", 
    "with a current ic, voltage vc across it.", 
    "My initial conditions are given here.", 
    "So as I said earlier, we can obtain the answer directly", 
    "from the homogeneous solution.", 
    "And you recall we had marked the homogeneous solution with", 
    "an asterisk, just that I have chosen VI to be 0.", 
    "So the homogeneous solution had a plus VI in here.", 
    "And I'm just setting the VI to be 0.", 
    "So that's my homogeneous solution", 
    "from my previous efforts.", 
    "So right now all I have to do is--", 
    "this is my total solution.", 
    "The homogeneous solution is my total solution.", 
    "Because all I have to do is find the unknowns, A1 and A2,", 
    "from the initial conditions.", 
    "And as before, recall that omega 0 is 1 by square root of", 
    "LC, the inductance and the capacitance.", 
    "So let's start.", 
    "So let's start by substituting in capital V for the initial", 
    "condition at 0.", 
    "At time t equal to 0, I get V here.", 
    "And the two e raised to components go to 1.", 
    "So I get A1 plus A2.", 
    "That was simple enough.", 
    "Next, let me go and compute what the constants come out to", 
    "be for the initial condition on the current.", 
    "And remember, for the current, i of t is given by c dv dt.", 
    "So I can take c dv dt of this equation here and then", 
    "substitute for--", 
    "at time t equal to 0, the whole thing will go to 0.", 
    "So let me go ahead and start by taking c dv", 
    "dt 0 for that equation.", 
    "So first of all, I note since i of c is 0, I know", 
    "that will be 0.", 
    "So what is c dv dt of this equation here?", 
    "So the first expression c A1 dv dt will give me j omega 0 e", 
    "raised to minus--", 
    "I'm sorry, e raised to j omega 0 t.", 
    "And at t equal to 0, e raised to j omega 0 t equals to 1.", 
    "So that's it.", 
    "For the next piece, again, I get a c.", 
    "Then I have an A2.", 
    "And in this case, it's minus j omega 0.", 
    "So I get a minus j omega 0 e raised to minus j omega 0t.", 
    "And that evaluated at time t equal to 0 simply gives me 1.", 
    "So e raised to minus j omega 0t for t equals 0 is 1.", 
    "So this is it.", 
    "And so again, I can cancel out the c's, the", 
    "j's, the omega 0's.", 
    "And so this implies that A1 equals A2.", 
    "So since A1 equals A2 and A1 plus A2 equals V, I simply get", 
    "A1 equals A2 equals V divided by 2.", 
    "That was simple enough.", 
    "So in terms of my solution, I can write down vc of t is", 
    "equal to A1 e raised to j omega 0t plus A2 e raised to j", 
    "omega 0t where A1 and A2 are both V divided by 2.", 
    "So I can write that down as e raised to j omega 0t plus e", 
    "raised to minus j omega 0t.", 
    "K, simple enough.", 
    "And from that, because I know from Euler's relation e raised", 
    "to j omega 0t plus e raised to minus j omega 0t divided by 2", 
    "is simply cosine omega 0t.", 
    "So this is simply V cosine omega 0t.", 
    "So this is vc.", 
    "And for the current ic, it is simply c dv dt.", 
    "So it will be CV dv dt of cosine omega 0t is minus omega", 
    "0 sine omega 0t.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "So this is my solution to the voltage and current for the", 
    "circuit, which has no input voltage applied, but just has", 
    "an initial condition of the capacitor.", 
    "Again, isn't this remarkable?", 
    "I just stuck a little capacitor and inductor", 
    "together with the initial condition on the capacitor.", 
    "And what that is telling me is that if I did that, that", 
    "circuit will simply sit there and oscillate.", 
    "The voltage will go back and forth between across the", 
    "capacitor, then across the inductor.", 
    "The energy goes sloshing back and forth.", 
    "And I'll cover the energy in more detail in a second.", 
    "So let me start by plotting the voltage and", 
    "the current for you.", 
    "And then I'll go ahead and plot the energy relations for", 
    "you as well."
