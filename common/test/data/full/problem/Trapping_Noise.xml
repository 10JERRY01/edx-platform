We have a problem in a measurement system.  The useful signal is
developed by a sensor that we model as a current source, which
develops a voltage at a recording instrument that we model with a
resistor. 
<center><img src="/static/circuits/SensorRecorder.gif"/></center>
The input resistance of the recording instrument \(R_R =
$RR\Omega\).  The signal we are looking for is \(I_s =
$ISu\mu\)A.  What is the signal voltage, in milliVolts, that we expect
at the recorder?

<br/>
Our instrument encounters some nasty
interference in the audio range, at a specific frequency \(f =
$f0o\)Hz.  We can model the noise as an additional source in our
circuit. 
<br/>
One way to fix the interference problem is to make a "trap" that
shorts out the interfering signal.  For example, we could use a series
resonant circuit tuned to the interfering frequency: 
<center><img src="/static/circuits/SeriesTrap.gif"/></center>
We happen to have an inductor with inductance \(L = $Lm\)mH.
What capacitance, in microFarads, should we use to best attenuate the
interference? 
<endouttext/>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, our inductor is imperfect: it has a series resistance
\(R_L = $RLo\Omega\).  This limits the attenuation that we can achieve
with this trap.  If \(V_n\) is the amplitude of the noise voltage at
the recorder without the trap, and if \(V_{no}\) is the amplitude of
the noise voltage at the recorder with the trap in place, what is the
magnitude of the ratio \(V_{no}/V_n\)?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$vnovn"><responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/><textline/></numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
Now suppose a large noise pulse comes into the system.  Which of the 
following approximate graphs is most likely to be the response as seen
at the recorder?  The horizontal scale is time, in seconds. The
vertical scale is voltage, scaled so that the pulse starts out the
response at 1.0. 
<br/>
(Careful! Think about how the load resistance of the recorder influences
the Q of the circuit for the response.)
