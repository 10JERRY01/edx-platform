One way to model a vehicle is as a massive object that is connected by
springs and shock absorbers to the wheels.  Here is a simple model:
<center>
<img src="/static/circuits/Vehicle.gif" />
</center>
There is a mass \(m\) suspended by a spring with spring constant \(k\)
and a oil-filled shock-absorber with viscous friction constant \(b\)
over a wheel base.  The wheels ride over a rough road that moves up
and down.  We will only model the vertical motion, with vertical
displacement \(y\).  If you remember your basic physics you will be
able to see that the balance-of-forces equation governing the motion
in the \(y\) direction is just a second-order linear
constant-coefficient ordinary differential equation:
<br/><br/>
\( m \frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2} + b \frac{d y(t)}{dt} + k (y(t) - Y_{road}(t)) = 0 \)
<br/><br/>
(Don't worry if you don't remember this: we are giving you the equation.)
<br/><br/>
Now this equation looks very much like the equation governing a driven
RLC circuit:
<center>
<img src="/static/circuits/VRLC.gif" />
</center>
<br/><br/>
\( L C \frac{d^2 v_C(t)}{dt^2} + R C \frac{d v_C(t)}{dt} +  v_C(t) = V(t) \)
<br/><br/>
Indeed, if we think of the charge on the capacitor \(q\) as analogous to the
displacement \(y\), and if we note that \(q = C v\) we can rewrite
this equation as:
<br/><br/>
\( L \frac{d^2 q(t)}{dt^2} + R \frac{d q(t)}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}q(t) -  V(t) = 0 \)
<br/><br/>
So the inductance is analogous to the mass (inertia), the resistance
is analogous to the viscous friction, the reciprocal of the
capacitance is analogous to the spring constant, and the variations of
height of the road is analogous to the voltage drive (scaled by \(C\).
<br/><br/>
When we hit a bump, a vehicle may oscillate, just like an underdamped circuit.

Since this is second order the characteristic polynomial is of the form:
<br/><br/>
\(s^2 + 2 \alpha s + \omega_0^2 = 0\)
<br/><br/>
For our differential equation what are the values of \(\alpha\) and
\(\omega_0\)?  Write algebraic expressions for them in terms of the
mechanical parameters \(m\), \(b\), and \(k\), in the spaces below.

Suppose that the shock absorber is dead, so \(b = 0\).  Write an
algebraic expression for the frequency, in Hertz, of the bouncing of
our vehicle.  Your expression should be in terms of \(m\) and \(k\).

<formularesponse type="cs" samples="b,m,k@1,1,1:3,3,3#10" answer="$f0">

    <textline size="40" />    
</formularesponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
We can make the frequency of the bouncing go to zero by picking an
appropriate value of the viscous-friction coefficient \(b\).  (This is
called critical damping.)  Write an algebraic expression for
the value of \(b\) that will make this vehicle critically damped.
