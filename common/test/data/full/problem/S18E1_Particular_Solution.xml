We have the circuit
<center><img src="/static/circuits/VRLC1.gif"/></center>
with the input \(v_I(t) = V_I u(t)\) and with initial conditions
\(v(0) = 0\) and \(i(0) = 0\).
The capacitor voltage in this system is described by a second-order
linear constant-coefficient ordinary differential equation:
<br/><br/>
\(L C \frac{d^2 v(t)}{dt^2} + R C \frac{d v(t)}{dt} + v(t) = V_I u(t) \)
<br/><br/>
After \(t=0\) the step becomes a constant.  
<br/>
So first we need a particular solution \(v_P(t)\) to the equation:
<br/><br/>
\(L C \frac{d^2 v_P(t)}{dt^2} + R C \frac{d v_P(t)}{dt} + v_P(t) = V_I \)
<br/><br/>
(Any particular solution will do, because we will use the
associated homogeneous equation to match up the initial conditions.)
<br/>
We can use \(v_P(t)\) as the value that satisfies the
equation and makes all the derivative terms in the equation zero.
<br/>
What is this particular solution \(v_P(t)\)?

<br/>
This particular solution is not yet the solution to our problem,
because it does not match the initial conditions.
