Lem E. Tweakit had a problem.  He bought a mystery apparatus at an
electrical flea market.
One element in the apparatus was unmarked and not
obviously identified, but when he measured its behavior in a curve
tracer he found that it was a nonlinear resistor with the
characteristic shown in the figure:

Lem was afraid to test this device with a current greater than 2mA.

<br/>
What is the resistance (in kOhms) when the current is small: less than
1mA?

What is the resistance (in kOhms) when the current is outside that
range?

In the circuit that Lem found this the strange element, it was
connected to a power supply of \(V_s=$Vs\)V with a series resistance
of \(R_s=$Rs\Omega\) and it was shunted with a parallel resistance of
\(R_p=$Rp\Omega\).

What is the current (in Amperes) through the strange object when it is
in operation in the circuit?
