Joe was debugging part of an experimental apparatus, probing around
with his voltmeter.  Part of the apparatus had two obvious resistors
in series with an unknown element, as shown in the diagram below:
<center><img src="/static/circuits/KVL-0.gif"/></center>
The unknown element is hard to reach, so
Joe put the negative (black) probe of his voltmeter at the interconnection of the
two obvious resistors and then put the positive (red) probe at the other
end of each resistor, measuring \(v_1 = $v1 \)V and \(v_2 = $v2 \)V.
<br/>
<br/>
What is the voltage (in Volts) \(v_3\) measured across the unknown element?
