We have just learned the v-i characteristic for a linear inductor:
<br/><br/>
<center>
\(v = L \frac{d i}{d t}\)
</center>
<br/><br/>
So the power entering the inductor (as in any two-terminal device) is:
<br/><br/>
<center>
\(P = v i = L i \frac{d i}{d t} \)
</center>
<br/><br/>
If we integrate this between two times we get the energy change in the
inductor over the interval:
<br/><br/>
<center>
\( \Delta E = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} P(t) dt 
            = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} L i(t) \frac{d i(t)}{d t}  dt 
            = \frac{1}{2} L (i({t_1}))^2 - \frac{1}{2} L (i({t_0}))^2 
\)
</center>
<br/><br/>
So the energy stored in an inductor, as a function of the current
through it, is:
<br/><br/>
<center>
\( E = \frac{1}{2} L i^2 \)
</center>
<br/><br/>

Inductors are used in buck-boost converters as part of the power
supply of a mobile device such as a cell phone.  For example,  
<a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/slvs520b/slvs520b.pdf"> see.</a>
In a typical application the inductor might have an inductance of
\($Lu\mu\)H and the peak current might be \($I\)A.
<br/>
How much energy, in Joules, is stored in the inductor at the time of the peak
current?

This energy, stored in the inductor, is dumped into a capacitor on a timescale
of perhaps 0.25\(\mu\)s.
<br/>
What is the peak power (in Watts) of this transaction?
