You just saw a derivation of the impedance of a resistor and the
impedance of a capacitor.  You are to derive the impedance of an
inductor.  In the space provided below write an algebraic expression
in terms of angular frequency \(\omega\) and inductance \(L\) for the
ratio of the complex amplitude of the voltage across an inductor to
the complex amplitude of the current through the inductor.  (As usual,
use \(w\) for \(\omega\) in your expression.)
