A certain light sensor is modeled as a current source that produces a
current proportional to the intensity of light falling on it.  There
is leakage through the sensor, modeled by a resistor \(R_p=$RpM\)M\(\Omega\) in
parallel with the current source.
There is resistance in the contacts to the sensor, modeled by the
series resistances \(R_s=$RsK\)k\(\Omega\).  In this experiment the light produces
a current of \(I=$Iu\mu\)A.

It is useful to summarize this model
by constructing a Thevenin equivalent circuit for it.

<br/>  What is the Thevenin voltage (in Volts) \(V_{TH}\) of the sensor?

<br/> <br/> The sensor is intended to be used in a light meter.  In
this application the output of the sensor is connected to a system
that amplifies the signal and displays it, scaled to appropriate
units.

The amplifier is designed to present a resistance of 
\(R_L=$RlK\)k\(\Omega\).  So, from the point of view of the sensor we can
model it as just a resistor.

<br/>  What is the voltage (in Volts) \(V_L\) presented to the amplifier?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$Vl"><responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/><textline/></numericalresponse>


<startouttext/>
<br/> <br/> Note that the circuit connecting the sensor to the
amplifier and display does not care about the insides of either the
sensor or of the the amplifier and display.  So we don't have to
consider those complications to compute the properties of their
interconnection.  This is the modeling power of the Thevenin idea!
