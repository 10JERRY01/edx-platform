Now, let's find out what happens when the pulse becomes very short but
very high.  If we choose \(Is = A/T\) then the area of the pulse is
kept constant \(A\), independent of the length of the pulse.
<br/>
So now, our independent current source puts out a pulse of
height \(I_S = A/T\) that starts at time \(t=0\) and ends at time \(t = T\).
<br/>
Thus \(I(t) = \frac{A}{T} (u(t) - u(t-T))\).

<br/>
Continuing with the inductor current \(i_L(t) = 0\) for \(t &lt; 0\).  
<br/><br/>
In the box provided below write an algebraic expression for
the value of \(\lim_{T \to 0} i_L(t)\).

To see this in operation, here is a set of response graphs for a
circuit with time-constant 1/4 second, to a sequence of narrowing
pulses of 1/4 second and area 2.

Because this limit exists we can invent a new function symbol
representing an infinitely tall and infinitely narrow pulse.  We
define \(\delta(t)\) as an infinitesimal pulse of area 1 at \(t=0\)
and zero everywhere else.  This is called an "impulse".
<br/><br/>
Mathematically, introducing impulses is a big step, because
\(\delta\) does not satisfy the usual requirements for a function.  It
is a
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_%28mathematics%29">
  distribution</a>, which generalizes the notion of a function.  But
we do not expect you to learn that very advanced material for
use in this class :-).
<br/><br/>
Notice what the impulse did: it "instantaneously" changed the current
through the inductor, thus setting the initial conditions for the
exponential decay that follows.  In fact, it incremented the current
in the inductor by the area of the impulse divided by the time
constant of the circuit, as seen from the inductor.
<br/><br/>
Notice also that in this problem the area is the product of current
and time, hence charge: we put out an impulse whose area can be
expressed in Coulombs (C).
