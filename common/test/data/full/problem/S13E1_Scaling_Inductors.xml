An inductor is a device that stores energy in the magnetic field.  The
characteristic parameter \(L\) of an inductor is called "inductance", which
is measured in units of Henrys, after Joseph Henry, who discovered the
phenomena of self inductance and of mutual inductance.
See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry"> Henry</a>
for more historical information about this great scientist/engineer.

For a mechanical analogy, inductance is analogous to inertia.  If
voltage is analogous to force, and charge is analogous to
displacement, then current is analogous to velocity and magnetic flux \(\Phi\)
is analogous to momentum.  So the law for a linear inductor is
analogous to Newton's law of motion:
<br/><br/>
<center>
\(\Phi = L i\ \Longleftrightarrow\ p = m v\)
</center>
<br/><br/>
and
<br/><br/>
<center>
\(v = L \frac{d i}{d t}\)
</center>
<br/><br/>
The inductance of an inductor is determined by its geometry and the
magnetic properties of the materials it is made out of.  For example,
for a solenoidal inductor (with \(N\) turns of wire wrapped around a
core of area \(A\) and length \(l\) we have:
<br/><br/>
<center>
\(L = \mu \frac{N^2 A}{l}\)
</center>
<br/><br/>
The constant of proportionality \(\mu\) is called the "permeability"
of the core on which the solenoid is wound.  The permeability is a
property of the material of the core.

The permeability of the vacuum is \(\mu_0 = 4\pi\times 10^{-7}\).  
This is also called the
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?mu0|search_for=universal_in!">
 magnetic constant</a>.
Magnetic materials, such as manganese-zinc ferrite, have a higher
permeability than the vacuum.  The ratio of the permeability of a
material to the permeability of the vacuum is called the "relative
permeability" of the material.  For example, the relative permeability
of one kind of manganese-zinc ferrite is about \($k\).  For more information
