Parallel resonant "tank" circuits are common in radio equipment.  But
unfortunately there is always resistance that prevents them from being
perfect: in every real inductor, the wire that makes up the inductance
has some resistance, and there may be leakage in the capacitor that
can be modeled as a resistance.  Also, the Norton resistance of the
system connected to the tank circut looks like a leakage through the
capacitor.  So a realistic model for a tank circuit is the following:

In the space provided below write an algebraic expression in terms of
the device parameters for the bandwidth \(\Delta\omega\) of the
impedance \(Z\) looking into this tank circuit.

The antenna tank of a 
<a href="https://mmm1127.verio-web.com/grayma/catalog/536nb.htm"> 
Graymark 536 Radio Kit </a>
has an inductance \(L \approx $Lm\)mH.  The resistance of the inductor
\(R_L \approx $RL\Omega\).  The equivalent resistance across the
capacitor is \(R_C \approx $RCk\)k\(\Omega\).  The capacitor is
variable, for tuning.

of the tuning capacitor?

So it is apparent that this is not the only circuit in the radio that
selects the desired station from stations on adjacent channels.
