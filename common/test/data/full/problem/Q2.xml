A resistive load is attached to a two-terminal "black box".
<center><img src="/static/circuits/x1.gif"/></center>
The "black box" contains only linear resistors and independent sources.
<br/>
The voltage across the load is measured to be \(v=$v1\)V when the current
through the load is measured to be \(i=$i1\)A.
<br/><br/>
The load is then changed and the voltage across the new load is measured
to be \(v=$v2\)V when the current through the load is measured to be
\(i=$i2\)A.
<br/><br/>
If the resistive load is replaced by a short circuit, what is the
current, in Amperes, that flows through the short circuit?

If the resistive load is replaced by an open circuit, what is the
voltage, in Volts, that appears across the open circuit?
