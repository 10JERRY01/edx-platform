The electrical circuit language is a powerful language for modeling
other kinds of systems, such as mechanical, chemical, thermal, and
fluidic systems.  Here is an example from physiology: drug delivery.
<br/><br/>
Suppose we want to understand what happens when a medical doctor
injects a drug into an person.  For example, the doctor may need to
know how the concentration of an antibiotic will vary at a target site
with time.  To be effective, the concentration must be high enough for
long enough to kill the invading bacteria, but not so high as to
damage healthy tissues.
<br/><br/>
We can model the amount of the drug by charge and the concentration of
the drug by voltage.  Thus, we get a very simple model:
<center>
<img src="/static/circuits/norton-capacitor.gif" />
</center>
\(I\) models the rate of injection of the drug into the body.
<br/>
\(v_C\) models the concentration of the drug in the body.
<br/>
\(1/R\) models the rate of elimination of the drug.
<br/>
\(C\) models the size of the body.
<br/><br/>
Of course, this model is very crude, but it can be elaborated.  With
more circuitry we could model the concentrations in the blood, the
elimination in the kidneys, the concentrations in 
various organs, the degradation of the drug in the liver, the
elimination of the degraded products by the kidneys, etc.  So this can
be very complicated, for another time!
<br/><br/>
If the time constants for these processes are on the order of hours,
and the injection takes tens of seconds, it is apparent that the exact
profile of the rate of injection does not matter.  If the doctor takes
5 seconds or 10 seconds to inject the same amount of antibiotic, the
profile of concentration in the blood should be about the same for
times on the order of hours.  Thus, an injection can be modeled as an
impulse.  (This is just a mental experiment: most antibiotics cannot be
injected this way, they can be given intravenously, over a period of
an hour, thus making a pulse rather than an impulse.)
<br/><br/>
So, let's do some numbers.
Consider the consequences of injecting \(Q=$Qm\)mg of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin">cipro</a>
into a \(C=70\)kg person.  Assume
<br/>
The person is entirely made of water, which weighs 1kg/L.
<br/>
By the end of the injection the antibiotic is uniformly 
distributed in all of the body tissues.
<br/><br/>
What is the initial concentration after the injection \(v_C(0_+)\), of the
antibiotic in the body, in mg/L?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$vcpum">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol"
                   description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
The half-life of the antibiotic in the person is about
\(t_{h}=$thh\)Hours.  Thus, the concentration will drop to half of its
initial value in that time.  What is the resistance, in seconds/liter, in our model
circuit, that will produce this rate of loss of concentration?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$R">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol"
                   description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
If the doctor wants to keep the concentration between 1/4 and 2/3 of
the initial concentration, what is longest time, in hours, that may be
allowed to elapse before a new injection is required?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$tnd">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol"
                   description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
What dose, in milligrams, will be required at that time to get the concentration back
to 2/3 of the initial concentration?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$Q1m">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol"
                   description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
Note that now the doctor can repeat this calculation to determine how
often he must give a this new dose to maintain the concentrations in
the range he believes will be effective.
