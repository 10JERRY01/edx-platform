A wire is not a simple thing: it is not a node.  A wire is a physical
object that has properties.  For example, in power transmission lines
the resistance of the wire is very important.  When we work at very
high frequencies, the capacitance of nearby wires to each other and
even the inductance of the wire and the mutual inductances between
wires can be important.  We call these unwanted interactions
"parasitics'.  They break our lumped-circuit abstraction, so we need
to know just how bad they are.
<br/><br/>
Let's look at the effect of the inductance of a wire lead on a
component.  A typical 1/4 Watt discrete resistor comes with 1.5 inch
leads of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge"> AWG
#20 </a> wire, one for each terminal.  We usually mount such a part
using only a bit of that wire.  Suppose we end up with a total of 2cm
of wire in series with that resistor.  AWG #20 wire has a diameter of
0.812mm.  So 2cm of this wire has an inductance of about \($Ln\)nH.
(The estimate of inductance is computed from from a
<a href="http://www.eeweb.com/toolbox/wire-inductance">
 magic formula </a> that is
not part of this subject.  You can learn about this in an electromagnetic theory
subject.)  We will ignore the resistance of the 2cm of wire... 
<br/><br/>

Suppose we have a voltage source that turns on (it goes from
\(0\) to \(V\)) at \(t=0\), and suppose it is connected to an
\(R_O\) load through a resistor \(R_S\) and a
wire with inductance \(L\).  Let's model the situation as follows:

Assume that the initial voltage across the load is zero.  What is the
final voltage across the load?  Write an algebraic expression for this
final value in terms of the parameters given:

Now, let's get down to numbers.  Let \(V =$V\)V, \(R_S=$RS\Omega\),
\(R_O=$RO\Omega\), and \(L=$Ln\)nH.  How much time, in nanoseconds, does it take for the
output voltage to reach \(v_O=$vgoal\)V?

<startouttext/>
This is a pretty significant amount of time!  For comparison, how
long, in nanoseconds,
does light take to go 2cm?  Remember, the speed of light is
