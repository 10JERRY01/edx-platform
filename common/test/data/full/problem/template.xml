It is sometimes necessary make precision measurements of light.  Such
measurements are often done with a

A silicon photodiode produces a very small current proportional to the amount of
light that hits it, but it does this only over a small range of
voltages.  So we need to sense this current and amplify it to some
easily measured value.  We also need to maintain an approximately
constant voltage across the diode.  A first-cut attack on this problem is
as follows:
