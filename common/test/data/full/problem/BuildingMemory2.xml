Suppose that STORE is low, so the switch is off, but now we have a 
leakage resistance to worry about.
<br/><br/>
The capacitor has a capacitance of \($CGSf\)fF and the
leakage resistance \(R_{IN}=$RING\)G\(\Omega\).

How much time, in microseconds, does it take to
discharge the capacitor from \(V_{S}=$VS\)V to \(V_{OH}=$VOH\)V, with
