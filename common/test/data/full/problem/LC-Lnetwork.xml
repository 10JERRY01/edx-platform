The inductor and capacitor in the diagram below are part of the
output-coupling network of a radio transmitter.  The rest of the
transmitter (the source of radio-frequency energy) is represented as a
Thevenin source, and the antenna load is represented by a resistor.

In this problem we will examine some of the characteristics of this
circuit. In the spaces provided below you will write 
algebraic expressions in terms of the part parameters
\(L\), \(C\), \(R_1\), \(R_2\), and the angular frequency \(\omega\).
(As usual, use \(w\) for \(\omega\) in your expressions.)

One thing we want to know is the voltage-transfer ratio (the ratio of
the complex amplitude of the output voltage to the complex amplitude
of the input voltage)
\(\frac{V_o}{V_i}\) of this network, as a function of the operating
frequency.  Now that we know about impedances this is just like
solving a resistive ladder!  In the space provided below write an
algebraic expression for this ratio.

Look carefully at what you just computed.  What is it for
\(\omega=0\)?  What happens as \(\omega\rightarrow\infty\)?
You should always examine system functions this way.
<endouttext/>

<br/>
Another important value is the driving-point impedance that the final
amplifier "sees" looking at the antenna through the coupling network.
This is the ratio of the complex amplitude of the voltage across the
input port to the complex amplitude of the current into that port.  In
this circuit it is \(\frac{V_f}{I_f}\).  In the space provided below write an
algebraic expression for this impedance.  (Hint: The algebra is often
easier if you invert parallel impedances to make admittances.  They
then just add.)

Again, look carefully at what you just computed.  What is it for
\(\omega=0\)?  What happens as \(\omega\rightarrow\infty\)?

Remember that we found that in resistive circuits the load that
absorbs the maximum power from a Thevenin source is the one where the
load resistance is the same as the source resistance.  Here we have an
antenna that we want to transfer power to, but both the amplifier and
the load have given resistances \(R_1\) and \(R_2\).  
Since capacitors and inductors do not eat power, they just store the
energy temporarily, perhaps if we choose the inductance and capcitance
wisely we can couple the amplifier to the antenna very well.
<br/>
It is possible to find values of \(L\) and \(C\) that make
the driving-point impedance you just computed exactly \(R_1\), if
\(R_1 &gt; R_2\).  This will "match the antenna to the amplifier".
<br/>
<!-- Note: R1 must be bigger than R2 for the tests to work -->
In the space provided below write an algebraic expression for the
capacitance \(C_{match}\) that allows this match:

Now let's look at some real numbers.  For a big transmitting amplifier
the output resistance may be \(R_1=$Rp\Omega\).  A typical antenna has
a radiation resistance of \(R_2=$Ra\Omega\).  Consider an AM broadcast
transmitter at \(f = $fk\)kHz.  In the spaces provided below, write
the numerical values of the capacitance (in picoFarads) and inductance
(in microHenrys) for match.
<br/>
\(C_{match}=\)

<startouttext/>
<br/>
\(L_{match}=\)

<numericalresponse answer="$Lmu">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol"
                   description="Numerical Tolerance"/> 
    <textline/>
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
By the way, AM broadcast transmitters can be very large: up to 50kW.
The parts used for such power levels are impressive.  For example, an
inductor may be made of large gauge silver-coated copper tubing.
