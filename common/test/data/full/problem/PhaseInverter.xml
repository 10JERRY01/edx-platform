The circuit shown below has two MOSFETs.  The input signal is
presented to the gate of \(Q_1\).  \(Q_2\) is configured as
the two-terminal device that you explored in exercise S10E2.  Here,
\(Q_2\), with its gate connected to its drain, is used as a
replacement for the load resistor in a common-source amplifier.

Assume that the MOSFETs are identical, with parameters \(K\) and
\(V_T\).  Note that it is hard to get close to identical transistors
if they are discrete components, but one can get pretty good matched 
pairs on an integrated circuit chip.

We want to set the input bias \(V_{IN}\) high enough to keep \(Q_1\)
out of cutoff.  If we want to be able to swing the input voltage up
and down by \(Dv\), what is the minimum value for the input bias
voltage?  Write an algebraic expression involving \(Dv\) and \(V_T\)
for this minimum value of \(V_{IN}\).

What is the minimum value that the power
supply voltage \(V_{DD}\) must be to ensure that both transistors are

the space provided below:

Notice that, for the approximations we use in this class, the behavior
of this circuit is quite independent of the detailed properties of the
MOSFETs.  This is very useful.
