The inverting amplifier is a very flexible concept.

We now know that for two resistors, the gain of this
configuration approaches \( \frac{v_O}{v_I} = - \frac{R_F}{R_S} \)
as the op amp approaches the ideal.
<br/>

We have also learned that this idea can be generalized to elements
that store energy.  For example, if we use a capacitor in the feedback
path (\(U_F\) is a capacitor of capacitance \(C\) and \(U_S\) is a
resistor of resistance \(R\)), then 
<center>
\( v_O = -\frac{1}{R C}\int_{-\infty}^t v_I(t) dt \)
</center>
Suppose that we make \(U_S\) an inductor with inductance \(L\) and
\(U_F\) a resistor with resistance \(R\).  Using the same reasoning we
will also get an integrator of the form:
<center>
\( v_O = A\int_{-\infty}^t v_I(t) dt \)
</center>
In the space provided below give an algebraic expression for \(A\) in
the formula above:

<formularesponse type="cs" samples="R,C,L@1,1,1:3,3,3#10" answer="$A">
    <responseparam description="Numerical Tolerance" type="tolerance"
    default="0.00001" name="tol" /> 
    <textline size="40" />    
</formularesponse>

For even more fun, we could put a capacitor in for \(U_F\) and an
inductor in for \(U_S\), yielding
<center>
\( v_O = B\int_{-\infty}^t\int_{-\infty}^t v_I(t) dt^2 \)
</center>
In the space provided below give an algebraic expression for \(B\) in
the formula above:
<endouttext/>
<formularesponse type="cs" samples="R,C,L@1,1,1:3,3,3#10" answer="$B">
    <responseparam description="Numerical Tolerance" type="tolerance"
    default="0.00001" name="tol" /> 
    <textline size="40" />    
</formularesponse>
