<startouttext/> 
Joe is hooking up his hifi system.  His amplifier is
claimed to be able to pump \($P\)W RMS into his \($RL\Omega\)
speaker.  From the point of view of the speaker, the amplifier can be
modeled as a Thevenin source with an internal resistance of
\(R_{TH}=$RTH\Omega\).
<endouttext/>

<startouttext/> 
<br/><br/>
What is the maximum open-circuit voltage, in Volts RMS, that the
amplifier can deliver?

Joe buys a roll of #18AWG speaker wire.  He needs to run \($l\)m of
wire (a \($l2\)m round trip) to the speaker from his amplifier.  The
resistance of #18AWG copper wire is about \($rwk\Omega\)/km.
<br/><br/>
If Joe uses the wire he bought to connect the amplifier to the speaker
then when his amplifier is putting out \($va\)V RMS at the amplifier
terminals, what is the voltage, in Volts RMS, at the speaker terminals?
