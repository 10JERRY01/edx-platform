   In exercise S10E2 we saw the two-terminal device formed by
   connecting the gate to the drain of a MOSFET, as illustrated in the
   figure below.

   As usual, the MOSFET is specified in terms of two parameters, \(K\)
   and \(V_T\).

   A small-signal model of the MOSFET can be used to make a
   small-signal model of the two-terminal device, as illustrated below:

   The coefficient \(g_m\) of the incremental voltage \(v_{gs}\) in the linear
   dependent current source is called the "transconductance" of the
   MOSFET.  Given that the bias voltage across the MOSFET is
   \(V\), write an algebraic expression for the transconductance
   of the MOSFET in this circuit.  Your expression should be expressed
   in terms of \(K\), \(V_T\), and \(V\).  Enter your expression in
   the space provided below:

   The two-terminal device can be interpreted as a resistor for small signals.

   In the space provided below, write an algebraic expression for the
   incremental resistance presented by this two-terminal device, in
   terms of \(K\), \(V_T\) and the bias voltage \(V\).
