Suppose we are making an NMOS chip with \($ngatesM\) million gates, to run at a
frequency of \($freqG\)GHz.  Our process makes MOSFETs with a
gate-source capacitance of \($Cf\)fF, and our pullups are
\($RLk\)k\(\Omega\).  The \(R_{ON} = $RON\Omega \ll R_L \), so we can
ignore it.
Suppose also that we chose to use a \($VS\)V power supply (a bad idea!).
<br/>
What is the average static power, in milliWatts, that a gate in this
process dissipates?

What is the average dynamic power, in microWatts, that a gate in this
process dissipates?

Now, we have \($ngatesM\) million gates, so what power does the whole chip
dissipate? (In kiloWatts.)

To put this into perspective, consider the Sun.
The <a href="http://www.ips.gov.au/Category/Educational/The%20Sun%20and%20Solar%20Activity/General%20Info/Solar_Constant.pdf">
luminosity </a> of the Sun (the total power output) is about \($lum
\times 10^{26}\)W.
The 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radius"> radius </a>
of the Sun is about \($radk\)km.  Thus each square centimeter of the
surface of the
Sun is putting out \($radiationKwcm2\)kW/cm\(^2\).
<br/>
But our chip is about a square centimeter; a difficult problem
for cooling!  We cannot make chips this way.
