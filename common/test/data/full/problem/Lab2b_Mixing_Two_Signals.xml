<problem><startouttext/><p/>A circuit that combines two or more signals is called a <i>mixer</i>.  In
this lab, your goal is to build a mixer that combines the signals generated by
two voltage sources, V1 and V2.

<br/><br/><ul style="margin-left:2em;">
V1 is a 1 kHz square wave that varies between 0V and +1V.
<br/><br/>
V2 is a 5 kHz sine wave that varies between -1V and +1V.
<br/><br/>
</ul>

Please design a circuit that mixes V1 and V2 to produce Voutput such
that

<center>\[V_{output} \approx \frac{1}{2}V_1 + \frac{1}{6}V_2\]</center>

The resulting output should be similar to that shown in Figure 1.  The maximum
value of the output is approximately \(667mV\) and the minimum value is approximately
\(-167mV\).

<p/>Hint: Figure 2 shows a simple resistive mixer for combining two signals.

<p/>Enter your circuit below, using the appropriate configuration of resistors.
Please do not modify the wiring or parameters of the voltage sources -- your
goal is to take the signals they generate and combine them, not to change what
is generated.  Run a 5ms transient analysis to verify the correct operation
of your circuit.

<p/>When you're done or if you wish to save your work, please click CHECK.  The checker
will be verifying the voltage of the output node at several different times,
so you'll earn a checkmark only <i>after</i> you've performed the transient simulation
so that the checker will have a waveform to check!
