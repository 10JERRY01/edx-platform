In working with complex exponentials we need some simple rules and
short cuts for doing the algebra. 
<br/><br/>
Remember that a complex number \(z\) is a vector in the
2-dimensional plane.  It has a length (also called "magnitude")
\(|z|\) and an angle \(\angle(z)\) measured counterclockwise from the
real axis.  You need to know the following facts: 
<br/><br/>
<p>
\( \operatorname{Re}(a + jb) = a \); \(\ \ \ \)
\( \operatorname{Im}(a + jb) = b \)
</p>

<p>
\( |a + jb| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) ; \(\ \ \ \)

\( \angle(a + jb) = \arctan(b,a) \)
</p>

<p>
\( |z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2| \) ; \(\ \ \ \)

\( \left|\frac{z_1}{z_2}\right| = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|} \)
</p>

<p>
\( \angle(z_1 z_2) = \angle(z_1) + \angle(z_2) \); \(\ \ \ \)

\( \angle(\frac{z_1}{z_2}) = \angle(z_1) - \angle(z_2) \)
</p>

<p>
\( |e^{j\theta}| = 1 \); \(\ \ \ \)

\( \angle(e^{j\theta}) = \theta \)
</p>
<br/>
Now let's practice on the problem before us.  We have a complex
particular solution:
<br/><br/>
\( v_{PS}(t) = V_i \frac{1}{1+j\omega R C}e^{j\omega t} \)
<br/><br/>
Let's get its magnitude.  The complex number before us is a product of
factors, so its magnitude is the product of the magnitude of the
factors. \(V_i\) is a real number, so its magnitude
is its absolute value.
The second factor is a quotient, so its
magnitude is the quotient of the magnitudes of the numerator and the
denominator. 
The third factor is a unit vector; so its magnitude is 1.
<br/>
What is the magnitude of \(v_{PS}\)?  Express your
result in terms of \(V_i\), \(\omega\), \(R\) and \(C\).  (Since we
have no easy way for you to enter the Greek letter \(\omega\), please
use the Roman letter \(w\) for the angular frequency.)

<br/>
Now let's get the angle.  The angle of the product is the sum of the
angles.  The angle of the first factor, the real number \(V_i\) is just either \(0\) if
it is positive or \(\pi\) if it is negative.  Assume \(V_i\) is
positive here.  The angle of the second factor is just the difference
of the angle of the numerator and the angle of the denominator.  The
angle of the third factor is the imaginary part of the exponent.
<br/>
What is the angle of \(v_{PS}\)?  Express your
result in terms of \(V_i\), \(\omega\), \(t\), \(R\) and \(C\).  (Since we
have no easy way for you to enter the Greek letter \(\omega\), please
use the Roman letter \(w\) for the angular frequency.)
