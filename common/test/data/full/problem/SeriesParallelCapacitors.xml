Now we know that the voltage-current behavior of a capacitor of
capacitance \(C\) is:
<br/>
<center>
\(i_C = C \frac{d v_C(t)}{d t} \)
</center>
<br/>
It turns out that, just like with resistors, various combinations of
capacitors are terminal-equivalent to a single capacitor with a
capacitance determined from the capacitances of the parts of the
combination.  For each of the following circuits give the capacitance
of an equivalent capacitor, as seen from the exposed terminals.

First, let's look at two capacitors in parallel:

Think in terms of the geometry: how can two capacitors in parallel be
thought of as one?

in terms of  \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) that makes these terminal equivalent.
