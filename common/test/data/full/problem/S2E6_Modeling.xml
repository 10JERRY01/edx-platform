Joe has a barn that is \($l\) feet from his house.  He needs to supply 
1000 Watts at 240V to a resistive load at his barn from the 60Hz power line at his house.
Note that the circuit from the house to the barn requires two
lengths of the interconnecting wire.
He proposes to use number \($g\) AWG wire to connect his house to his
barn. (AWG is American Wire Gauge: a specification of the size of
the wire.  For more information 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge">see</a>.)  
Number \($g\) AWG copper wire has a resistance of \($r\Omega\) per 1000
feet.
