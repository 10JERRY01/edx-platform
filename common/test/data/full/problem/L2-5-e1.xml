<startouttext /> 
<br /> Notice that in any circuit there is always one more node than there
are independent KCL equations.  If two nodes share a branch, the
current entering one node from that branch is the negative of the
current entering the other node from that branch.  So the sum of the
currents entering two nodes does not count current going from one to
the other.  As a consequence, the sum of all the currents entering all
but one of the nodes is the same as the current entering the remaining
node.  So the KCL equation for that node is the sum of the KCL
equations for all the other nodes.

<br /><br /> Also, in a circuit with more than one loop there are always more loops
than KVL equations.  The argument is analogous with the argument for
nodes: if two loops share a branch, and we count the voltages
counterclockwise in each loop, then the KVL equation for the branches
containing both subloops is the sum of the KVL equations for each
subloop.  This bigger equation does not count the current in the
shared branch, since it is of opposite sign in the two subloops.

<br /><br /> A thought: if you have take a class in multivariate calculus, these
arguments should remind you of the proofs of the divergence theorem
and of Stokes's theorem.
