<startouttext />
In the network shown you are given that \(V=$V\)V and \(I=$I\), and that the
resistors have the resistances \(R_1 = $R1 \Omega\) and \(R_2 = $R2 \Omega\).

There are three node potentials labeled in this network \(e_1\),
\(e_2\), and \(e_3\).  We can choose any node to be the reference node
(the ground) from which voltages are measured, setting the
corresponding node potential to zero.  (Only voltages, which are
differences of node potentials, are physically meaningful.)
Let's start by choosing the ground at the negative terminal of the
voltage source, so \(e_3 = 0\).
<endouttext />

<startouttext />
<br /> What is the value (in Volts) of the node potential \(e_1\)?
<endouttext />
<numericalresponse answer="$V">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext />
<br /> Now there is one remaining unknown node, with potential \(e_2\).
Write a node equation for that node.  What is the value (in Volts) of \(e_2\)?
<endouttext />
<numericalresponse answer="$e">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext />
<br /> What is the voltage (in Volts) \(v_2\) across the resistor with resistance \(R_2\)?
<endouttext />
<numericalresponse answer="$v2">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext />
<br /> <br /> Now, let's start again.  Suppose we chose a different node as the
ground reference.  Let's choose the top terminal of the current
source, where it connects to the two resistors.  So now \(e_2 = 0\),
and there are two remaining nodes.  But if we know \(e_3\) then we
know that \(e_1 = e_3 + V\), so we still have only one unknown.
What is the value (in Volts) of the node potential \(e_3\)?
<endouttext />
<numericalresponse answer="$en">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext />
<br /> Now, what is the voltage (in volts) \(v_2\) across the resistor with resistance \(R_2\)?
<endouttext />
<numericalresponse answer="$v2">
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance" />
    <textline />
</numericalresponse>

<startouttext />
<br /> Notice that the voltage across the resistor is the same, independent
of the choice of the node chosen for the reference potential.  Indeed, the physics does
not care about the potentials, only the voltages that are their differences.
