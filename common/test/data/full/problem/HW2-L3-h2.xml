A simple model of a photovoltaic solar cell is a current source, with
the current proportional to the amount of sunlight falling on it.  A
more accurate model includes a diode (a nonlinear element we will see
later).  There is some leakage current that we can model with a
parallel resistor, and there is a voltage drop in the interconnect
that we can model with series resistances connecting to the load
resistor.  So a crude model of a complete system might be the circuit
shown below.

In this system we have \(I=$I\)A, \(R_p=$Rp\Omega\), and \(R_s=$Rs\Omega\).

You are to determine the load resistance, \(R_L\), for which the
maximum power is transferred to the load.  (Hint: remember your calculus!)
<br/>
What is this optimum load resistance (in Ohms)?
