A capacitor is a device that stores energy in the electric field
between its two conductive plates.  The characteristic parameter \(C\)
of a capacitor is called "capacitance", which is measured in units of
Farads, after Michael Faraday, who invented fields as a way of
understanding electromagnetic phenomena.  See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday"> Faraday</a>
for more historical information about this great scientist/engineer.
<br/><br/>
For a mechanical analogy, if we think of charge in an electrical
system as analogous to displacement in a mechanical system, so current
is analogous to velocity, and voltage
in an electrical system as analogous to force in a mechanical system
then the law for a linear capacitor is analogous to the law for a
linear spring:
<br/><br/>
<center>
\(v=\frac{1}{C} Q\ \Longleftrightarrow\ F = k x\)
</center>
<br/><br/>
and
<br/><br/>
<center>
\(i = C \frac{d v}{d t}\)
</center>
<br/><br/>
The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is determined by its geometry and the
material (called the dielectric) that is between its plates.  As you
just seen in the lecture segment, the capacitance of a parallel-plate
capacitor is directly proportional to the area of the plates and
inversely proportional to the distance between the plates.  
<br/><br/>
<center>
\( C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} \)
</center>
<br/><br/>
The constant of proportionality \(\epsilon\) is called the "permittivity".
The permittivity is a property of the material between the plates.

Suppose we double the length, width, and depth of a capacitor, by what
multiple does the capacitance increase?

The permittivity of the vacuum is \(\epsilon_0 \approx
8.854\times10^{âˆ’12}\)F/m.  This is also called the
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?ep0|search_for=universal_in!">
  electric constant</a>.
Non-conductive materials that can be put between the plates, such as
polyethylene, have higher permittivity than the vacuum.  The ratio of
the permittivity of a material to the permittivity of the vacuum is
called the "relative permittivity" or the "dielectric constant" of the
material.  For example, the dielectric constant of polyethylene is
2.25.  For more information 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_permittivity">see</a>. 
<br/>
As a consequence of the very small permittivity of the vacuum, most
common capacitors have a capacitance of only a tiny part of a Farad.
For example, what is the capacitance (in Farads) of a parallel-plate capacitor
with plates \($length\)m long, \($wcm\)cm wide, and separated by \($tmm\)mm of
polyethylene?

Of course, for such a capacitor the plates would be thin foil or metal
deposited on the dielectric film.  The result would be rolled up
into a tight package, with wire leads bonded to the foil plates, and
hermetically sealed.
<br/>
So commonly available approximately linear capacitors range from
picoFarads (pF) through microFarads (uF).  Electrolytic capacitors,
which are not very linear, can easily be obtained in the
thousands of microFarad range.
