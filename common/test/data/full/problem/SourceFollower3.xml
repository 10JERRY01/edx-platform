We have been studying the source follower in H5P1 and H5P2.

<br/>
Now we have a small-signal model of the MOSFET.  Using this model of
the MOSFET the small-signal model of the source-follower looks like:
<center>
<img src="/static/circuits/source-follower-small-signal-model.gif" />
</center>
<br/>
where \(g_m\) is the transconductance of the MOSFET at the operating
point. 
<br/>
Notice that the small-signal circuit is linear with independent sources.

Assume that you have already determined the operating point of the
MOSFET: it is saturated; the input bias voltage is \(V_{IN}\), and the
bias current is \(I_{DS}\).
<br/> 
In the space provided below write an algebraic expression for the
transconductance \(g_m\) in terms of the device parameters \(K\),
\(V_T\), \(R_S\), and the bias conditions \(V_{IN}\), and \(I_{DS}\).

In the space provided below, write an algebraic expression for the incremental gain \(a =

Now let's get the output resistance of this source follower.  
<br/> <br/> 
To do this:
<br/>
1. Suppress the independent source \(v_{in}\).  (Short it out.)
Remember, you may not suppress the dependent source.
<br/>
2. Add an independent current source to inject a current into the
output port.  Analyze the resulting circuit to get the voltage across
the output port.
<br/>
3. The ratio of the voltage you obtained and the current you injected
is the effective output resistance of this circuit.
<br/>
In the space provided below write an algebraic expression for the
output resistance \(r_{out} = \frac{v_{out}}{i_{out}}|_{v_{in}=0}\) in terms of \(g_m\) and \(R_S\).
<br/> <br/>
\(r_{out} =\)
<endouttext/>
<formularesponse type="cs" samples="gm,RS@1,1:3,3#10" answer="$ro">
    <responseparam description="Numerical Tolerance" type="tolerance" default="0.00001" name="tol" />
    <textline size="40" />    
</formularesponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/><br/>
Note that the input resistance \(r_i = \frac{v_i}{i_i} = \infty\)
because in our model there is no current allowed into the gate of a
MOSFET.  For low frequencies this is a good estimate.
But a real MOSFET has capacitance between its gate and its
other terminals.  So there are better models that allow us to estimate
the input "resistance" (impedance).  But you will have to wait until
we introduce capacitance!
