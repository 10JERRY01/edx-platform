We are presented with a familiar first-order circuit: a capacitor
driven by a Thevenin source.  Now we have a sinusoidal drive that
starts at \(t=0\). so the differential equation is
<br/><br/>
\( R C \frac{d v(t)}{d t} + v(t) = v_I(t) = V_i\cos(\omega t) u(t) \)
<br/><br/>
and we are given the initial state \(v(0_-)=0\).

We know how to solve this problem in the abstract.  
<br/> <br/>
<p>
1. Find a particular solution, \(v_P(t)\).
</p>
<p>
2. Form the general solution to the homogeneous equation \(v_H(t)\).
</p>
<p>
3. Form the total solution \(v(t) = v_P(t) + v_H(t)\).
</p>
<p>
4. Use the initial conditions to solve for the unknown coefficients in
the total solution.
</p>
Today we concentrate on finding the particular solution for
\(t&gt;0\), where the differential equation is:
<br/><br/>
\(R C \frac{d v_P(t)}{d t} + v_P(t) = V_i\cos(\omega t)\)
<br/><br/>
(Notice that we are using an upper-case name with a lower-case
subscript for amplitude of the sinusoid.)

The lecturer threw up his hands in disgust after three tries with
trigonometric functions.  He will go on to exponentials, which is
really a better idea.  But I think we should try one more
possibility... Let's try
<br/><br/>
\( v_P(t) = A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t) \)
<br/><br/>
If you substitute this into the differential equation you will find
that you can solve for the amplitudes \(A\) and \(B\) fairly easily.
(Hint: You will need the fact that \(\sin(\omega t)\) and
\(\cos(\omega t)\) cannot both be zero at the same time.)
<br/>
In the spaces provided below write algebraic expressions for these
amplitudes.  (Since we have no easy way for you to enter the Greek 
letter \(\omega\), please use the Roman letter \(w\) for the angular
frequency.)

<br/>
This wasn't so bad... The big problem here is that
<br/><br/>
\( A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t) = C \cos(\omega t + \phi) \)
<br/><br/>
and we really want \(C\) and \(\phi\), but the trigonometric
computation of these from \(A\) and \(B\) is pretty nasty.
<br/><br/>
We will find that exponentials are much nicer and easier to work
with.
