While further poking around in his experiment, Joe found an exposed
interconnect.  It connected the positive output of the \(5\)V power
supply, a \(3.3\Omega\) resistor, and two unknown 2-terminal elements,
as shown:

He couldn't trace where the other ends of the elements went.  However,
he had a nifty (very expensive!) Hall-effect clamp-on ammeter that he used
to measure the three of the four currents entering the elements.  He
didn't have enough space to measure the current entering the fourth
element.  He found that \(i_1=$i1\)A, \(i_3=$i3\)A, \(i_4=$i4\)A. 
<br /><br />
What was the current (in Amperes) \(i_2\) into the fourth element?

Joe managed to get his ammeter probe around a wire and measured
\(i_5\).  What current (in Amperes) did he measure?
