In the circuit just shown:
<center>
<img src="/static/circuits/CascadeInvertersCGS.gif" />

When the voltage at node A falls in a step from 5V to 0V, the voltage
at node B looks like one of the following traces.

Which trace is the correct one?  Write the letter corresponding to the
correct trace in the box provided below:

<answer type="loncapa/python">
correct = ['correct']

try:
  r = str(submission[0])
except ValueError:
  correct[0] = 'incorrect'
  r = "0"

if not r=="C":
  correct[0] = 'incorrect'

Note: You need a very fast (and thus very expensive) oscilloscope to
see traces like these.  You need to use a very low capacitance probe
and you must connect the oscilloscope to the circuit very carefully,
with a very short ground.
