Consider a proposal for using a capacitor as a digital memory:

</center>
Suppose that STORE is high so the switch is on.
Also assume that the switch has \(R_{ON} = $RON\Omega\) and
the capacitor has a capacitance of \($CGSf\)fF.  
<br/><br/>
How much time, in picoseconds, does it take to
charge the capacitor from \(V_{OL}=$VOL\)V to \(V_{OH}=$VOH\)V, with
\(d_{IN} = $VS\)V?

Now, suppose that \(d_{IN} = $VOL\)V.
How much time, in picoseconds, does it take to
discharge the capacitor from \(V_{OH}=$VOH\)V to \(V_{IL}=$VIL\)V?
