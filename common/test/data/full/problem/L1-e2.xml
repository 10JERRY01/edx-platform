A real battery is not an ideal independent voltage source.  A voltage
source is an appropriate idealization of the battery if the load on
the battery is negligible.  A better model for a battery is a voltage
source in series with an ideal linear resistor whose resistance varies
with temperature.  Sometimes even better models are required - this  
<a href="http://data.energizer.com/PDFs/BatteryIR.pdf">Energizer
  technical bulletin</a> gives more information.  However, let's use the simple model of a
linear resistor in series with an ideal independent voltage source, as
in the figure.

It is suggested in section 1.5.1 of the textbook that to increase the
current-capacity of a battery without increasing the voltage at the
terminals we can connect batteries of the same voltage in parallel.
Let's examine this using our model.

Let's assume that both component batteries have the same voltage
\(V_1=V_2=$V\).  The internal resistances of small batteries
are about \(0.2\Omega\), but they vary a bit.  Let's assume that 
\(R_1=$R1\) and \(R_2=$R2\).  What is the open-circuit voltage (in
Volts) \(V\) of the combination?

<br /> Now, suppose we short-circuit the compound battery.  (This is
very dangerous.  NEVER do this to a large battery, such as a lead-acid
battery in a car, or to a lithium-ion battery from your laptop.  You
MAY live to regret it, but you may not.)  What is the current (in Amperes) you
should expect to go through the short circuit?

<br /> We can think of this combination as a bigger battery of the
same voltage as the two component batteries.  What is the
equivalent resistance (in Ohms) of the compound battery?  (Hint: you have the
voltage with nothing connected and the current when shorted out.)

<br /> Now, suppose that the voltages of the two component batteries are not
quite the same.  For example, suppose that \(V_2 = $V2d\).  Then when
we hook the two batteries together current will flow and the higher
voltage battery will charge the lower voltage one.  What is the
current (in Amperes) that will flow?
