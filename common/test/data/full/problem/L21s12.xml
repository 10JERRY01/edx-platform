In the United States the frequencies between \($flowk\)kHz and \($fhighk\)kHz are
<a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/spectrum_wall_chart_aug2011.pdf">
allocated </a> to the AM radio broadcast band.  Stations are allocated
10kHz channels, so in the worst case two stations may be separated by
as little as 10kHz.  It is proposed that the channel-selection
mechanism for an AM radio could be modeled by the following circuit
that uses a variable capacitor to adjust the resonant frequency of 
a parallel tuned circuit.

In this exercise we will see why this cannot be the whole story.
<br/>
Assume that the antenna presents an impedance of \(R = $R\Omega\).
(This is not very realistic, but the real story is even worse, as we
will see!)
One
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic2/index1/VariableCap.html">
traditional </a> tuning capacitor for an AM radio receiver has
maximum capacitance of \(C_{max} = $Cmaxp\)pF.  This maximum
capacitance is used to resonate with the inductor at the lowest
frequency.  What is the inductance, in microHenrys, required to resonate with
\(C_{max}\) at the lower band edge \(f = $flowk\)kHz?

Given the inductance you just derived, what is the capacitance, in picoFarads, that
the variable capacitor will need to be set to for the circuit to

This bandwidth is way too large.  If we are listening to a station at
1030kHz and there is an interfering station at 1060kHz the carrier of
the interfering station will be hardly suppressed.  This is a serious
problem.  In a densely-populated place,
<a href="http://www.nyradioguide.com/amlist1.htm"> New York City </a>
for example, WHLI is at 1100kHz, WBBR is at 1130kHz, and WVNJ is at
1160kHz.
<br/>
To narrow the bandwidth we would have to raise the \(Q\).  But this
requires raising the value of \(R\), which is already very high: and
antenna radiation resistance is almost never this high, so we would
have to use a different way to couple the antenna to the tuned circuit
(a loop coupling, making the inductor the secondary of a transformer,
would help a lot).  But even worse, the bandwidth varies drastically
as we tune from one end of the band to the other.
<br/>
So this tuning scheme cannot be the whole story.  It is difficult to
make a single tuned circuit that can cover a wide frequency range (a
factor of 3 here) with a high enough \(Q\) to discriminate stations
even 30kHz apart.
