One way to measure the deformation of an object is with strain
gauges. A strain gauge is a resistor whose resistance varies with the
amount it is stretched or compressed.  For example, an 
<a href="http://www.omega.com/pptst/gen_purpose_strain_SG.html">
Omega SG-13/1000-LY11 </a> has a nominal undeformed resistance of
\(R_X = $RX\Omega\).  The change in resistance is very small: if the piece
of steel the gauge is bonded to stretches by \(\frac{\Delta l}{l} =
0.001\) the gauge increases resistance by only \($GF\Omega\). 
<br/>
To measure the strain we need to get a voltage proportional to the
change in resistance from the nominal resistance of the gauge.  This
is arranged with a circuit like this:
<center><img src="/static/circuits/Strain.gif"/></center>
<br/>
Let's start by assuming that \(R_A = $RA\Omega\),
\(R_B = $RB\Omega\), \(R_C = $RC\Omega\), and \(V_S = $VS\)V.
<br/><br/>
Note: In this problem it is necessary to compute your answers to
within 1% of the correct value.
<br/><br/>
What is the output voltage \(v_O\), in Volts, if the gauge is
not deformed? 
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$von"><responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/><textline/></numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
Now suppose the gauge stretches so its resistance changes to 
\(R_X = $rxp\Omega\).  What is the change in the output voltage, in
milliVolts? 
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$voponm"><responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/><textline/></numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
We would really like the output voltage to be zero when the gauge is
not deformed.  Keeping the other resistors the same, what should we
make the resistance \(R_B\) to accomplish this?  Express your answer
in Ohms.
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$rbb"><responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/><textline/></numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/><br/>
Now we want to choose some resistances to get the maximum sensitivity:
we want the biggest change in output voltage for a change in the gauge
resistance.  We also want the output voltage to be zero when the gauge is
not deformed.
<br/> <br/>
Assume that we are given \(R_A = $rax\Omega\), and remember that the
nominal undeformed resistance of the gauge \(R_X = $RX\Omega\).
What value should we choose for \(R_C\), in Ohms?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$RX"><responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/><textline/></numericalresponse>

<startouttext/>
<br/>
What value should we choose for \(R_B\), in Ohms?
<endouttext/>
<numericalresponse answer="$rax"><responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/><textline/></numericalresponse>
