    <section class="tutorials">
      <h2>Basic Tutorials </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/section/is_it_linear/">Is
    it linear?</a> - We step through a set of common
    circuit elements (including several not yet seen in
    lecture), and let you try to guess whether they are
    linear or nonlinear.  </li>
        <li><a href="/section/getting_data/">How good is the lightbulb
    model? </a> - We measure a real lightbulb, and see how well a
    resistor models it. </li>
        <li><a href="/section/superposition">Superposition</a> - We solve
    the circuit from <a href="/section/3r_nodal/">last week's
    tutorial</a> using superposition, and see how much faster this
    is. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Worked Problems </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/section/sec_3_ex_5_6_pt1">OCW Ex 3.2/AL Exercise 3.2 parts a-d</a> - We go from a truth table to logic gates to NAND gates</li>
        <li><a href="/section/6002-Tutorial-Week2Thev"> Thevenin Example </a> - We go through an example of the Thevenin circuit. </li>
        <li><a href="/section/Thevenin">Thevenin Example 2</a> - A different way of looking at Thevenin.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Bonus Material </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/section/speakers">Speakers, heatsinks, and
    houses</a> - We show how to apply electrical models to
    understanding homemade speakers and insulating houses.</li>
      </ul>
