Responsibilities
================
The course_api app provides a read-only REST endpoint that allows you to quickly query and filter for certain block types across an entire course run's courseware content. For instance, you might want a list of all videos in the course, or a list of all problems in the course. The container/child relations are also returned.

It is used by the native mobile applications for iOS and Android.

Direction: Keep
===============
The performance of this endpoint on large courses could be improved, but there is no strong pressure to do any work on this app at this time.
